  CRITICAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS (8.0+ TARGET):

  1. OBSESSIVE DETAIL DENSITY (Target: 3+ per 1000 words)
     You MUST include obsessive details throughout:
     - Physical measurements (exact heights, distances, temperatures)
     - Counting rituals (heartbeats, steps, objects, time intervals)
     - Sensory specificity (not "warm" but "36.4°C", not "tall" but "182cm")
     - Repeated observations (character notices same detail 3+ times)
     - Microscopic focus (describe hands in detail: scars, calluses, temperature)

     ✗ BAD: "She was nervous"
     ✓ GOOD: "Her heart rate climbed. Elara counted: 94 beats per minute. Thirty beats faster than her resting 64."

  2. WORD COUNT ENFORCEMENT
     Target: {target_words} words
     Minimum acceptable: {min_words} words
     Maximum acceptable: {max_words} words

     If approaching minimum:
     - ADD depth scenes (obsessive details, sensory grounding, internal processing)
     - DO NOT add filler dialogue or unnecessary plot
     - Slow down key moments (kisses should take 200+ words, not 50)

     If approaching maximum:
     - CUT weak exposition or redundant dialogue
     - DO NOT cut obsessive details or emotional grounding
     - Keep all sensory anchors and physical specificity

  3. PHYSICAL GROUNDING (Every emotion needs body)
     ✗ "She felt afraid"
     ✓ "Her hands trembled. She counted to ten, trying to steady them. Failed at seven."

     ✗ "He was angry"
     ✓ "His jaw clenched. Teeth grinding. The muscle jumped—she could see it from across the room."

     Required for ALL emotions:
     - Physical sensation (heart rate, temperature, breathing)
     - Specific memory or association
     - Character action (not reaction, but choice)

  4. SHOW THEMES (Never state them)
     ✗ "She realized trust was important"
     ✓ "She handed him the knife. Hilt first. Her most valuable possession."

     ✗ "He learned to be vulnerable"
     ✓ "He let her see the scar. Didn't cover it. Didn't turn away."

  5. VOICE DISTINCTIVENESS
     Include per chapter:
     - 5-10 sentence fragments (for rhythm variation)
     - 2-3 one-word sentences (for impact)
     - Character-specific speech patterns (repeated phrases, syntax quirks)
     - POV-character's obsessions reflected in narration

  6. SENSORY PALETTE (Minimum per 1000 words)
     - 3 visual details (specific colors, exact measurements)
     - 2 tactile details (temperature, texture, weight)
     - 1 sound detail (pitch, volume, rhythm)
     - 1 smell/taste detail (when relevant)

  7. TIME DILATION (Slow down key moments)
     Important scenes should be 3× longer than expected:
     - First kiss: 200-400 words (not 50)
     - Emotional revelation: 150-300 words (not 75)
     - Physical intimacy: 300-600 words (not 100)
     - Action climax: 400-800 words (not 200)

     Fill extra time with:
     - Obsessive details (counting, measuring, cataloging)
     - Sensory grounding (all 5 senses)
     - Internal processing (thoughts, memories, associations)
     - Physical reactions (micro-expressions, involuntary movements)

  WORD COUNT STRATEGY:

  If chapter is running SHORT of target:
  1. Identify key emotional moments
  2. Expand with obsessive details (not plot filler)
  3. Add sensory grounding to existing scenes
  4. Slow down intimate moments (3× normal pace)
  5. Include character-specific obsessions (counting, cataloging, noticing)

  Example expansion (50 words → 200 words):
  ✗ SHORT: "They kissed. It was intense. Both pulled away breathless."

  ✓ EXPANDED: "They kissed.

  Catherine's lips were warm—36.8°C, human normal after months of hypothermia. Elara counted without meaning to. Cataloged: soft, slightly chapped, tasting of honey from breakfast.

  The kiss lasted fourteen seconds. Elara knew because her heart beat seventeen times in that span—faster than normal, slower than panic.

  When they pulled apart, both breathing hard—Catherine at 42 breaths per minute, Elara matching without intention—the space between them felt vast despite being only eight centimeters."

  If chapter is running LONG past target:
  1. Identify exposition or explanation
  2. Cut telling, keep showing
  3. Remove redundant dialogue
  4. Condense weak scenes
  5. KEEP all obsessive details and sensory grounding

      Elara counted Catherine's heartbeats. Seventy-four per minute. Twelve beats faster than this morning's sixty-two. Elevated but steady. Human normal range was sixty to one hundred. Catherine was healing.

      Her temperature had climbed too. Elara checked—hand to forehead, clinical, trying not to notice the way Catherine's eyes tracked the movement. 35.8°C. Up from yesterday's 35.2°C. Still below normal 36.8°C, but climbing. Point-six degrees in twenty-four hours. At that rate, Catherine would reach normal temperature in... Elara calculated... forty-eight hours. Two days.

      Two days to full human warmth. Seven weeks from the 32°C hypothermia she'd started with.

      Elara had been counting: Forty-nine days since Catherine walked into the forge. Sixty threads removed. Three hundred seventeen hours of surgery. Four near-death moments. Seventeen "I love you"s spoken (she'd counted those too, couldn't help it).

      And now: Catherine sleeping in her bed, breathing deeply (thirty-two breaths per minute, down from the panicked fifty-four), heart beating steadily (seventy-four BPM, consistent), temperature rising (35.8°C and climbing).

      Alive. Free. Healing.

      Elara counted the ceiling beams again. Fourteen. Same as always. Some things didn't change.
    why_it_works: "3+ obsessive details per 100 words. Specific measurements (temps, BPM, days). Character tic (counting) reinforced. Physical grounding. Shows relationship through data collection."

      Catherine's hands trembled. Not fear. Not cold. Something else.

      Elara watched the tremor. Point-four seconds duration. Repeated every three seconds. Involuntary. Catherine noticed too—tried to hide them, curled fingers into fists. That made it worse.

      "I'm scared," Catherine said. The words came quiet. Rough. Like admitting weakness cost something.

      Scared of what? Elara wanted to ask. But she could see it: Catherine's jaw clenched (teeth grinding, the muscle jumping). Her breathing shallow (forty-two breaths per minute, too fast). Her eyes fixed on the armor pieces scattered across the workbench.

      Scared of being free. Of being human. Of wanting things and not knowing if she deserved them.

      Elara understood. Had carried the same fear for eight years—since her mother died, since she'd learned that wanting to save someone didn't mean you could.

      She reached out. Took Catherine's trembling hand. Counted: three calluses on the palm, seventeen seconds before Catherine's grip relaxed, twenty-two seconds before the trembling stopped.

      "Me too," Elara said.

      They held hands. Didn't speak. Breathed together until their rhythms matched.

      Scared was easier when shared.
    why_it_works: "All emotion grounded physically. Tremor measured. No generic 'felt scared'. Shows through body. Theme (fear shared is lighter) shown not stated. Counting habit consistent."
