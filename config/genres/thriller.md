# Thriller Genre Module

## PACING
- Chapter length: 2,000-3,500 words (shorter = faster)
- Action sequences: 4-8 word sentences, fragments allowed
- Breathing room: One slower chapter per 4-5 intense
- Never resolve tension at chapter end

## CHAPTER ENDINGS (PICK ONE)
1. Physical danger - cut before resolution
2. Revelation - information changes everything
3. Decision point - character must choose (don't show choice)
4. Arrival/discovery - reach destination, cut before seeing it
5. Time pressure - deadline approaching

## TENSION ESCALATION
- Try-fail cycles: Attempt → fail or succeed with complication
- Stakes ladder: Personal → loved ones → survival → community
- "Yes, but..." / "No, and..." - never clean victories

## ACTION SCENES
- Track spatial relationships explicitly
- Limit internal monologue to single-thought flashes
- Show consequences immediately (injuries affect next actions)
- Sensory focus: What POV notices under stress
- Peak action: "He ran. Door slammed. Glass shattered."

## RED HERRINGS
- Introduce through organic character behavior
- Must be explainable in retrospect
- Plant real clues during emotional moments
- Never cheat reader

## FORBIDDEN IN THRILLER
- Convenient coincidences helping protagonist
- Villain monologuing plans
- Protagonist surviving through luck repeatedly
- Info-dumps during action

## STRUCTURE
- Hook in first 3 paragraphs
- Ticking clock established early
- Escalating danger every chapter
- Midpoint: Major revelation or reversal
- Dark moment: All seems lost (75% mark)
- Climax: Direct confrontation with threat
