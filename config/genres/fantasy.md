## MAGIC SYSTEM (SANDERSON'S LAWS)

### First Law
Ability to solve conflict with magic = reader understanding of magic
- **Hard magic**: Defined rules, costs → CAN solve problems
- **Soft magic**: Mysterious → CAN ONLY CREATE problems

### Second Law
Limitations > Powers for reader interest

**Types**:
- Costs: Physical drain, sanity loss, pain, lifespan
- Weaknesses: Conditional vulnerabilities
- Restrictions: Materials, environment, time

### Third Law
Expand existing magic before adding new

## WORLD-BUILDING INTEGRATION
- **Incluing**: Scatter info through action, not exposition
- **Iceberg**: Know 10x more than appears on page
- **Character-driven**: Filter world through POV perception
- **No "As you know, Bob"** dialogue

## SUBGENRE PACING

### Epic Fantasy
- Multiple POV (limit 4-6)
- Longer chapters (3,500-5,000 words)
- Slower build, bigger payoffs
- Political intrigue, armies, prophecy

### Urban Fantasy
- First person common
- Faster pace, shorter chapters
- Contemporary voice + magic
- Series with recurring cast

### Romantasy
- Dual POV (near mandatory)
- Romance = fantasy in importance
- Fae courts, morally grey heroes
- Higher heat level expectations

4. Tests, allies, enemies
5. Approach to innermost cave
6. Ordeal (death and rebirth)
7. Reward

## FORBIDDEN IN FANTASY
- Prophecy removing all tension
- Chosen one with no agency
- Info-dump prologues
- Made-up words without context
- Deus ex machina magic
- Evil races (problematic)
- "Dark Lord" with no motivation

## CHAPTER STRUCTURE
