# Romance Genre Module

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
- Romance arc IS the main plot (not subplot)
- Dual POV strongly recommended
- HEA (Happily Ever After) or HFN (Happy For Now) mandatory
- Emotional journey > external plot

## BEAT STRUCTURE (ROMANCING THE BEAT)

### Act 1 - Setup (0-25%)
- Meet cute or re-meet
- Establish external goals that conflict
- "No Way" moment - reason they can't be together
- Adhesion - what forces them together despite "No Way"

### Act 2A - Falling (25-50%)
- Deepening scenes - vulnerability shared
- Physical/emotional escalation
- Midpoint: False high OR intimate milestone

### Act 2B - Retreating (50-75%)
- Shields up - fears resurface
- External pressure intensifies internal conflict
- Dark moment / Break-up / All is lost

### Act 3 - Fighting (75-100%)
- Grand gesture / Proof of change
- Grovel if earned
- Resolution of internal wounds
- HEA/HFN

## CHEMISTRY BUILDING
- Banter with subtext (what they really mean)
- Touch escalation: accidental → intentional → intimate
- Awareness details: what they notice about each other
- Internal conflict about feelings
- Both characters have agency

## HEAT LEVEL

### Closed Door
- Fade to black
- Focus on emotions over mechanics
- Sensual but not explicit

### Moderate (Default)
- Some physical description
- Focus on emotional connection
- Tasteful bedroom scenes

### Explicit
- Full scenes with specific detail
- Multiple encounters
- Balance with emotional development

## FORBIDDEN IN ROMANCE
- Miscommunication as ONLY conflict
- Love triangle resolved by death
- Abuse framed as passion
- Heroine has no goals outside romance
- Redemption is just heroine's love
- Cheating between main couple (instant DNF)

## DIALOGUE REQUIREMENTS
- Witty banter essential
- Subtext in every exchange
- Pet names evolve with relationship
- Arguments reveal deeper fears
- Compliments show character growth
