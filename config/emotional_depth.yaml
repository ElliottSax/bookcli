# Emotional Depth Configuration
# Replaces generic emotions with rooted, specific, human-feeling experiences

principle: "Every emotion anchored in specific physical sensation + specific memory"

transformation_rules:
  avoid:
    - "Character felt [emotion]"
    - "Character was [emotional state]"
    - "Generic emotional description"

  prefer:
    - "Physical manifestation + unexpected comparison + character action"
    - "Specific memory callback + present sensation"
    - "Emotion implied through behavior, never stated"

  template: "[Physical sensation] + [Specific memory/comparison] + [Character action]"

# Emotion transformation database
emotions:

  grief:
    physical_sensations:
      - "throat closed—airless crushing"
      - "chest cavity hollowed out"
      - "breathing through wet cotton"
      - "weight in stomach, physical and wrong"

    memory_anchors:
      - "from the funeral"
      - "like when Dad died"
      - "that hospital smell"
      - "the way Mom's voice broke"

    character_actions:
      - "swallowed hard"
      - "kept walking"
      - "closed eyes"
      - "clenched fists until it passed"

    examples:
      - "Marcus's throat closed—that familiar airless crush from the funeral, from every time someone said 'your dad.' He swallowed hard and kept walking."
      - "The grief came sideways. Not thinking about Dad, then suddenly smelling motor oil and sawdust—his work smell—and Marcus had to stop moving until the wave passed."

  fear:
    physical_sensations:
      - "cold sweat—fear sweat not exertion sweat"
      - "heart kicked against ribs"
      - "hands shook"
      - "stomach dropped, elevator-fall sensation"

    memory_anchors:
      - "hospital where Gran died—antiseptic over rot"
      - "that nightmare feeling"
      - "recognition—body knows danger"

    character_actions:
      - "forced hands still"
      - "kept breathing"
      - "didn't let it show"
      - "ran"

    examples:
      - "The corruption smelled like the hospital where Gran died—antiseptic and rot underneath. Lily's hands shook. She forced them still."
      - "Cold sweat. The bad kind. Lily had learned to differentiate—exertion sweat versus fear sweat. This was fear."

  love:
    physical_sensations:
      - "background hum—silence when absent"
      - "chest expanded, warm"
      - "wanted to touch, hold, preserve"

    memory_anchors:
      - "his laugh through the Veil—muffled, distorted, but hers"
      - "memorized his hands through crystal"
      - "five years of meetings"

    character_actions:
      - "reached for hand"
      - "memorized details obsessively"
      - "chose to stay"

    examples:
      - "Lyara remembered his laugh through the Veil—muffled, distorted, but hers. For five years, the only sound she'd wanted to hear."
      - "Thomas's presence was background hum. Gone, she'd feel the silence like missing teeth—tongue finding the gap obsessively."

  anger:
    physical_sensations:
      - "jaw ached from clenching"
      - "heat crawled up neck"
      - "hands wanted to hit something"

    memory_anchors:
      - "the unfair kind—kid getting blamed"
      - "violation he hadn't consented to"
      - "like with teachers, with Mom, now with Weavers"

    character_actions:
      - "fist-clenched until nails cut palms"
      - "gave anger somewhere to go"
      - "spoke carefully, controlled"

    examples:
      - "Marcus's jaw ached from clenching. The Weavers' voices in his skull—violation he'd never consented to. His marked palm burned."
      - "Heat crawled up Marcus's neck. The unfair kind. The kid-getting-blamed kind. He'd felt it with teachers, with Mom, now with alien beings treating him like disposable tool."

  hope:
    physical_sensations:
      - "maybe—word tasted fragile"
      - "channels ached but underneath—possibility"
      - "couldn't trust it yet"

    memory_anchors:
      - "learned to recognize false hope versus real"
      - "hope made you stupid"
      - "broke you if you leaned too soon"

    character_actions:
      - "didn't let himself finish the thought"
      - "held it carefully"
      - "tried not to want it too much"

    examples:
      - "Maybe. The word tasted fragile. Marcus had learned to recognize false hope versus real—this felt real. Slim, but real."
      - "If he could separate Lyara and Thomas... Marcus didn't let himself finish the thought. Hope was dangerous. Hope made you stupid."

  exhaustion:
    physical_sensations:
      - "channels burned—scorched earth"
      - "body refused to respond"
      - "bone-deep tired"
      - "vision blurred at edges"

    memory_anchors:
      - "after the Binding—three days unconscious"
      - "channel damage that wouldn't heal"
      - "the kind sleep didn't fix"

    character_actions:
      - "collapsed"
      - "kept moving anyway"
      - "found somewhere to fall"

    examples:
      - "Exhaustion that soaked into bone. The kind sleep didn't fix. Marcus kept walking anyway."
      - "His channels burned. Not sharp—deep. Background ache that meant he'd pushed too far again."

# Specificity requirements
specificity_requirements:

  minimum_score: 8.0  # Emotion must score 8+ on specificity

  required_elements:
    physical_manifestation: true  # Must include body sensation
    specific_sensory: true         # Must be specific not generic
    memory_anchor: true            # Should reference specific memory
    coping_action: true            # Character does something

  scoring:
    physical_manifestation: 2.5   # Points if present
    specific_sensory: 2.5          # Points if specific (not "cold" but "knife-edge cold")
    memory_anchor: 2.5             # Points if tied to specific memory
    coping_action: 2.5             # Points if character takes action
    # Total: 10 points possible
