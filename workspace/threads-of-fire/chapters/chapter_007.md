# Chapter 7

Catherine woke up screaming.

Elara was in the forge below, hammering out a commission, when it—the sound cutting through three floors of stone and wood. She dropped the hammer mid-strike and ran.

Catherine was sitting up in bed, both hands pressed to her chest, eyes wide and unseeing. Not awake. Not asleep. Somewhere in between where nightmares lived.

"Catherine." Elara crossed the room. Didn't touch—not yet, not when Catherine was this far inside panic. "You're in Ironhearth. In my room. You're safe."

No response. Catherine's breathing was fast, shallow, the kind that led to hyperventilation. Her hands clutched at her chest like she was searching for armor that wasn't there anymore.

"Catherine. Count with me. One. Two. Three."

Nothing.

Elara tried again. "Your heartbeat. Count it. I'll count with you."

That penetrated. Catherine's eyes focused . Her right hand moved from chest to wrist, finding her own pulse.

"Seventy-eight," Catherine said. Voice rough. "Seventy-nine. Eighty."

"Good. Keep counting."

They counted together. Catherine's pulse slowly dropping. Ninety. Eighty-five. Eighty-two. Seventy-eight. Seventy-four.

When it hit seventy, Catherine stopped shaking.

"I'm awake," she said.

"You were dreaming."

"I was remembering." Catherine looked down at her chest. At the bandages wrapping her torso where the heart threads had been removed. At her bare arms, both of them, free and human and vulnerable. "I dreamed the armor was back. That last night didn't happen. That I was still—"

She stopped. Swallowed.

Elara sat on the edge of the bed. Close but not touching. "It happened. You're free. Look."

She held up Catherine's gauntlet—the right one, the first piece they'd removed fourteen days ago. Catherine took it, turned it over in her hands. The metal was cold, lifeless. Not screaming anymore. an object instead of a prison.

"I can't put it back on," Catherine said quietly. "Even if I wanted to. The locking mechanism is destroyed. The threading is severed. I'm committed now."

"Regrets?"

"No. But—" Catherine's thumb traced the inner surface of the gauntlet. "Fear. What if I can't learn to be human again? What if seven years was too long? What if I'm too broken to fix?"

"You're not broken. You're healing. There's a difference."

"How do you know?"

"Because broken things don't breathe deeper when armor comes off. Broken things don't laugh at terrible metalwork. Broken things don't choose to live when dying would be easier." Elara met her eyes. "You're not broken, Catherine. You're remembering what it feels like to be whole."

Catherine set the gauntlet aside. "I slept for four hours. I haven't slept four consecutive hours in seven years. That's—"

"Progress."

"Terrifying. I don't know how to not be vigilant."

"So I'll be vigilant for you. While you heal."

"That's not sustainable."

"Neither is never sleeping. We'll figure it out."

The church bell chimed eight times. Eight in the morning. Catherine had fallen asleep at midnight after the chest piece removal. Eight hours ago. Four hours of actual sleep, four hours of restless half-consciousness.

Still more than she'd had in years.

"We should continue the removal," Catherine said.

"We should let you heal. You had major surgery twelve hours ago."

"Elara, we don't have time to—"

"One day. Your body needs rest. The threads aren't going anywhere."

Catherine looked like she wanted to argue. Then her hand went to her chest, pressed gently against the bandages. Flinched.

"Fine," she said. "One day."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. You're the one who's being unreasonable."

"I'm being medically responsible."

"You're a blacksmith, not a doctor."

"In this forge, I'm whatever keeps you alive."

Catherine smiled. Small. Tired. Real. "What are you today?"

The same question as yesterday. The same question that tasted like truth Elara wasn't ready to name.

"Your blacksmith," Elara said. Same answer as before. Still true. Still not the whole truth.

---

They spent the day not working on armor removal.

Catherine was restless. Seven years of constant motion, constant vigilance, constant duty. Sitting still felt wrong to her. Elara could see it in the way Catherine's hands clenched and unclenched, the way her eyes tracked movement, the way she startled at every sound.

"Walk with me," Elara said.

"Where?"

"Market. I need to pick up supplies."

"I can't go to the market. I'm a deserter. There are soldiers looking for me."

"So we'll be careful. Hat. Cloak. Keep your left arm covered." Elara pulled a heavy cloak from the wardrobe. "Your right arm is bare now. No one's looking for a partially-armored knight. They're looking for full plate."

Catherine hesitated. Then nodded.

They walked through Ironhearth at mid-morning. Catherine wore the cloak pulled tight, hood up, left arm hidden. Her right arm swung free—still weak, still learning balance, but human. Visible.

No one looked twice.

Elara bought leather for Catherine's custom boots. Bought cotton for more bandages. Bought fresh bread from the baker's stall because Catherine had admitted she hadn't tasted fresh bread in seven years.

"Here," Elara said, handing her a piece.

Catherine took it. Stared at it like it was a foreign object.

"You're supposed to eat it," Elara said.

"I know. I'm—" Catherine stopped. "Everything tastes different now. Stronger. I can taste salt and yeast and something sweet. Before the armor, food was bland. The binding suppressed sensation."

"And now?"

"Now it's overwhelming." Catherine took a small bite. Chewed slowly. Her eyes closed. "That's—that's good."

"It's bread."

"It's perfect bread."

Elara watched her eat. Watched the way Catherine savored each bite like it was revelation. Watched the way her throat worked when she swallowed. Watched the exact moment Catherine realized she was being watched and looked up, catching Elara staring.

"What?" Catherine asked.

"Nothing."

"You're counting again."

"I'm always counting."

"What's the count this time?"

Seventeen seconds between bites. Four chews per bite. Three visible freckles on Catherine's hand holding the bread. The same three freckles from the first day—Ursa Minor constellation, permanent and specific.

"Doesn't matter," Elara said.

They walked back to the forge slowly. Catherine was limping again—the blisters on her heel hadn't fully healed, and the uneven armor weight was still affecting her gait. Elara made a mental note: Finish the boots tonight. Priority.

Back at the forge, Catherine sat by the fire. Not working. learning to sit still. Learning that rest wasn't weakness.

Elara worked on the boots. Cutting leather, measuring against Catherine's foot dimensions (twenty-three centimeters long, eight centimeters wide at widest point, high arch). The work was familiar. Comforting. Her hands knew what to do even while her mind was elsewhere.

"Can I ask you something?" Catherine said.

"Always."

"Why are you doing this? All of it. The armor removal, the harboring a deserter, the—" She gestured vaguely. "—everything. You could have said no. Should have said no. Why didn't you?"

Elara's hands stilled on the leather. Good question. Dangerous question.

"Because the armor was screaming," she said. "And no one else could hear it."

"That's not a reason to risk execution for treason."

"Isn't it?"

"Elara."

"Catherine." Elara met her eyes. "I don't know how to explain it. The first time you walked into this forge, the armor screaming and I knew—" She stopped. Tried again. "that if I didn't help, you'd die. And the thought of you dying felt wrong. Felt like watching my mother burn all over again. Felt like failure I couldn't accept."

"So this is about your mother?"

"No. This is about you." Elara set down the leather. "It started as guilt. As trying to save someone because I couldn't save her. But it's not that anymore."

"What is it now?"

The truth tasted like metal and warmth and the exact temperature at which professional distance became wanting. The truth was dangerous. The truth could change everything.

"I don't know yet," Elara said. Half-truth. "Still figuring it out."

Catherine was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Me too."

They worked in comfortable silence. Elara on boots. Catherine watching the fire, learning to sit still, learning to want rest.

The bell chimed three times. Three in the afternoon.

"Shoulder armor," Elara said. "We should remove it today if you're feeling up to it."

"you said one day of rest."

"One day of no chest work. Shoulders are different. Less intensive. We can do both pauldrons in a few hours."

Catherine stood. "Let's do it."

The shoulder armor came off easier than expected. The threads were shallow here—woven into muscle but not bone, anchored to tissue but not organs. Elara worked methodically. Left shoulder first. Forty-three minutes. Right shoulder second. Thirty-eight minutes.

When both pieces came away, Catherine did something Elara had never seen her do.

She raised both arms above her head.

Both of them. Right and left. Bare and free. Reaching toward the ceiling like she was testing whether the world would let her.

Then she spun.

spun in a circle, arms extended, laughing. The sound was different from before—not rusty, not short. Full. Joy.

"I can move," Catherine said, still spinning. "I can move freely. No weight. No restriction. I can—"

She stopped. Dropped her arms. Stared at them like they belonged to someone else.

"Seven years," she said quietly. "Seven years since I could do that."

Elara's throat was tight. "How does it feel?"

"Terrifying. Perfect. Like learning to fly and falling at the same time."

Catherine flexed her fingers. Both hands. Curled them into fists, released, curled again. Testing. Relearning. She looked at Elara.

"Thank you," she said. "For this. For all of it."

"You've thanked me seventeen times in two weeks. You don't need to keep thanking me."

"I know. But I don't know what else to say." Catherine crossed the distance between them. Slowly. Deliberately. Stopped an arm's length away. "How do people do this?"

"Do what?"

"Show gratitude. Show—" Catherine's hands flexed again. "I want to thank you properly. But I don't know how. Seven years of armor means seven years of no physical contact. No hugs. No handshakes. No casual touch. I don't remember how to be human like this."

Elara's heart was doing something erratic. "You want to touch me?"

"I want to not be afraid of touching you. There's a difference."

"What are you afraid of?"

"Doing it wrong. Wanting too much. Crossing a line I can't uncross."

"Catherine." Elara held out her right hand. Palm up. An offering. "There's no wrong way. if you want to touch me, then touch me. I won't break."

Catherine stared at Elara's hand. At the forty-three burn scars on her fingers and palm. At the calluses from hammer work. At the proof that Elara was human, breakable, real.

Then she placed her hand in Elara's.

Skin to skin. Palm to palm. Catherine's hand was warmer now. 35°C or maybe 36°C. Warming every day.

She didn't pull away.

Neither did they speak.

They stood there, hands clasped, for seconds that became minutes. Elara counted without meaning to. Fifteen seconds. Thirty. Sixty.

At one hundred twenty seconds—two full minutes—Catherine's thumb moved. Traced across Elara's knuckles. Slow. Careful. Like she was memorizing the texture.

"Your hands are so warm," Catherine said.

"Forge heat. I'm always warm."

"I know. It's—" Catherine stopped. "Nice. Feeling temperature differences. Feeling skin that isn't my own. Feeling human."

Three hundred seconds. Five minutes.

Elara's palm was starting to sweat. She didn't move.

Six hundred seconds. Ten minutes.

"We should probably let go," Catherine said.

"Probably."

Neither moved.

Nine hundred seconds. Fifteen minutes.

"Catherine?"

"Yes?"

"I'm going to say something. And you can say no. But I need to say it anyway."

Catherine's hand tightened in hers. "Say it."

Elara took a breath. Counted to five. Spoke the truth that had been building for fourteen days.

"Can I kiss you?"

Catherine's hand went still. Her eyes widened.

Elara rushed to continue. "You can say no. You should say no. This is a terrible idea. You're recovering from major surgery. You're a fugitive. I'm harboring you. The power dynamic is completely wrong. There are a thousand reasons this shouldn't happen. But I—" She stopped. "I wanted to ask anyway. So you'd know. So it would be your choice."

Catherine didn't speak.

Elara started to pull her hand back.

Catherine held on.

"Not yet," Catherine said quietly. "Ask me again soon. But not yet. I need—" She stopped. "I need to be more human first. Need to remember what wanting feels like when it's not tangled up in desperation and gratitude and fear. I need to know that when I say yes, it's because I want you. Not because you saved me."

Elara nodded. "Okay."

"That's not a no."

"I know."

"It's a soon."

"I know."

Catherine smiled. Small. Shy. The expression of someone learning what hope felt like. "Thank you for asking."

"Thank you for being honest."

They let go.

The space between their hands felt vast.

Elara turned back to the workbench. Catherine sat by the fire. They didn't speak for the rest of the evening.

But when Catherine went upstairs to sleep, Elara counted the floorboards under her bed one more time. Forty-seven. Same as always.

And thought: *Soon.*
