# Chapter 5

The commander arrived on day ten.

Elara was working the bellows when the horses—three of them, armor-weighted, military cadence. She looked up from the forge to see them stop outside. Two soldiers in Eldergard silver flanking a third rider whose armor made Catherine's look simple.

Full plate. Ornate. The kind that cost more than Elara's forge.

Commander rank insignia on the pauldrons.

Catherine's superior.

Elara's hands stilled on the bellows handle.

The commander dismounted. Didn't knock. Walked straight into the forge like she owned it. The two soldiers stayed outside—guards, not participants.

"Dame Catherine Valois," the commander said. Not a question. A summons.

Catherine appeared from the back room where she'd been resting between thread removal sessions. She'd removed her right arm armor permanently now, but the rest remained—chest, back, left arm, legs. The imbalance was visible. Right side human, left side metal.

She stood at attention immediately. Military reflex. Seven years of training overriding eight days of relearning humanity.

"Commander Ashford," Catherine said.

"You were due to report three days ago."

"My situation has changed."

"Explain."

Catherine's jaw tightened. Elara could see the calculation happening—truth versus duty, survival versus obligation, Mara's ghost versus the woman she was becoming.

"The armor removal process has proven more complex than anticipated," Catherine said. Each word careful. Precise. The voice of someone who'd learned that one wrong word could mean court-martial. "I require additional time to complete it safely."

"How much additional time?"

"Four weeks. Minimum."

Commander Ashford's expression didn't change. "Unacceptable. The peace negotiations conclude in eight days. You are required to attend the final sessions. Your presence was specifically requested by both councils."

"I cannot attend in my current condition."

"Then you will re-seal the armor temporarily and attend anyway."

Re-seal. The word landed like a hammer strike.

Elara stepped forward. "That would undo weeks of work. The threads have already been partially severed. Re-sealing could cause permanent damage to the integration points."

Commander Ashford looked at her for the first time. "And you are?"

"Elara Thorne. Blacksmith. I'm performing the removal."

"Your credentials?"

"Eight years of master-level metalwork. Specialist in magic-alloy integration."

It was a lie. Elara had never worked with magic alloys before Catherine. But her voice didn't waver, and sometimes confidence sold better than truth.

Commander Ashford studied her. Then turned back to Catherine. "Is this accurate?"

Catherine met Elara's eyes. A moment of silent communication: *Trust me. Please.*

"Yes," Catherine said. "Thorne is the most qualified smith in three kingdoms for this work. Re-sealing the armor would jeopardize the entire removal process."

"Then you should have considered that before beginning removal during active diplomatic service." Commander Ashford's voice was cold. Not cruel. factual. "Your duty takes precedence over personal medical concerns."

"This isn't personal medical concern. This is survival. The armor is killing me."

"All bindings carry risk. You accepted that risk when you volunteered."

"I was nineteen."

"Old enough to swear oaths."

Catherine's hand—the bare one—curled into a fist. "I understand my obligations, Commander. But I cannot fulfill them dead."

"You cannot fulfill them hiding in a civilian forge either." Commander Ashford stepped closer. Her voice lowered. Not gentle, but quieter. "Catherine. I know what the binding costs. I wore one for twelve years before I earned release. But you don't earn release by running. You earn it by completing your service with honor."

"I'm not running. I'm trying to live long enough to complete my service."

"By whose assessment do you have weeks to live?"

"Mine." Catherine's voice was steady. "And Thorne's."

"Medical assessment requires three certified healers minimum for a binding release petition. You have one blacksmith and your own opinion. That's not sufficient grounds for service interruption."

"I'm not requesting service interruption. I'm requesting medical leave."

"Denied. You will re-seal the armor, attend the negotiations, and complete your medical leave after diplomatic obligations are fulfilled."

"That will take three weeks minimum. I don't have three weeks."

"Then you should have planned better." Commander Ashford turned toward the door. "You have until tonight to re-seal. Report to the Eldergard embassy at dawn tomorrow. That's an order, Dame Valois."

She left. The two soldiers followed. Hoofbeats faded down Silver Street.

Silence.

Catherine stood at attention for fifteen seconds after they'd gone. Then her knees gave out.

Elara caught her. Again. This was becoming pattern—Catherine collapsing, Elara preventing the fall. Role reversal of the soldier and the civilian.

"I have to go," Catherine said into Elara's shoulder.

"You don't."

"It's a direct order."

"So disobey it."

"I can't."

"You can. You're human. Humans disobey orders when the orders will kill them."

Catherine pulled back. Her face was pale. Paler than usual. The 34°C warmth they'd fought for looked like it was draining away in real-time.

"If I disobey, I'm a deserter. They'll hunt me. Find me. Execute me for treason."

"If you obey, you're dead anyway. The armor will kill you before the three weeks are done."

"At least I'll die with honor."

"Honor doesn't keep you warm. Honor doesn't count your heartbeats. Honor is a word people use to make dying young sound noble." Elara's hands were shaking. When had they started shaking? She didn't shake. Shaking meant losing control. "You have a choice, Catherine. You can die perfect in three weeks, or you can live imperfect for decades. Choose."

Catherine's throat worked. "It's not that simple."

"It is exactly that simple."

"You don't understand duty."

"I understand being so afraid of failing again that you'd die than risk being human." Elara stepped back. Created distance. "You told me about Mara. About the binding. About choosing perfection because human-you let her die. But you know what? Mara would probably have her sister alive and imperfect than dead and perfect."

"You didn't know her."

"I know you. And you're worth saving. Even if you don't believe that yet."

They stared at each other. Summer-moss eyes versus forge-dark eyes. Knight versus blacksmith. Duty versus survival.

"I don't know how to disobey," Catherine said quietly.

"Yes you do. You've been doing it for eight days. Every time you come here instead of reporting to your commander. Every time you let me cut another thread. Every time you choose living over perfection." Elara picked up Catherine's right gauntlet—the one they'd removed on day one. "This is disobedience. You haven't named it yet."

Catherine looked at the gauntlet. "If I don't report tomorrow, they'll come for me."

"Then we have tonight to remove as much as possible."

"We can't remove enough in one night."

"We can remove the chest piece."

Catherine blinked. "That's the most dangerous section. The threads are wrapped around my ribs. One mistake and—"

"One mistake and you die. I know. But you're dying anyway if you go back. So we take the risk now instead of slowly." Elara met her eyes. "Unless you want to re-seal. In which case I'll help you do that instead. Your choice."

The church bell tolled. Three times. Three o'clock in the afternoon. Nine hours until midnight. Fifteen hours until Catherine was supposed to report to the embassy.

Catherine picked up the gauntlet. Felt its weight. Set it down again.

"If I do this," she said slowly, "if I disobey direct orders and stay for removal, I can never go back. They'll mark me deserter. Strip my titles. Execute me if they catch me. I'll be a traitor to Eldergard."

"Yes."

"I'll lose everything. My rank. My honor. My home."

"Yes."

"I'll be alone."

"No." Elara's voice was steady. "You'll be alive. And you won't be alone."

Catherine's eyes snapped to hers. "What does that mean?"

The truth tasted like metal and warmth and the exact temperature at which professional distance became something else. The truth was: *I'm falling for you and I'd have you alive and here than dead and honorable.*

"It means I'm not letting you die because some commander values politics over people," Elara said. "If you stay, you stay here. In Ironhearth. We'll finish the removal. Figure out the rest after."

"They'll come for me."

"Let them."

"Elara, you don't understand. Eldergard doesn't forgive desertion. They'll send soldiers. Hunters. They'll destroy everything you have to get to me."

"Then we'll deal with that when it happens. But you'll be alive to see it." Elara picked up her thread-cutting tools. Began arranging them with the precision of ritual. "Chest piece removal. Tonight. Yes or no?"

Catherine was quiet for a long time.

Then: "Yes."

---

Catherine left at four o'clock.

"I need to retrieve some things from the embassy," she said. "Personal effects. Letters. And I need to—" She stopped. Started again. "I need to write to my father. Tell him I'm staying. That I'm choosing this."

"Will he understand?"

"No. But he deserves to know anyway."

She was gone for three hours. Elara spent them preparing—laying out tools, sketching the chest piece mechanism, reviewing her notes on thread placement around vital organs. The chest piece was the most complex armor section. Forty-seven separate articulation points. Threads woven through ribs, around lungs, into the tissue surrounding Catherine's heart.

One wrong cut and Catherine would bleed internally. Or stop breathing. Or her heart would seize.

The stakes had never been higher.

Elara counted tools. Twelve probes. Six cutting implements. Three different sizes of thread-extraction needles. One hundred seventeen cotton swabs. Four rolls of bandages.

Counted heartbeats. Hers were raise. Ninety-two per minute. Thirty beats faster than normal.

Fear. She was afraid.

Not of the work. She trusted her hands. But of what failure would mean. Of Catherine dying on her anvil instead of in armor. Of trying to save someone and losing them anyway.

The bell above the door chimed.

Seven o'clock. Catherine was back.

She looked different. No—she looked the same, but she carried herself differently. Shoulders back. Head high. The posture of someone who'd made a decision and wouldn't be argued out of it.

"I wrote the letter," Catherine said. "Left it at the embassy. By dawn they'll know I'm not reporting."

"Any regrets?"

"Hundreds. But none of them stronger than wanting to live."

Elara nodded. "Lie down. This is going to take hours."

Catherine stripped the chest piece. It came off in sections—breastplate, backplate, side panels, articulation plates. Each piece connected to the next through magic threading. Each piece fused to Catherine's skin at seventeen different points.

When the last plate came away, Catherine's torso was revealed.

Elara had seen sketches. Had theorized. Had mapped the threading based on Catherine's descriptions of pain.

Theory wasn't preparation.

Catherine's ribs were visible. Not because she was thin—though she was, seven years of not eating properly had carved her hollow—but because the skin was translucent. Silver threads ran between each rib like surgical sutures. Wrapped around her lungs in a cage pattern. Converged over her heart in a knot so complex it looked like lacework.

Beautiful. Terrible. The magic that required sacrificing humanity to achieve perfection.

"How bad?" Catherine asked. She wasn't looking. Couldn't look.

"Complex," Elara said. Honest but not cruel. "Worse than your arm. But manageable."

"Can you remove it in one night?"

"No. But I can remove enough that re-sealing becomes impossible."

"How much is enough?"

"The heart threads. If I can cut those, your heart can start healing. The rest we can do over weeks."

Catherine's breathing was shallow. Fear or pain or both. "The heart threads are the deepest. Most integrated."

"I know."

"If you cut wrong—"

"I won't."

"You can't promise that."

"I can promise I'll try. That's all anyone can promise."

Catherine closed her eyes. "Do it."

Elara worked.

The first thread took forty minutes. It was wrapped around Catherine's lowest right rib, threaded through the intercostal muscle, anchored to the pleura surrounding her lung. Removing it required precision measured in fractions of millimeters. Required not breathing, not blinking, not thinking about anything except the microscopic gap between silver and tissue.

Catherine made sounds. Not screams. Worse than screams. The subvocal noises of someone who'd learned that noise didn't help but couldn't stay silent.

Second thread. Third. Fourth.

Hours passed. Elara's hands were steady despite her heart doing something erratic. Despite sweat running down her back despite the forge being banked low. Despite the knowledge that one mistake would kill the woman she was—

The woman she was trying to save.

That's all. Professional. Clinical.

Midnight came and went.

Catherine had stopped making sounds. Had gone silent in the way that meant either deep meditation or barely conscious. Elara checked her pulse every fifteen minutes. Still beating. 61 per minute. One beat slower than before, but still regular.

By two in the morning, Elara had removed twelve threads from Catherine's ribcage. Twelve out of hundreds. But twelve critical ones—the ones that had been constricting Catherine's lungs, making every breath a battle against silver.

"How do you feel?" Elara asked.

Catherine took a breath. Deep. Deeper than Elara had seen her breathe before.

"I can breathe," Catherine said. Wonder in her voice. "Fully. For the first time in seven years, I can breathe all the way down."

Elara's throat was tight. "Good. That's good."

"Keep going."

"You need rest."

"I need you to cut the heart threads before dawn. Before they realize I'm not coming and send soldiers."

"Catherine—"

"Please." Catherine opened her eyes. Summer-moss green in the low forge light. "I chose this. I chose you. Don't make me regret it by stopping now."

Elara counted to ten. Breathed. Tried to remember that stopping was the smart thing, the safe thing, the thing that kept Catherine alive past dawn.

Then she picked up the next probe.

"Heart threads," she said. "Don't move. Don't even breathe deeply."

The heart threads were worse than anything before. They were woven directly into the pericardium—the sac surrounding Catherine's heart. Removing them required cutting between heartbeats. Required rhythm. Required trusting Catherine's heart to keep beating despite Elara slicing away the silver that had supported it for seven years.

First heart thread: Cut between beats seventy-two and seventy-three. Clean separation. Catherine gasped.

"Still beating?" Elara asked.

"Still beating."

Second heart thread: Cut between beats eighty-nine and ninety. Slight fumble. The thread clung. Elara had to tease it away. Catherine's hand gripped the edge of the worktable hard enough that the wood cracked.

"Still beating?" Elara asked.

"Yes."

Third heart thread: Cut between beats one hundred twelve and one hundred thirteen. Perfect. Catherine made no sound.

"Catherine?"

"Still here. Keep going."

Elara cut. Fourth thread. Fifth. Sixth.

The bell tower chimed four times. Four in the morning. Two hours until dawn.

Elara had removed nine of the seventeen heart threads. Nine. Catherine was breathing easier. Color returning to her face. Warmth spreading.

"Temperature check," Elara said.

She pressed her hand to Catherine's chest—directly over her heart, over the exposed skin between half-removed silver threads. The skin was warm. 35°C. One degree warmer than yesterday.

Catherine's heart beat against Elara's palm. Faster now. 74 beats per minute. Faster than the controlled 62. Faster meant healing. Meant Catherine's heart was remembering how to race, how to panic, how to feel.

"You're warming up," Elara said.

"I know." Catherine's voice was rough. "I can feel it. Your hand. The warmth. I can feel everything."

Elara should move her hand. Should create distance. Should remember that this was professional, clinical, a temperature check.

She didn't move.

Catherine's hand—the bare right one—came up. Covered Elara's hand against her chest.

"Thank you," Catherine said. "For this. For believing I was worth saving."

"You are worth saving."

"How do you know?"

"Because you're here. Because you chose to live. Because—" Elara stopped. The truth tasted like metal and warmth and the exact temperature of Catherine's skin under her hands. The truth was too big for this moment, too complicated, too dangerous.

"Because?" Catherine prompted.

"Because anyone who fights this hard to be human instead of perfect deserves a chance to see what being human feels like."

Catherine's thumb traced across Elara's knuckles. "What does it feel like?"

"I don't know. You tell me."

"Warm." Catherine's eyes were closed. "Terrifying. Like standing at the edge of a cliff and being told to jump. Like everything hurts and everything matters and I don't know how people live like this without armor but I think—" She stopped. "I think I want to try."

The church bell chimed five times.

One hour until dawn.

Elara pulled back. "Eight more threads. We need to finish before they come."

They worked in silence. Eighth thread. Ninth. Tenth.

The eleventh thread was the hardest. Wrapped directly around Catherine's left coronary artery. One wrong move and Catherine would have a heart attack on the table.

Elara's hands were shaking.

She stopped. Counted to twenty. Breathed. Began again.

The thread came away clean.

Catherine exhaled. "Still beating."

"Four more."

Twelfth. Thirteenth. Fourteenth.

The bell chimed six times.

Dawn.

Catherine was supposed to be at the embassy right now. Supposed to be reporting for duty. Instead she was on Elara's worktable with her chest carved open and her heart half-freed.

Deserter. Traitor. Oathbreaker.

Alive.

"Three more," Elara said.

Fifteenth thread. Sixteenth.

The seventeenth thread was the central one. The thread that all the others had anchored to. The thread that ran from Catherine's sternum to her spine, through her heart, connecting front armor to back.

The lynchpin.

"This is the last one," Elara said. "Once it's gone, the chest piece can't be re-sealed. You'll be committed. Understand?"

"I understand."

"No going back."

"I know."

"Catherine. Look at me."

Catherine opened her eyes.

"Once I cut this," Elara said, "you're a deserter officially. No second chances. No negotiation. They'll hunt you. Hunt me for helping you. Are you certain?"

Catherine smiled. Small. Sad. Free. "I'm certain. Cut it."

Elara cut.

The thread resisted. Clung. Had to be severed in three places—sternum, heart, spine. Each cut requiring precision. Each cut permanent.

When the last section came away, Catherine gasped.

Not pain. Not fear.

Relief.

"It's gone," Catherine said. "I can feel it. The weight. The pressure. It's gone."

Elara set the final thread aside. Seventeen heart threads in a glass vial. Evidence of Catherine's choice. Of her freedom.

"How's your heart?" Elara asked.

Catherine pressed her hand to her chest. "Beating. Fast. Is that normal?"

"That's human."

"Then yes. It's beating."

They looked at each other. Blacksmith and deserter. Civilian and former knight. Two women who'd chosen each other over duty.

"What happens now?" Catherine asked.

"Now I bandage you. You rest. We figure out tomorrow when tomorrow comes."

"And when the soldiers arrive?"

"We deal with them."

"How?"

"I don't know yet. But we'll find a way." Elara began cleaning the wounds. Cotton swabs, steady hands, trying not to notice how Catherine's skin felt under her fingers, how her heartbeat was visible through translucent skin, how close they were. "You're not alone in this."

"I should be. You didn't sign up for harboring a deserter."

"I signed up for keeping you alive. The politics are complications."

"Complications that could get you killed."

"Then we'll be dead together. More poetic that way."

Catherine laughed. Rusty. Short. Real. "You have terrible survival instincts."

"Says the woman who chose desertion over dying slowly."

"Fair point."

Elara finished bandaging. Wrapped Catherine's torso in clean cotton—not too tight, enough to protect the wounds. Catherine's breathing was easier now. Deeper. Fuller.

"Sleep," Elara said. "You need to heal."

"Where?"

"My room. Upstairs. You can't go back to the embassy."

"Your father—"

"Is at the market until noon. He won't know. And if he finds out, I'll handle it."

Catherine stood. Swayed. Elara caught her—again, always catching her—and helped her to the stairs.

Her room was small. Fourteen feet square. One window facing east. One bed that Elara had counted the floorboards under (forty-seven).

Catherine collapsed onto the bed. Asleep before her head hit the pillow.

Elara stood in the doorway watching her breathe. Counting breaths. Thirty-seven per minute. Fast but regular. Human.

Alive.

She closed the door quietly. Went back to the forge.

The chest piece armor sat on her workbench. Disassembled. Permanent. No going back.

Elara picked up the seventeen heart threads. Felt their weight.

Light. So light. Barely there.

Such small things to have nearly killed someone.

She set them in the vial with the others. Sixty-one threads total now. Hundreds more remaining.

But Catherine could breathe. Could feel. Could choose.

That had to be enough.
