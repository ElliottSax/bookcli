# Chapter 12

Catherine's fever started on day twenty-three.

Not infection. Worse. The armor removal had accelerated to the point where her body couldn't adapt fast enough—couldn't remember how to regulate temperature, how to generate heat without silver threads stealing it away. Her core oscillated: 31°C one hour, 34° the next, back down to 30°.

Dangerous. Potentially fatal.

Elara kept her in the room above the forge. Piled blankets (seven of them, she counted). Fed the fire until the room was stifling. Watched Catherine shiver under all that wool and still look cold.

"I'm fine," Catherine said for the fortieth time. Her teeth were chattering.

"You're 30 degrees and dropping."

"That's my normal."

"Your normal is killing you."

Catherine tried to sit up. Failed. Fell back against pillows that Elara had fluffed three times in the last hour because she needed something to do with her hands besides count Catherine's too-slow heartbeats.

55 per minute now. Bradycardia. Catherine's heart was giving up.

"How much armor is left?" Catherine asked.

"Both feet. That's it."

"So close."

"Two days. Maybe three if we're careful."

"I don't have three days." Catherine's voice was matter-of-fact. Soldier's voice. The voice of someone assessing tactical reality. "My heart's failing. You can feel it."

Elara could. She'd been holding Catherine's wrist for the past hour, counting pulse, feeling it weaken. 55. 54. 53.

"I'm going to finish this," Elara said.

"Even if I die before you do?"

"You're not going to die."

"Elara—"

"I won't let you."

Catherine smiled. It was small. Sad. The smile of someone who'd stopped believing in miracles but loved that someone else still did. "You can't control this."

"Watch me."

Elara stood. Crossed to her workbench. Started mixing—crushed herbs from the apothecary, alcohol, a tincture that was supposed to help with hypothermia. Her hands were shaking again. Fear-shaking. The same shake from three years ago when her father had told her *some fires you can't put out, girl.*

She'd put out every fire since.

She would put out this one too.

Behind her, Catherine made a sound.

Elara turned.

Catherine had pushed the blankets off. Was sitting up despite the shaking. Despite the way her whole body was trembling with effort.

"What are you doing?" Elara asked.

"Come here."

"You need to rest."

"I need you to come here."

Elara crossed the room. Stopped at the edge of the bed—old bed, her mother's bed, the frame she'd inherited along with the forge and the guilt. Catherine was shivering hard enough that the bed frame creaked.

"You're freezing," Elara said.

"I know."

"The blankets—"

"Aren't helping. They're just—" Catherine gestured vaguely. "Wool. I need—"

She stopped. Looked at Elara. Those summer-moss eyes were glassy with fever but still focused. Still *there.*

"What do you need?" Elara asked quietly.

"You."

Silence.

The forge crackled downstairs. Outside, rain started—spring rain, the kind that turned Ironhearth's streets to mud and made metalwork rust overnight. The church bell tolled nine times. Night. The hour when honesty came easier.

"Catherine—"

"I'm cold," Catherine said. Simple. Direct. "I've been cold for seven years. And the blankets don't help. And the fire doesn't help. But when you touch me—" She stopped. Swallowed. "When you touch me, I feel warm. Just for a moment. Just where your skin meets mine. And I—I need that. Please."

Elara's throat was tight.

She'd been touching Catherine for three weeks. Clinical touches. Professional touches. Hands on wrists to check pulse. Fingers on ribs to trace threads. Palm to forehead to gauge fever. Every touch cataloged, counted, measured.

This was different.

This was Catherine asking to be held.

"I don't want to hurt you," Elara said.

"You won't."

"The threads are still in your legs. If I press wrong—"

"Then I'll tell you." Catherine held out her hand. It was shaking. "Please. I'm—I'm asking."

Elara took Catherine's hand. Counted: 2.1 seconds before Catherine's fingers wrapped around hers. Counted: 4 heartbeats before Catherine pulled her closer. Counted: 7 breaths before Elara was sitting on the edge of the bed.

"Lie down," Catherine said.

"You're sick."

"I'm always sick. Lie down anyway."

Elara did. Carefully. On top of the blankets, not under them, maintaining some distance even though Catherine was looking at her like distance was the last thing either of them needed.

Catherine shifted closer. Pressed her face against Elara's shoulder. Her whole body was shaking—cold-shaking, want-shaking, seven-years-of-not-being-held shaking.

Elara wrapped her arms around her.

Catherine made a sound—half sob, half sigh. The sound of someone who'd forgotten what comfort felt like and was remembering in pieces.

"You're so warm," Catherine whispered into Elara's neck.

"You're so cold."

"I know."

They lay there. Elara counted Catherine's heartbeats against her chest. Still too slow. 54. 53. But steady. Still fighting.

She counted her own heartbeats too. 92. 94. Racing like her heart knew what her head was trying not to think: *This might be the last time. If Catherine's heart gives out tonight. If the fever spikes. If the threads in her legs poison her faster than Elara can remove them.*

*This might be the last time.*

"What are you thinking?" Catherine asked.

"That I don't want to lose you."

"You barely know me."

"I know you count your breaths when you're in pain. I know you're left-handed but the armor made you fight right-handed for seven years. I know you have three freckles on your right hand in Ursa Minor pattern. I know you haven't cried in front of another person since you were nineteen. I know you volunteered for the binding because your sister died and you thought becoming perfect would mean you could protect everyone. I know you're terrified of wanting things because wanting means you're still human enough to be hurt."

Elara's voice cracked. "I know you. And I don't want to lose you."

Catherine pulled back just enough to see Elara's face. Her eyes were swimming. "You're crying."

"So are you."

"I cry all the time now. You did that. Gave me back tears."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be." Catherine's hand came up. Cupped Elara's face with those too-cold fingers. "I forgot I could feel this much. Forgot wanting someone could hurt and be beautiful at the same time."

"Does it hurt?"

"Yes."

"Should I stop?"

"God, no."

Catherine leaned in.

The kiss was different from the first one. That kiss had been desperate, urgent, seven years of starvation. This kiss was—

Slow.

Careful.

*Tender.*

Catherine kissed like someone learning a new language. Tentative at first, then braver. Her lips were cold but her breath was warm. Her hand was shaking against Elara's face but her fingers were sure.

Elara kissed back. Counted: 12 seconds before Catherine's tongue touched her lip (asking). Counted: 3 heartbeats before Elara opened her mouth (answering). Counted: the moment she stopped counting because there were some things mathematics couldn't measure.

Catherine's free hand slid to Elara's waist. Pulled her closer. There were still blankets between them but less space, less distance, less *separation.*

Elara's hands found Catherine's ribs. The silver-laced ribs she'd memorized by now—47 major threads in Fibonacci spirals, 8 ribs on each side, the space between where Catherine's heart beat too slow.

She traced them. Gentle. Catherine gasped into her mouth.

"Too much?" Elara pulled back.

"No. Not enough. I—" Catherine's eyes were dark. Pupils blown. "I haven't been touched in seven years. Not like this. Not—" She stopped. Tried again. "I don't remember how this works."

"We don't have to—"

"I want to." Catherine's voice was rough. "I'm going to die in a week and I want to know what it feels like to want someone and have them want me back. To be touched like I'm human instead of armor. To—" Her breath caught. "Please. Show me."

Elara's heart was racing. 120 beats per minute. 130. She counted because her heart was screaming at her to say yes, to give Catherine everything, to make her feel *alive* before—

No. Not thinking about before. Not thinking about deadlines or failing hearts or threads that still needed removing.

Just this. Just Catherine asking to be touched. Asking to feel human again.

"Are you sure?" Elara asked.

"I've never been more sure of anything."

Elara pushed Catherine gently back against the pillows. Catherine went willing, watching her with those summer-moss eyes that were glassy with fever and want in equal measure.

"Tell me if anything hurts," Elara said.

"It all hurts. Do it anyway."

Elara started with Catherine's hand. The right hand with three freckles and silver nails and skin so pale it looked translucent. She kissed each knuckle. Counted them (fourteen, there should be fourteen). Traced the veins visible under skin. Felt Catherine's pulse—54 beats per minute, steady, alive.

"You're counting," Catherine said. Her voice was breathless.

"Always."

"What are you counting?"

"Everything. Your heartbeat. Your freckles. The number of times you've said my name today (seventeen)."

"Is that too many?"

"It's perfect."

Elara kissed Catherine's wrist. The place where silver threads wrapped like bracelets, where magic met flesh and both of them shook. Kissed her way up Catherine's forearm—pale skin, visible tendons, muscle that had atrophied under armor.

Catherine was shaking harder.

"Cold?" Elara asked.

"No. Nervous."

"We can stop."

"If you stop I'll die from wanting."

Elara smiled against Catherine's skin. Continued. Elbow. Bicep. Shoulder. Every inch cataloged, measured, memorized. Every inch that Catherine had been forbidden from feeling for seven years.

She reached Catherine's collarbone. The silver threads were thick here, wrapped around the bone, diving toward her heart. Elara traced them with her tongue.

Catherine made a sound.

Not pain. Not quite. Something between gasp and moan and the particular noise people made when they'd forgotten their body could feel pleasure.

"Again," Catherine said.

"What?"

"Do that again."

Elara did. Traced the threads with her tongue, careful not to pull, just *taste.* Silver and magic and Catherine's skin all mixed together.

Catherine's hand fisted in Elara's hair.

"I can't—" Catherine's voice was wrecked. "This is too much. I can't process—everything is so loud."

"Loud how?"

"Sensation. All of it. Your mouth. Your hands. The blankets. My own heartbeat. I can feel *everything* and I haven't felt anything real in so long and I don't know if I'm going to cry or scream or—"

"Then cry. Or scream. Or both." Elara kissed her throat. "You're allowed to feel things."

Catherine did.

She cried through it—Elara's hands on her ribs, her stomach, her hips. Cried like someone whose body was remembering what gentleness felt like after seven years of armor. Cried like touch was healing and hurting simultaneously.

Elara kept going. Slow. Careful. Giving Catherine time to adjust, to breathe, to exist in her own skin without metal between her and the world.

At some point Catherine's hands found Elara's shirt. Started pulling.

"Can I?" Catherine asked.

"Yes."

The shirt came off. Then Elara's undershirt. Then they were skin-to-skin—Catherine's cold meeting Elara's warmth, silver threads against burn scars, both of them marked by the things that had tried to destroy them.

"You're beautiful," Catherine whispered. Her fingers traced Elara's scars. Eighteen burn marks on left arm, seven on right. "Every scar. Every mark. You're—"

"So are you."

And then there was no more talking.

Just touch. Just breathing. Just the sound of the rain outside and the forge crackling downstairs and Catherine gasping into Elara's mouth like air was new, like sensation was new, like *wanting* was something she was learning how to do.

Elara lost count.

Stopped counting heartbeats, stopped counting seconds, stopped counting anything except the number of times Catherine said her name (lost track at forty-three).

Catherine touched her like someone who'd forgotten how hands worked and was relearning through practice. Clumsy sometimes. Hesitant others. But always *there,* always present, always asking "Is this good? Can I—? Show me—?"

Elara showed her.

Showed her where to touch. How to touch. Showed her that bodies were meant to be soft, that vulnerability wasn't weakness, that wanting someone wasn't something to be ashamed of.

And Catherine learned fast.

Her hands found Elara's waist, her hips, the places that made Elara gasp and arch and forget every word except *yes* and *there* and *please.*

At some point they ended up tangled—legs intertwined, Catherine's silver-threaded leg wrapped around Elara's scarred thigh, both of them breathing hard.

"I think I'm warmer," Catherine said. Her face was flushed. Her eyes were bright. Her heart was racing—82 beats per minute, fastest Elara had ever counted.

"Your heart—"

"Is learning to race again. Because of you." Catherine kissed her. Soft this time. Sweet. "Teach me more."

So Elara did.

She taught Catherine how to ask for what she wanted. How to say *yes* and *more* and *there, just like that.* How to exist in pleasure without shame, in vulnerability without armor.

How to be human.

And Catherine taught her back.

Taught her that three years of loneliness could end in an instant. That want didn't have to be measured or counted or controlled. That sometimes the best thing you could forge wasn't metal but connection—the kind that burned brighter than any forge fire.

They fell asleep somewhere around midnight. Tangled together. Catherine's heart still too slow (68 per minute) but steadier. Her temperature still too cold (32°C) but rising.

Alive.

Still alive.

Elara held her and counted ceiling beams (fourteen) and tried not to think about the armor pieces waiting downstairs. About the deadline. About the way Catherine's heart still fought against silver threads with every beat.

Just this. Just Catherine warm in her arms. Just the rain outside and the forge fire dying and both of them breathing in sync.

Tomorrow they'd finish the armor removal.

Tomorrow they'd face whatever came after.

But tonight—tonight Catherine was alive and warm and *hers,* and that was enough.

Elara pressed her lips to Catherine's forehead. Counted her breaths (18 per minute, slow and steady).

And slept.
