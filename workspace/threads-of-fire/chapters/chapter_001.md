# Chapter 1

The armor arrived three hours before the woman wearing it.

Elara heard it from across the market square—a low, wrong singing that made her teeth ache. Not the clean ring of well-forged steel. Not even the sullen silence of iron that had been worked too hard, too fast. This was different.

This was screaming.

She counted to ten. Wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her wrist, careful to avoid the fresh burn from this morning's commission. The Blacksmith's Guild had warned her about the delegation from Argentum. *Silver-workers and spell-singers,* the message had said. *Don't trust them. Don't touch their work.*

Elara hadn't needed the warning. She'd been reading metal since she was eight years old—since the morning she'd woken up tasting her mother's favorite cooking pot, iron and memory and the exact temperature at which love became loss.

Fifteen hundred thirty-eight degrees Celsius, if you were measuring.

The armor's song grew louder.

Elara's hands stilled on the horseshoe she'd been shaping. Quarter-turn clockwise. Two strikes. Quarter-turn. The rhythm was prayer. The rhythm was breath. The rhythm was the only thing that kept her from hearing everything every piece of metal in Ironhearth wanted to tell her.

But this armor wouldn't shut up.

She set down her hammer. Rolled her shoulders—right shoulder caught, always did since the accident, since the morning the forge had eaten her mother and left Elara with scars on her arms like a map of all the ways fire could betray you. Eighteen burn marks. She'd counted them this morning, same as every morning. Some people counted prayers. Elara counted damage.

The market square was crowded for midweek. Farmers selling winter root vegetables. Cloth merchants hawking wool thick enough to survive the mountain cold. A girl selling candied nuts that smelled like her mother's kitchen used to smell, back when kitchens meant safety instead of the place where your whole world could end in smoke and—

Not thinking about that.

Not today.

Elara shook out her hands. Flexed her fingers—the left pinky didn't straighten all the way anymore, healed crooked after she'd broken it at seventeen, too stubborn to ask the bonesetter for help because that would mean admitting the forge had hurt her again. She pressed her thumb against the crooked joint. The small pain was grounding. Real. Better than the phantom heat that still lived in her scars some nights, years later, her body remembering burning.

The armor turned the corner onto Forge Street.

The crowd parted. Not dramatically—people didn't scatter like they did in the adventure stories her mother used to read aloud—but they moved. Casual steps backward. Eyes sliding away. The particular dance people did when they recognized danger but didn't want danger to recognize them looking.

Elara didn't move.

She watched.

The woman wearing the armor was tall. Taller than Elara, and Elara was used to looking most people in the eye or down. The armor covered her completely—full plate from neck to feet, silver worked with gold filigree in patterns that probably meant something to people who cared about aristocratic heraldry. The helmet was off. Probably hot in there. Probably suffocating.

The woman's face was—

Elara's breath caught.

Not beautiful. Wrong word. Striking. Sharp cheekbones that could've been carved from the same steel Elara worked every day. Jaw like an anvil edge. Eyes the color of summer moss, green enough to hurt. Auburn hair pulled back in a braid that had been perfect six hours ago and was now starting to fray at the temples, small wisps curling against sweat-damp skin.

The woman looked exhausted. The kind of exhaustion that lived in your bones. The kind that made you forget what not-tired felt like.

Elara knew that exhaustion. Had worn it like a second skin for three years after her mother died, when she'd tried to prove to the Guild—to her father—to herself—that she could run the forge alone. Could be enough. Could be worth the space she took up in the world.

The woman's eyes swept the market square. Assessing. Cataloging. The way someone looked when they were used to threats coming from any direction. When they'd been trained to see everyone as either ally or enemy, and hadn't met enough allies to change the math.

Those eyes landed on Elara.

Held.

The armor screamed louder.

Elara's gift had never been subtle. When metal wanted to talk, it *talked.* When iron had been forged with love, she could taste the smith's pride like honey on her tongue. When a blade had been made to kill, she could feel the intent like splinters under her nails.

But this—

This wasn't intent. This was agony.

The armor wasn't just poorly made. It was *wrong.* Wrong in the way bones were wrong when they healed crooked, when the body knit itself back together around damage and called the pain normal because normal was all it remembered.

The woman in the armor was walking toward her.

Elara's heart kicked against her ribs. Not fear. Not exactly. Recognition, maybe. The same feeling she got when she found iron ore in the mountains—the sense of something valuable buried under layers of stone, waiting to be discovered. Waiting to be freed.

The woman stopped three feet away. Close enough that Elara could see the silver wasn't pure silver. There was something else woven through it—threads of magic that moved like living things, like veins carrying blood instead of metal holding shape.

"You're the master smith." The woman's voice was low. Rough, like someone who'd spent days shouting orders across a battlefield. "Elara Thorne."

Not a question.

"And you're—" Elara had to stop. Clear her throat. Start again. "Dame Catherine Valois. Knight-captain of the Silver Order. Commander of the queen's guard. The one who's supposed to negotiate peace while your army sits on our border like a threat with manners."

Catherine's mouth twitched. Almost a smile. Not quite. "That's what the title says."

"Titles lie."

"So I've learned."

The armor sang between them. A wrong note that made Elara want to press her hands over her ears, except she knew that wouldn't help. The sound wasn't in her ears. It was in her bones. In the part of her that had never learned to separate metal from self, that had been married to the forge since before she had words for what the gift meant.

"Your armor," Elara said. Heard her voice coming out too rough, too raw. Forced herself to gentle it. "It's—"

"Dying," Catherine finished. "I know."

"It's not dying. It's *hurting.*"

Catherine's eyes narrowed. "Armor doesn't hurt."

"This armor does."

For a long moment, Catherine just looked at her. Those moss-green eyes searching Elara's face for—what? Lies? Truth? Mockery?

Elara had gotten used to people not believing her. The gift wasn't common. Most smiths worked metal without hearing it sing, without tasting its history in their back teeth, without feeling its truth like a second heartbeat. Most smiths made horseshoes and cooking pots and weapons without ever knowing what the metal *wanted.*

Elara had never been most smiths.

"The Guild said you could help." Catherine's voice was carefully neutral. The kind of neutral that meant she'd been ordered to ask for help and hated every moment of it. "They said you read metal. That you can see things other smiths can't."

"I can."

"Can you fix it?"

Elara looked at the armor. Really looked. Let her gift unfold the way she'd been taught not to in public—the way that made her pupils dilate and her hands shake and her breathing go shallow because there was too much *information,* too many stories trying to tell themselves all at once.

The armor had been forged in agony. Had been *bound* to Catherine through a ritual that should've killed her. The silver threads weren't decorative. They were roots. Growing into Catherine's skin. Into her bones. Drinking her warmth. Replacing her humanity with something cold and perfect and *wrong.*

Elara pulled her gift back. Gasped. Tasted copper.

"No," she said.

Catherine went very still. "No, you can't help. Or no, you won't."

"No, I can't *fix it.* You don't fix something like this. You—" Elara stopped. Started again. "Who did this to you?"

"The queen's ritual-smiths. Seven years ago. I was nineteen. I volunteered."

"For what?"

"To become the perfect knight." Catherine's voice was flat. Empty. The way people sounded when they'd told a story so many times it didn't mean anything anymore. "The armor was supposed to make me stronger. Faster. Tireless. Unable to fail."

"And did it?"

"Yes."

Elara waited.

Catherine looked away. "I haven't slept in seven years. Haven't felt warm. Haven't—" She stopped. Clenched her jaw. "It did what they promised."

"And now?"

"Now it's poisoning me." Catherine met Elara's eyes again. "I have three months. Maybe four. The ritual-smiths say there's nothing to be done. The binding was meant to be permanent."

"But you came here anyway."

"The Guild said you were the best. That if anyone could find a way to remove it, you could." Catherine's voice was steady. Soldiers' voices always were, even when they were asking for miracles. "So. Can you?"

Elara should say no. Should send Catherine back to Argentum and their spell-singers and their silver-working aristocrats who thought you could forge a person the same way you forged a blade—with enough heat and pressure and complete disregard for what the metal actually wanted.

She should say no.

But the armor was screaming.

And Catherine's eyes were the color of summer moss, and summer moss meant the mountains above Ironhearth, meant the place Elara went when the forge got too loud and she needed to remember that the world was bigger than fire and loss.

"Take off your gauntlet," Elara said.

Catherine blinked. "What?"

"Your right gauntlet. Take it off."

"I can't."

"Can't, or won't?"

"Can't." Catherine's jaw was tight. "The armor doesn't come off. That's the binding. It's fused to—" She stopped. Closed her eyes. Opened them. "It doesn't come off."

Elara held out her hand. "Let me try."

"You can't—"

"I read metal for a living. I've been doing this since I was eight years old. Let me try."

For a moment, Catherine didn't move. Then, slowly, she extended her right arm.

Elara stepped closer. Close enough to smell Catherine—sweat and steel and something else, something cold like winter air or deep cave darkness or the space between stars. Close enough to see the fine lines around Catherine's eyes, the kind you got from seven years of not sleeping, of holding yourself together through pure will when your body wanted to collapse.

She reached for Catherine's wrist.

The moment her fingers touched the armor, fire arced between them.

Not real fire. Magic fire. The kind that lived in the binding, in the silver threads that had grown into Catherine's skin like infection. The kind that recognized Elara's gift as a threat and *reacted.*

Elara didn't let go.

She pressed her palm flat against the gauntlet. Felt the armor's scream become a howl. Felt Catherine flinch but hold steady, soldier-still, used to pain the way Elara was used to heat.

And underneath the screaming, underneath the magic fighting her, Elara felt—

A seam.

Small. Hidden. But *there.*

"It can be removed," she said. Her voice sounded strange. Distant. Like she was speaking from the bottom of a well. "Not easily. Not quickly. And it's going to hurt."

"How much?"

Elara met Catherine's eyes. "More than the binding did."

Catherine was quiet for a long moment. Then: "When do we start?"

"Tomorrow. My forge. Dawn." Elara pulled her hand back. Her palm was smoking. Not burned—she'd stopped being able to burn years ago, her gift had made her fireproof in all the ways that mattered—but smoking anyway, the residue of magic meeting metal meeting *more.*

"I'll be there."

Catherine turned to leave. Made it three steps before Elara called after her.

"Wait."

Catherine stopped. Looked back.

"Why did you volunteer? Seven years ago. For the binding."

Catherine's face was unreadable. "Because I wanted to serve my queen. To be useful. To be—" She stopped. Started again. "Because I thought being the perfect knight meant something."

"And now?"

"Now I'd give anything to be imperfect again."

She walked away. The armor screamed with every step, a sound no one else could hear. A sound that would haunt Elara's dreams tonight, the same way her mother's last scream still haunted them sometimes, the difference between heat and horror measured in degrees she'd never forget.

Elara stood in the market square and watched Catherine disappear around the corner onto Silver Street. Watched the crowd flow back into the space she'd left, merchants calling their wares, farmers haggling over turnips, the girl with the candied nuts laughing at something her customer said.

Normal. Everything was normal.

Except Elara's palm was still smoking.

And she could still taste Catherine's armor in her back teeth—cold silver, old magic, desperation measured in years instead of moments.

And something else.

Something that tasted like hope, even though Elara knew better than to hope. Hope was what her mother had felt the morning the forge fire had spread faster than either of them could run. Hope was dangerous.

But Catherine's eyes had been the color of summer moss.

And the armor had a seam.

And tomorrow at dawn, Elara would try to free a woman who'd volunteered to become a cage seven years ago and was only now learning to want the key.

Elara picked up her hammer. Turned back to the horseshoe that had been waiting, patient, while her whole world tilted sideways. Quarter-turn clockwise. Two strikes. Quarter-turn.

The rhythm was prayer.

The rhythm was breath.

The rhythm was the only thing that kept her hands from shaking.

Tomorrow. Dawn.

*Don't hope,* she told herself. *Don't.*

But her hands were already sketching designs in her mind—tools she'd need to forge, techniques she'd need to try, ways to coax silver and magic and desperation into letting go.

By the time she'd finished the horseshoe, the sun was setting. The market square was empty. Her forge fire needed banking for the night.

And Elara's palm had stopped smoking.

But she could still feel where Catherine's armor had touched her skin. Could still feel the heat that wasn't heat, the connection that wasn't connection, the beginning of something that didn't have a name yet but tasted like metal and moss and the space between danger and want.

She touched her palm to her lips. Tasted silver. Tasted magic.

Tasted the exact temperature at which duty became devotion.

Tomorrow. Dawn.

She was going to save Catherine Valois.

Or burn trying.
