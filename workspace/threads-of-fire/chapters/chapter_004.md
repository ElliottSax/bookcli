# Chapter 4

Seven days.

Elara counted them the way she counted everything else—with precision that bordered on obsession. Seven days of Catherine arriving at dawn. Seven days of thread removal, three to five threads per session. Seven days of watching Catherine's right arm emerge from its silver prison piece by piece, wound by wound, revelation by revelation.

Forty-four threads removed total. Zero remaining in Catherine's right arm from shoulder to fingertips.

Temperature progression: 32°C (day one) → 31°C (day two) → 32°C (day three) → 33°C (day five) → 34°C (day seven, this morning).

Warming. Slowly. Like Catherine's body was remembering how to generate heat now that the armor wasn't suppressing it.

The right arm was bare now. Completely. No gauntlet, no vambrace, no rerebrace protecting the upper arm, no pauldron guarding the shoulder. Seven years of silver peeled away to reveal skin that looked like it belonged to someone else—pale, translucent, threaded with silver veins that caught the light like spiderwebs in morning dew.

Beautiful. Terrible. Fragile in a way that made Elara's chest tight every time she looked at it.

Catherine stood at the forge now, staring at her exposed arm like it was a stranger's limb grafted onto her body. Her right hand flexed, curled, stretched. Testing. Relearning.

"I can feel the heat," Catherine said.

"That's good."

"No. I mean—I can *feel* it. The forge. The air. Your hand when you bandaged me." Catherine's voice cracked. "I haven't felt temperature in seven years. I'd forgotten—"

She stopped. Swallowed. Her throat worked.

Elara waited.

"It's too much," Catherine finished quietly. "Everything. The air touching my skin. The weight of fabric. The temperature differential between my right side and my left. I don't know how to—" She stopped again. "How do people live like this? Feeling everything?"

"You get used to it."

"I don't want to get used to it. I want it to stop."

But her hand reached toward the forge anyway. Palm out. Testing the heat gradient. Forty centimeters away, then thirty, then twenty. Catherine's expression shifted—pain, wonder, fear, all of it cycling across her face faster than Elara could catalog.

"Closer and it burns," Elara said. "That's fifteen centimeters. Remember that distance."

Catherine nodded. Didn't pull back. Her hand hovered in the dangerous zone—close enough to hurt, not close enough to scar.

"Why?" Elara asked.

"Why what?"

"Why are you testing the burn threshold?"

"Because I need to know where the line is." Catherine pulled back. Examined her palm. No damage. "I've spent seven years unable to feel pain. I need to relearn what hurts."

"Or you could trust me when I tell you something's dangerous."

"Trust requires practice too."

Fair point.

Elara turned back to the anvil. She'd been working on a commission—horseshoes for the miller's draft horses—but the work felt wrong this morning. Too routine. Too disconnected from the truth that Catherine's deadline was five weeks away and they'd only freed one arm.

"Can I try?" Catherine asked.

Elara looked up. "Try what?"

"Forging. Working the metal." Catherine gestured at the anvil with her bare right hand. "You do it every day. I used to do it—before the binding, my training included basic smithing. Weapon maintenance, armor repair. I want to see if I remember."

"Your arm—"

"Is weak. I know. That's why I need to try." Catherine's jaw set in that stubborn line Elara had learned meant argument was useless. "Please."

Elara studied her. Catherine's right arm was healing well—the wounds from thread removal had closed clean, no infection, thin silver scars marking where each thread had been. But the muscle underneath was atrophied. Seven years of the armor doing the work while Catherine's body wasted away inside it.

"Simple task only," Elara said. "No heavy hammering. Nothing that requires precision."

"Agreed."

Elara selected a length of iron stock—already heated, already workable. Set it on the anvil. Handed Catherine a hammer.

The hammer was two kilograms. Not heavy. Standard forge weight.

Catherine took it in her right hand and nearly dropped it.

They both stared.

"I—" Catherine's fingers tightened around the handle. "I used to wield a longsword. Four kilograms, easy. This is half that weight and I can barely—"

"The armor was doing the work," Elara said quietly. "Your muscles have been inactive for seven years."

"I know that. Intellectually. But knowing and experiencing are—" Catherine lifted the hammer. Her hand trembled. The tremor wasn't fear this time. It was weakness. Muscle failure. "Different."

"We can stop."

"No." Catherine positioned herself at the anvil. Adjusted her stance. The posture was perfect—feet shoulder-width apart, weight balanced, core engaged. Muscle memory from knight training. But her arm shook holding the hammer aloft. "Tell me what to do."

"Quarter-turn on the stock. Heat it in the forge first."

Catherine used tongs to lift the iron—her left hand, still gauntleted, still strong. The contrast was stark. Left arm: steady, powerful, armored. Right arm: bare, weak, human.

She placed the stock in the coals. Waited. Pulled it out when it glowed orange-red.

"Now strike," Elara said. "Center of the stock. Don't overthink it."

Catherine raised the hammer. Brought it down.

The strike was weak. Barely dented the iron. The hit a child might make, or someone who'd never held a hammer before.

Catherine stared at the stock. At the pathetic dimple her strike had created.

"Again," Elara said.

Second strike. better. Still weak.

Third strike. The hammer slipped. Catherine caught it before it fell, but barely.

"I can't," Catherine said.

"You can. You're relearning."

"I used to be able to crush a man's skull in armor with one strike. Now I can't dent iron."

"You used to have magic-enhanced strength. Now you have human strength. There's a difference."

"I know the difference." Catherine's voice was rising. "The difference is I'm useless. Weak. I've spent seven years becoming perfect and I'm worse than I started. I'm—"

The hammer fell. Clattered on the stone floor.

Catherine's bare hand shook. Not trembling now. Shaking. Full-body tremors running from fingertips to shoulder.

"Catherine."

"I can't even hold a hammer." Catherine's voice cracked. "How am I supposed to—when the armor's fully removed, how am I supposed to protect anyone? How am I supposed to be—"

She stopped. Her jaw clenched. Teeth grinding hard enough Elara could see the muscle jump.

Elara picked up the hammer. Set it aside. Moved to Catherine's side.

"You're not supposed to protect anyone," Elara said.

"That's my purpose. That's why I volunteered for the binding. To be strong enough to—"

"To be perfect. You said that before. But perfection was killing you."

"At least I was useful while dying."

"You were alone while dying."

Catherine flinched like the words were a physical blow.

Elara continued. "You told me you haven't slept in seven years. Haven't eaten properly. Haven't felt temperature or touch or anything human. You turned yourself into a weapon and now you're angry that weapons don't make good people."

"I never wanted to be a person. I wanted to be strong enough that Mara's death would never happen again."

"Mara's death already happened. Being strong doesn't change the past."

"It changes the future."

"Does it?" Elara gestured at the anvil. At the barely-dented iron. "You had seven years of enhanced strength. Did it bring her back? Did it make you happy? Did it make you human?"

Catherine's breath was coming faster now. Shallow. Her chest rising and falling in a rhythm that wasn't controlled anymore.

"No," Catherine said. "It didn't."

"So maybe strength isn't the answer."

"Then what is?"

Elara didn't have an answer. Didn't have words for the thing building between them—the way Catherine's pain made Elara's hands ache to fix it, the way Catherine's presence made counting ceiling beams at night feel less important than counting hours until dawn, the way looking at Catherine's bare arm made Elara think about silver veins and freckles and the exact temperature at which caring became wanting.

Instead she said, "Try again."

"I'll fail again."

"Probably. But you'll fail less. That's how learning works."

Catherine looked at her. looked. Summer-moss eyes tracking across Elara's face like she was searching for something—truth, maybe, or permission to be weak.

"What if I can't?" Catherine asked quietly. "What if I'm never strong again? What if removing the armor doesn't make me human, it makes me helpless?"

"Then you'll be helpless and human instead of strong and alone. Some people would call that an improvement."

"Would you?"

The question landed heavy. Elara thought about her mother. About the moment the forge exploded. About the choice her mother made—push Elara away, take the blast herself. Strength that killed the strong person and left the weak one alive.

"Yes," Elara said. "I would."

Catherine picked up the hammer.

This time when she struck, Elara guided her—hand on Catherine's wrist, correcting the angle. Catherine's skin was warm. 34°C exactly, same as this morning, but it felt warmer under Elara's palm. Felt alive.

The strike landed better. Deeper dent.

"Again," Elara said.

They worked together. Elara's hand on Catherine's, correcting, adjusting, teaching the muscle memory that seven years had erased. Strike. Adjust. Strike. Adjust. The iron slowly taking shape under repeated blows.

Not a horseshoe. Not anything useful. a bent piece of metal that proved Catherine could still learn, could still do, could still be more than armor.

Twenty minutes. Thirty. Catherine's arm was shaking with fatigue but she didn't stop. Stubborn. Determined. The same determination that had kept her alive in armor for seven years now bent toward learning to live outside it.

On the forty-third strike, Catherine laughed.

It was short. Rusty. The sound of vocal cords that had forgotten how to express joy. But it was real.

Elara's hand tightened on Catherine's wrist. "What?"

"This is terrible." Catherine gestured at the mangled iron. "I've created the worst piece of metalwork in the history of smithing. It's aggressively bad. If metal could scream, this would be screaming."

"It's not that bad."

"Elara. It's horrific. I've offended the iron."

"Iron doesn't have feelings."

"This iron does. And it hates me."

Another laugh. less rusty. Catherine's shoulders were shaking with it—mirth instead of weakness, humor instead of pain.

Elara realized she was smiling. When had she started smiling? She didn't smile. Smiling required letting walls down, and walls were important, and Catherine was leaving in five weeks when the armor came off, and getting attached was dangerous, and—

Catherine turned. They were close. Had been close for the last thirty minutes, Elara's hand on Catherine's wrist, bodies angled together at the anvil. But this was different. This was Catherine facing her, both of them suddenly aware of the proximity.

"Thank you," Catherine said.

"For letting you make terrible metalwork?"

"For making me try." Catherine's smile faded. "For not letting me give up."

"You don't seem like someone who gives up easily."

"I gave up on being human seven years ago. You're making me try again."

Elara's throat was tight. She should step back. Should create distance. Should remember that her father had visited yesterday and warned her: *Don't get attached to someone who's leaving.*

Too late for that.

"Same time tomorrow?" Elara asked.

"Same time."

Catherine left. Elara listened to her footsteps—still uneven, right side lighter than left, armor-weight distributed wrong now that one arm was free.

The forge felt empty without her.

Elara turned back to the anvil. The mangled iron sat there, cooling. Catherine was right—it was terrible. Aggressively bad. The iron probably did hate them.

Elara picked it up anyway. Set it aside instead of scrapping it. Added it to the collection: gauntlet, vambrace, rerebrace, pauldron. Forty-four threads in a glass vial. One terrible piece of bent metal.

Evidence that Catherine had been here. That she was trying. That she was human underneath all that armor, and the human parts were worth saving.

Outside, dawn became morning became afternoon.

Elara worked on actual commissions. Horseshoes for the miller. A repair job for the baker's oven door. Three dulled knives that needed resharpening.

Routine work. Muscle memory. Her hands knew what to do even while her mind was elsewhere—counting hours until Catherine came back, counting threads still remaining (hundreds, maybe thousands), counting the ways this could end badly.

The bell above the forge door chimed.

Elara looked up. Not Catherine—her father.

Thomas Thorne was sixty-two years old, 182cm tall, with hands scarred from forty years of forge work and eyes that saw too much. He'd taught Elara everything about metalwork and nothing about how to deal with grief. They lived in the same house and barely spoke.

"You're getting attached," he said.

No greeting. No preamble. Straight to the judgment.

"I'm helping a client," Elara replied.

"You're falling for someone who's dying."

"She's not dying. I'm removing the armor."

"And when you've removed it? She goes back to her kingdom. Back to her life. You stay here with a forge and memories." Thomas crossed to the workbench. Picked up Catherine's gauntlet. Examined it. "This is Eldergard royal armor. Magic binding. The thing they don't let citizens keep after service ends. When this armor comes off, she'll be recalled. Court-martialed for breaking the binding. Best case: exile. Worst case: execution."

Elara's hands stilled on the knife she'd been sharpening.

"You didn't think about that," Thomas said. It wasn't a question.

"about keeping her alive."

"Alive in a cell. Alive as a fugitive. Alive and alone because you can't follow her into whatever punishment Eldergard decides." He set the gauntlet down. "I'm not telling you to stop. I'm telling you to think about what happens after."

"After she's alive. That's what happens."

"After you've saved her and lost her anyway." Thomas's voice gentled. Not much. enough to prove he wasn't being cruel, honest. "your mother die. Watched you blame yourself. I won't watch you break your heart trying to save someone who's already leaving."

"You don't know that."

"I know politics. I know armor magic. I know that Eldergard doesn't let their perfect soldiers retire peacefully." He moved toward the door. Stopped. "She's a good person. I can see that. But good people leave too. Sometimes they don't have a choice."

He left.

Elara stood in the forge surrounded by evidence of Catherine's existence—armor pieces, mangled iron, the lingering warmth in the air from where Catherine had stood at the anvil.

Her father was right. he was right. Catherine was Eldergard nobility, bound by oaths and duty and political arrangements Elara didn't understand. Removing the armor didn't remove the obligations. Didn't change who Catherine was or where she belonged.

But it changed whether Catherine lived or died.

And Elara had already decided—five days ago, maybe, or seven days ago, or the first moment Catherine walked through the forge door with screaming armor and summer-moss eyes—that Catherine living mattered more than Elara's heart staying intact.

She picked up the terrible piece of metal Catherine had made. Felt its weight. Its truth.

The iron didn't scream. It was iron—bent, imperfect, but honest. A record of Catherine's first attempt at being human instead of perfect.

Elara set it carefully on the shelf next to the armor pieces.

Counted: Seven days complete. Thirty days remaining until Catherine's projected death. Right arm: 100% exposed. Rest of body: maybe seventy pieces of armor, thousands of threads, weeks of work.

Five weeks to remove seven years of armor.

It was going to be close.

---

The next morning Catherine arrived late.

Not by much. Six-fifteen instead of six o'clock. But Catherine had been military-precise for seven days straight, and fifteen minutes felt like failure.

She was limping.

Elara noticed immediately. Right side favoring left. Weight distribution wrong. Catherine's expression was controlled but her jaw was tight.

"What happened?" Elara asked.

"Nothing."

"You're limping."

"I'm adjusting. The armor weight is unbalanced now that one side is lighter. My gait is compensating."

"Show me."

"It's fine."

"Catherine. Show me."

Catherine sat. Unlaced her right boot—awkward with one gauntleted hand and one bare hand, the bare fingers clumsy from disuse. Pulled the boot off.

Her foot was bleeding. Not actively. But the sock was stained red, and when Catherine peeled it away, her heel was raw.

Blisters. Four of them. Broken. Weeping.

"You walked here like that?" Elara asked.

"It's two kilometers. I've marched fifty in armor before."

"That was when you had armor protecting you and magic suppressing the pain."

"I'm aware." Catherine's voice was tight. "This is humiliating enough without commentary."

Elara knelt. Examined the blisters. The largest was three centimeters across, deep enough to be concerning. "Why didn't you wrap it?"

"I didn't notice until I was halfway here."

"You didn't notice your foot bleeding?"

"I'm still relearning sensation. Pain feels like—" Catherine stopped. Started again. "Everything feels like pain right now. Heat, pressure, fabric friction. I can't tell the difference between touch and injury yet."

Elara counted the blisters. Four. Counted the silver scars on Catherine's foot—seventeen visible, threading up from toes toward ankle. Counted to ten so she didn't say something about Catherine needing to take care of herself, because Catherine didn't know how to take care of herself, had spent seven years in armor that prevented self-care.

"Wait here," Elara said.

She retrieved the medical kit. Clean water, cotton bandages, salve. Knelt at Catherine's feet and cleaned the wounds with the clinical precision she'd learned from thread removal.

Catherine was silent. Her hand gripped the edge of the stool hard enough that her knuckles went white.

"Does it hurt?" Elara asked.

"Yes."

"Good."

"Good?"

"Means you're feeling correctly. Means your nerves are working." Elara applied salve. Catherine flinched. "Pain is information. You said that yourself."

"I'm rethinking that philosophy."

"Too late. You're stuck with it."

Elara bandaged the heel. Wrapped it carefully—not too tight, not too loose. The precision that required counting: three wraps horizontal, two diagonal, one securing loop. Perfect.

She sat back. Catherine's foot looked absurd now—silver-scarred, bandaged, human. The foot of someone who was partway between perfect and real.

"You need better boots," Elara said.

"These are military issue. Standard regulation."

"Standard regulation for someone in full armor. You're not in full armor anymore."

"I can't afford new boots."

"I'll make them."

Catherine blinked. "You're a blacksmith."

"I'm a metalworker. I know leather. I can make boots that fit your changing weight distribution."

"I can't pay you."

"I'm not asking you to."

"Elara—"

"You're bleeding through military boots because the armor weight is distributed wrong. That's a problem I can fix. Let me fix it."

Catherine was quiet for a long moment. Her throat worked. Swallowing something—pride, maybe, or the last remnants of the perfect soldier who didn't need help.

"Okay," Catherine said quietly. "Thank you."

Elara nodded. Stood. "We're skipping thread removal today. Your body needs rest."

"We don't have time to rest."

"We don't have time for you to develop an infection in your foot either. One day. That's all."

"But—"

"One day, Catherine. Doctor's orders."

"You're not a doctor."

"In this forge, I'm whatever I need to be."

Catherine smiled. Small. Sad. "What are you today?"

The truth tasted like metal and warmth and the exact temperature of Catherine's skin under Elara's hands. The truth was: *I'm someone who's falling for you and doesn't know how to stop.*

"Your blacksmith," Elara said.

It was true enough.
