# Chapter 11

The final warning arrived on day thirty-six.

Not a letter. Not a messenger. Commander Ashford herself.

She came alone this time. No guards. No ceremony. Walked into the forge at dawn like she had every right to be there.

Catherine was upstairs sleeping. Elara was banking the overnight forge when Ashford entered.

"Mistress Thorne," Ashford said. No greeting. Straight to business. "Where is Dame Valois?"

"Resting."

"Wake her. This concerns you both."

Elara considered refusing. Considered lying. Decided truth was easier.

She went upstairs. Catherine was already awake—had woken when footsteps crossed the threshold below. Seven years of hypervigilance didn't fade in five weeks.

"Your commander is here," Elara said.

Catherine's expression didn't change. "I know. I heard her."

"What do you want to do?"

"Face her. Better to know what's coming."

They went downstairs together.

Ashford stood by the forge, examining the armor pieces laid out on the workbench. Gauntlets. Vambraces. Cuisses. Greaves. All the pieces they'd removed. Evidence of five weeks of work.

"Impressive," Ashford said. "I didn't think it was possible to remove a binding safely. You've proven me wrong."

"Commander," Catherine said. Military posture. Military voice. The soldier underneath the deserter.

Ashford turned. Looked at Catherine. Really looked.

Catherine stood barefoot in a civilian shirt and pants. No armor except the sabatons—the armored boots. Her arms were bare. Her neck was bare. Her face was bare. Silver scars traced her skin like a map of everything the binding had cost.

She looked human. Fragile. Free.

"You're almost done," Ashford said.

"Two days. Maybe three. Then the binding is completely removed."

"And then?"

"Then I live. As a civilian. In Ironhearth."

Ashford's expression didn't change. "That's not possible."

"It's my choice."

"Your choice ended when you deserted. Eldergard has declared you a traitor. The penalty is execution. You have forty-eight hours to return and face court-martial, or we send hunters."

Catherine's hands clenched. "I'm not returning."

"Then you're accepting execution."

"I'm accepting freedom."

"There is no freedom in treason, Catherine. There's only death." Ashford's voice softened. Slightly. "I know what the binding cost you. I know you wanted to live. But this—hiding in a civilian forge, refusing duty, choosing personal survival over service—this isn't the Catherine Valois I trained. This isn't the woman who volunteered to protect people."

"You're right. I'm not her anymore. That woman died slowly in armor for seven years. This woman—" Catherine gestured at herself. "—this woman wants to live. And I'm choosing that."

"At what cost? Do you know what your desertion has caused?" Ashford pulled a folded document from her coat. "Argentum has mobilized. Three battalions on the border. They're using your presence in Ironhearth as evidence that Ferrum is colluding with Eldergard. War is coming, Catherine. Because you wouldn't leave."

Catherine flinched. "War was coming anyway."

"Was it? Or did your personal choice tip the balance?" Ashford set the document on the workbench. "Forty-eight hours. Return, face trial, accept punishment. Or stay and watch thousands die in a war that started because one knight chose herself over duty."

She left.

Silence.

Catherine stood frozen. Staring at the document. At the evidence of her choice's consequences.

Elara crossed to her. "Catherine—"

"She's right." Catherine's voice was flat. "I chose myself. War is coming because I chose myself."

"War was always coming. The kingdoms were looking for an excuse."

"And I gave them one. I'm the excuse. Again." Catherine's hands trembled. "Mara died because I chose myself. I was with Senna instead of watching. Now thousands will die because I chose you instead of duty. I'm—" She stopped. "I'm the cause. Always the cause."

"No. You're not responsible for other people's choices. Argentum chooses war. Eldergard chooses to hunt deserters. You choose to live. Those are separate choices."

"Are they? Or am I just telling myself that so I can sleep at night?"

Elara had no answer for that.

Catherine picked up the document. Unfolded it. Read.

Her expression changed. From guilt to shock to something harder.

"What?" Elara asked.

"Troop movements. Argentum's battle plans. Supply routes." Catherine looked up. "This is classified military intelligence. Ashford shouldn't have this. No one should have this except—"

She stopped.

"Except what?"

"Except the person who stole it from Argentum's war council and gave it to Eldergard." Catherine set the document down carefully. "This is my intelligence."

"Your what?"

"I've been sending information to Ferrum's Council. Since week two. Argentum's battle plans, supply routes, troop numbers. Everything I learned during the peace negotiations. I thought—" She stopped. "I thought I could prevent war by sharing intelligence. Help Ferrum defend themselves. Make my desertion less damaging."

Elara stared. "You've been committing espionage?"

"Yes."

"For five weeks?"

"Yes."

"While hiding in my forge?"

"Yes." Catherine met her eyes. "I didn't tell you because I didn't want you implicated. If I'm caught, it's treason and desertion and espionage. Triple death penalty. But you—you're just the blacksmith who removed armor. You didn't know I was stealing intelligence."

"Catherine—"

"Don't. Don't tell me it was stupid. I know it was stupid. But I couldn't—" Her voice cracked. "I couldn't just hide and let war happen. I had to do something. Had to try to prevent deaths. Even if it meant more risk."

Elara counted to ten. Breathed. Processed.

Catherine had been committing espionage for five weeks. Had been risking execution—triple execution—while pretending everything was fine. Had been carrying that weight alone.

"You should have told me," Elara said.

"I know."

"I could have helped."

"How? You're a blacksmith, not a spy."

"I'm your—" Elara stopped. What were they? Partners? Lovers? Accomplices? "I'm yours. You should have told me."

Catherine was quiet for a long moment. Then: "You're right. I'm sorry. I'm still learning how to share burdens. Seven years alone makes partnership difficult."

"So practice. Tell me things. Even dangerous things. Especially dangerous things."

"Okay." Catherine took a breath. "I've been stealing intelligence for five weeks. Passing it to Ferrum through intermediaries. Trying to prevent war. It's not working. War is coming anyway. And now both kingdoms want me dead. Eldergard for desertion. Argentum for espionage. I'm—" She stopped. "I'm running out of time. And options. And safety."

"What are you going to do?"

"I don't know. Return and face execution? Stay and wait for hunters? Run and keep running forever?"

"Or stay and fight."

"Fight how? I'm one person. Barely armored. Still healing. Against two kingdoms."

"You're not one person. You have me. And Ferrum's Council. And this forge. And two days until the armor's completely removed and you're fully human again." Elara stepped closer. "We finish the removal. We figure out defense. We find a way."

"And if there's no way? If the kingdoms come and there's no defense that works?"

"Then we fought. That's better than running."

Catherine laughed. Short. Bitter. "You have terrible survival instincts."

"Says the woman who's been committing espionage while recovering from binding removal."

"Fair point."

They were standing close now. Close enough to touch. Elara reached out, took Catherine's hands.

"I'd rather die free with you than live perfect and hollow for them," Catherine said quietly. "I know that's dramatic. I know it sounds like a death wish. But it's true. These five weeks with you—learning to want, learning to sleep, learning to be human—they're worth more than seven years of perfection. If the kingdoms come, at least I'll have had this. Had you."

"You're not going to die."

"You can't promise that."

"No. But I can promise I'll fight like hell to keep you alive."

"Promise?"

Elara couldn't promise. Promises required certainty she didn't have. Required control over outcomes she couldn't control.

But she could kiss Catherine. Could pull her close. Could show instead of promising.

They kissed desperate. Urgent. The kiss of people who knew time was running out.

When they pulled apart, Catherine was crying.

"Two days," she said. "We have two days to finish the armor, two days before the forty-eight-hour deadline ends. Two days to figure out how to survive what's coming."

"Then we'd better get started."

Day thirty-seven: They removed the left sabaton.

The armored boot came apart in four pieces. Toe cap, foot plate, ankle guard, heel plate. Threads woven through the bones of Catherine's left foot, wrapped around tendons, anchored to the arch.

It took eight hours.

Catherine's left foot emerged pale and scarred. Silver threads visible between each toe. The foot was slightly deformed—bones compressed from seven years in too-tight armor. Catherine couldn't put weight on it without pain.

"It'll heal," Elara said. "The bones will adjust. Give it time."

"How much time?"

"Weeks. Maybe months."

"We might not have weeks."

"Then we'll deal with that when it comes."

Day thirty-eight: They removed the right sabaton.

Faster this time. Six hours. The threads were similar to the left foot—woven through bone, wrapped around tendons. Catherine's right foot emerged matching her left. Pale. Scarred. Deformed. Free.

Catherine stood on bare feet for the first time in seven years.

And collapsed.

Elara caught her. Again. Always catching her.

"I can't balance," Catherine said. "Seven years in armored boots. My feet don't remember how to support my weight without metal."

"So relearn. Same as everything else."

Catherine tried again. Stood. Swayed. Grabbed the workbench for support.

"How do humans do this?" she asked. "How do you just stand without thinking about it?"

"Practice. Muscle memory. You'll relearn."

Catherine took one step. Careful. Deliberate. Her foot touched the ground wrong—heel first instead of whole foot. She stumbled.

Elara steadied her.

"Again," Elara said.

Catherine tried. Step. Stumble. Step. Stumble.

Thirty minutes. Fifty steps. Most of them wrong. All of them progress.

By hour two, Catherine could walk five steps without support. By hour four, she could cross the forge without holding walls.

By nightfall, she was walking. Uneven. Limping. But walking.

"It's done," Catherine said. "The armor. All of it. Seven years. Gone."

She was standing in the middle of the forge, completely bare. No armor. No threads. No silver except the scars.

Just Catherine. Human. Free.

She started crying. Not gentle tears. Full sobbing. Seven years of armor, five weeks of removal, thirty-eight days of choosing to live, all of it crashing down at once.

Elara held her. Let her cry. Let her break. Let her be human in all the messy, complicated ways humans were allowed to be.

"It's over," Catherine said between sobs. "The binding is over. I'm free."

"You're free."

"Now what?"

"Now we prepare. The kingdoms are coming. Tomorrow or the next day. We have hours, maybe. We use them."

Catherine pulled back. Wiped her eyes. "How do we prepare?"

"Weapons. Barricades. Escape routes." Elara's mind was already calculating. "If they send hunters, we fight. If they send armies, we run. If they send negotiators, we bargain."

"What do we have to bargain with?"

"The intelligence you've been stealing. You know Argentum's battle plans. That's valuable. Ferrum will protect you if you keep sharing."

"That's treason against Argentum. They'll want me dead more."

"They already want you dead. Might as well make it count."

Catherine laughed. Wet. Broken. "When did you become the reckless one?"

"When I fell for a deserter knight and decided her life was worth treason."

Catherine kissed her. Soft. Grateful.

"Tomorrow they come," Catherine said. "Tonight we have this. Us. Free. Together."

"What do you want to do with tonight?"

Catherine's answer was immediate: "Sleep. In your bed. No armor. No fear. No nightmares. You beside me. Let me sleep human for one night before whatever comes next."

"Deal."

They went upstairs. Lay together. Catherine's bare feet pressed against Elara's, both of them tangled close, Catherine's head on Elara's shoulder.

Catherine fell asleep within minutes. Deep sleep. Full sleep. Human sleep.

No nightmares came.

Elara stayed awake. Kept watch. Counted Catherine's heartbeats. Seventy per minute. Human normal. Alive.

Free.

Tomorrow the kingdoms would come. Tomorrow they'd fight or run or bargain.

Tonight Catherine slept free for the first time in seven years.

That had to be enough.
