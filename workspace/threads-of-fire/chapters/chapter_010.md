# Chapter 10

Catherine was learning to want.

Small things first. Elara noticed it in the details:

Day twenty-two: Catherine asked for specific food. "Do you have honey? I remember liking honey."

Day twenty-three: Catherine requested a bath. "Warm water. Is that allowed? Can I want that?"

Day twenty-four: Catherine touched Elara's hand across the breakfast table and didn't pull away. Held on. Wanted the contact.

Seven years of armor meant seven years of not wanting. Not allowed to want food, warmth, touch, rest. The binding suppressed desire along with sensation. Wanting was weakness. Perfection required emptiness.

Catherine was relearning fullness.

"You can want things," Elara told her on day twenty-five. They were in the forge. Catherine watching Elara work. "You're allowed. Practice."

"I don't know how."

"Start small. What do you want right now?"

Catherine was quiet for a long moment. "I want to watch you work. I want to understand what you're thinking when you count. I want—" She stopped. "I want you to look at me the way you did when you asked to kiss me."

Elara looked up. Met Catherine's eyes.

Catherine smiled. Shy. Real.

"Like that," she said.

They were learning each other. Slowly. Carefully.

Elara learned: Catherine liked honey but not jam. Liked her tea warm but not hot. Liked being touched but needed warning first. Liked sleeping close but not entangled. Liked mornings better than evenings. Liked watching Elara work more than working herself.

Catherine learned: Elara counted when anxious. Organized tools when overwhelmed. Worked late when avoiding feelings. Touched Catherine's hand when words were too hard. Made terrible jokes to lighten tension. Cared more than she admitted.

They were building something. Naming it felt dangerous. Not naming it felt dishonest.

On day twenty-six, Elara removed the waist armor.

The faulds and tassets came away in eight pieces. Threads woven through abdominal muscles, wrapped around Catherine's lower ribs, anchored to her pelvis. Not as dangerous as the chest piece. Not as complex as the neck. But painful.

Catherine cried through it. Not from pain—from relief.

"I can breathe," she said when the last piece came away. "Fully. All the way down. I couldn't before. The chest piece allowed some breathing but the waist armor was constricting everything below my ribs. Now I can—"

She demonstrated. Inhaled deeply. Her entire torso expanded. Ribs, abdomen, everything.

Then she laughed. Full. Joyful. The sound of someone discovering they had more lung capacity than they remembered.

"Again," Elara said.

Catherine breathed deep. Laughed. Breathed. Laughed.

She was beautiful like this. Bare from waist up, silver scars tracing her ribs and sternum, bandages wrapped around healing wounds, face alight with joy.

Elara wanted to count her. Wanted to catalog every freckle, every scar, every visible silver thread. Wanted to memorize the exact angle of Catherine's smile, the precise temperature of her skin, the specific rhythm of her breathing.

"You're staring," Catherine said.

"I'm counting."

"What's the count?"

"Seventeen freckles on your face. Forty-three visible silver threads in your torso. One hundred fourteen breaths per minute. All of them deeper than before."

Catherine crossed the distance between them. Slowly. Deliberately. Stopped close enough to touch.

"Can I kiss you?" Catherine asked.

Role reversal. Catherine asking instead of being asked.

"Yes," Elara said.

The kiss was different from before. Less desperate. More certain. Catherine's hands cupped Elara's face, thumbs tracing her cheekbones. Learning her. Counting her in return.

They pulled apart.

"I want you," Catherine said. "Not because you saved me. Not because I'm grateful. Because you're you. Precise and warm and stubborn and kind. You count everything and organize tools and make terrible jokes. You asked before kissing. You waited when I said not yet. You chose me over safety. I want you."

Elara's throat was tight. "I want you too."

"What do we do about that?"

"I don't know. Usually people date. Spend time together. Learn each other."

"We've been spending time together for twenty-six days."

"True. So we're ahead of schedule."

Catherine smiled. "What comes after spending time together?"

"Depends. Some people move in together."

"I already live here."

"True again."

"Some people get married."

Elara's heart skipped. "Eventually. Not after twenty-six days."

"Why not?"

"Because that's insane."

"I've done insane things before. Volunteered for binding. Deserted. Fell for my blacksmith." Catherine's hands were still on Elara's face. "But you're right. Too fast. We should slow down."

"Should we?"

"No." Catherine kissed her again. "But we will anyway. Because you're careful. And I'm learning to be human. And humans apparently don't get married after twenty-six days."

"Generally not."

"What do humans do?"

"They date. They spend months learning each other. They have conversations about feelings. They meet each other's families. They build a life together slowly."

"We don't have months. I'm still being hunted. War is still coming. We have weeks at best."

Elara pulled back. "Then we make the weeks count."

They spent the afternoon not working.

Catherine wanted a bath. Elara heated water, poured it into the copper tub upstairs. Catherine bathed while Elara sat nearby, reading aloud from a book of poetry.

Not romantic poetry. Technical poetry. A manual on metalwork written in verse. Catherine listened like it was music.

Afterward, Catherine wanted to try cooking. She'd never cooked—seven years in armor meant seven years of meal service, food delivered, no preparation required. Before that, she'd been nobility. Servants handled cooking.

They made soup. Vegetables and stock and herbs. Simple. Catherine's knife work was clumsy. She cut carrots into uneven chunks, sliced onions too thick, nearly cut her own finger twice.

The soup was terrible.

They ate it anyway.

"This is awful," Catherine said.

"Aggressively awful."

"The vegetables hate us."

"Probably."

They smiled at each other across the terrible soup.

"I like this," Catherine said. "Doing normal human things. Badly. Together."

"Me too."

That night, they slept close. Catherine's head on Elara's shoulder, Elara's arm around Catherine's waist. Not sexual. Not yet. building toward something. Learning to want proximity. Learning to trust closeness.

Catherine fell asleep first. Elara counted her breaths. Thirty-two per minute. Slow. Even. Human.

Safe.

Elara fell asleep counting.

Day twenty-eight: The nightmare came back.

Worse than before. Catherine woke screaming, thrashing, fighting invisible armor. Her elbow caught Elara's ribs. Accidental. Panic-driven.

Elara caught her wrists. "Catherine. Count with me."

"I can't—the armor—it's back—"

"It's not back. Look at your arms. Bare. Free. Count with me."

Catherine's eyes focused. Saw her bare arms. Saw Elara holding her wrists gently. Saw reality instead of nightmare.

She collapsed. Not unconscious. Exhausted. The kind of tired that came from fighting demons that didn't exist.

"I'm sorry," she said.

"Don't apologize."

"I hit you."

"Accidentally. I'm fine."

"I'm not fine. I don't know how to sleep without being vigilant. Seven years of armor meant seven years of meditation instead of sleep. Light trance. Always aware. Always ready. I don't know how to let go completely."

"So don't. Not yet." Elara pulled Catherine close. "Sleep light. I'll stay awake. Keep watch."

"You can't stay awake all night."

"I've done it before. Overnight commissions. Urgent repairs. I can handle one night."

"Elara—"

"Let me do this. Please."

Catherine was quiet. Then nodded against Elara's shoulder.

Elara stayed awake. Counted ceiling beams (fourteen). Counted Catherine's heartbeats (sixty-eight per minute, slower in sleep). Counted the hours until dawn (six).

Catherine slept restless but didn't wake screaming. Progress.

When dawn came, Elara was exhausted. Catherine was apologetic. They compromised: Catherine would work on sleeping deeper, Elara would work on waking for nightmares.

Fair trade.

Day thirty: Catherine laughed at a customer.

Not maliciously. The customer had asked Elara to repair a decorative sword—purely ornamental, couldn't cut butter. The customer insisted it was a "family heirloom worthy of respect."

Elara said, "Sir, this sword has never seen combat. It's a wall decoration. I can polish it but there's nothing to repair."

Catherine, sitting by the forge, snorted. Then laughed. Full, genuine, the sound of someone who'd forgotten how ridiculous humans could be.

The customer left offended.

Catherine laughed harder.

"You just cost me a commission," Elara said.

"Worth it. Did you see his face? He was so serious about his decoration sword."

"It was a family heirloom."

"It was garbage dressed up as legacy."

They were both laughing now. Elara couldn't remember the last time she'd laughed at a customer. Professionalism usually prevented it. But Catherine made everything feel lighter.

"You're a terrible influence," Elara said.

"I know. Do you mind?"

"No."

Catherine stood. Crossed to Elara. Kissed her. Quick. Casual. The kind of kiss that said *I can do this now, touch you without fear, want you without asking*.

"I like this," Catherine said. "Being with you. Laughing at ridiculous people. Eating terrible soup. Learning to want things. All of it."

"Even the nightmares?"

"Even those. Because you're there when I wake up."

Elara's chest was tight. "I'll always be there when you wake up."

"You can't promise that."

"I can promise I'll try. That's all anyone can promise."

Catherine kissed her again. Longer this time. Deeper.

They pulled apart breathless.

"How much armor is left?" Catherine asked.

"Legs and feet. Ten pieces. Maybe two hundred threads. Two weeks if we're careful."

"And then?"

"Then you're free. Completely. And we figure out what comes next."

"Together?"

"Together."

---

Day thirty-three: Elara started on the leg armor.

The cuisses (thigh armor) and greaves (shin armor) came away easier than expected. The threads here were shallow—woven into muscle but not bone, anchored to tissue but not arteries.

Progress was fast. Both thighs exposed in three days. Both shins exposed in two.

By day thirty-five, only the feet remained.

Catherine stood in the forge wearing: nothing. No armor. Bare from head to toe except the sabatons—the armored boots.

She looked smaller without armor. More human. More fragile. More real.

"Last pieces," Catherine said, looking down at her feet. "Seven years. Comes down to boots."

"Fitting. You came here limping. You'll leave walking."

"Will I leave?"

The question hung heavy.

"Do you want to?" Elara asked.

"No. But wanting and having are different things. The kingdoms will come for me eventually. I can't hide in your forge forever."

"Why not?"

"Because you deserve a life that's not defined by protecting a fugitive."

"What if I want my life to include you?"

"Even if it means constant danger? Even if it means hiding? Even if it means war could come to your door?"

Elara met her eyes. "Yes. Even then."

Catherine crossed to her. Took her hands.

"Ask me again," Catherine said.

"Ask you what?"

"What you've been thinking for a week. Ask me."

Elara's heart rate elevated. She knew what Catherine meant. Had been thinking it. Hadn't said it.

"Stay," Elara said. "After the armor's gone. Don't run. Don't hide. Stay here. With me. Build a life that's not defined by armor or duty or kingdoms. Stay."

"Yes," Catherine said.

They kissed until breathing became difficult.

Then Catherine added: "But we should probably finish removing the armor first. Walking in armored boots for the rest of my life would be inconvenient."

Elara laughed. "Probably."

"Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow."

That night they slept tangled together. Catherine's nightmares were quieter. Elara's watch was lighter. They were learning. Building something sustainable.

Tomorrow the armor would be gone completely.

Tomorrow Catherine would be free.

Tomorrow they would begin whatever came next.

Together.
