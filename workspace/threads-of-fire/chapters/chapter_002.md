# Chapter 2

Elara didn't sleep.

She counted ceiling beams instead. Fourteen. Same as last night, same as every night for the eight years she'd lived in the room above the forge. The wood grain ran northeast to southwest—she'd traced the patterns so many times she could map them with her eyes closed. Knot in beam seven at coordinates roughly 40cm from the west wall, 15cm from the southern edge. Another in beam twelve, smaller, 8mm diameter.

Counting was easier than thinking about dawn.

Counting was easier than thinking about Catherine Valois's hands.

Those hands had been pale. Bloodless. The nails cut military-short, no ornamentation, nothing soft. But the fingers had been long—longer than Elara's, which meant something because Elara's hands were big for a woman's hands, work-roughened and scarred and built for gripping hammer handles.

Catherine's hands had trembled when Elara touched the gauntlet.

Just for a second. Just a micro-tremor that someone who didn't spend their life reading metal—reading *everything*—might have missed. But Elara had felt it. Had cataloged it. Had added it to the growing list of things she knew about Dame Catherine Valois:

- Height: 178cm (2cm taller than Elara)
- Skin temperature at neck: approximately 32°C (hypothermic)
- Armor thickness: 2-3mm silver alloy
- Eye color: summer moss green (Pantone 18-0135 TPX if you were being specific)
- Time since last proper sleep: unknown but visible in the fine lines at corners of eyes
- Hand tremor when touched: 0.4 seconds duration
- Probability she'd show up at dawn: unknown

Elara turned over. Stared at the opposite wall. Counted bricks. Forty-seven across, twenty-three high. One thousand eighty-one total. She'd counted them before.

The church bell tolled four times.

Two hours until dawn.

She gave up on sleep. Rose. Pulled on her work clothes—leather pants that had been her mother's once, back when her mother had been alive and tall and strong enough to wear them. The pants were too long on Elara still. She'd never grown into her mother's height. Had inherited the gift, the forge, the burn scars. Not the extra four centimeters.

The forge was cold. Dead. Elara knelt in front of it the way some people knelt in churches—with the particular reverence reserved for the thing that gave your life meaning. She built the fire methodically. Tinder first. Kindling second. Larger wood third. Waited for the temperature to climb.

Two hundred degrees. Four hundred. Six hundred.

At eight hundred degrees, iron started to glow. At one thousand, it became workable. At fifteen hundred thirty-eight, it melted.

At fifteen hundred thirty-eight degrees Celsius, her mother had stopped screaming.

Elara fed more wood to the fire. Watched the flames climb. Didn't think about that morning. Didn't think about the smell. Didn't think about her father's face when he'd looked at Elara afterward—looked at her like she was the reason, like if Elara had been faster or smarter or *better* then maybe—

Not thinking about that.

The fire climbed to temperature. Elara selected her tools.

If she was going to try removing Catherine's armor, she needed instruments she didn't have. Couldn't buy. Would have to forge herself.

Fine tools. Precise tools. Tools for working with silver-magic alloy that was fused to human tissue.

She started with a probe. Thin steel rod, 2mm diameter, 30cm long. Forged the tip to a point fine enough to slip between armor plates without catching. Quenched it. Tested it against her own scarred forearm—pressed until it dimpled skin but didn't break through. Good. That was the pressure threshold she needed. Gentle enough not to damage. Sharp enough to separate.

She forged three more probes. Different lengths, different angles. Laid them out on her workbench in order of increasing fineness.

The church bell tolled five times.

One hour.

Elara's hands were shaking.

She pressed them flat on the workbench. Counted to ten. The tremor didn't stop.

Fear-shaking, not fatigue-shaking. She knew the difference. Had spent three years after her mother's death shaking every time she lit the forge, every time the fire climbed past one thousand degrees, every time the metal glowed red-orange-yellow-white.

She'd eventually stopped. Learned to trust heat again. Learned to trust herself.

But Catherine's armor had *screamed.*

And Catherine's hands had trembled when Elara touched them.

And Elara didn't know which scared her more—the armor, or the way her heart had kicked against her ribs when those summer-moss eyes had met hers across the market square.

The church bell tolled six times.

Dawn.

Elara cleaned her workspace. Arranged the tools. Set out clean linen cloths—the ones her mother had used for wrapping finished blades, before the fire, before everything. Put water on to boil. Scrubbed her hands until the skin was raw.

And waited.

The knock came at quarter past six.

Three knocks. Precise. Military timing even in this.

Elara opened the door.

Catherine stood in the pre-dawn grey, still wearing full armor, helmet under one arm. She looked worse than yesterday. The kind of exhaustion that lived deeper than bone, that had settled into marrow and forgotten what rest felt like.

"You came," Elara said. Heard her voice come out rougher than intended.

"I said I would."

"People say a lot of things."

Catherine's mouth quirked. Almost a smile. "So they do."

They stood in the doorway. The space between them was maybe 60cm. Close enough that Elara could smell Catherine—still cold, still steel, still that winter-cave-darkness scent that didn't belong on a living person.

"Are you going to let me in?" Catherine asked. "Or are we doing this in the street?"

Elara stepped back. Gestured. "Forge is through there."

Catherine walked past her into the workshop. Moved like someone who'd spent seven years learning to compensate for twenty-five kilograms of metal fused to their skeleton. Graceful despite it. Economical. Every motion calculated to waste zero energy.

She stopped in the center of the forge. Looked around.

Elara tried to see it through Catherine's eyes: The anvil her mother had bought thirty years ago. The slack tub in the corner, water dark with rust. The tools hanging on the wall in precise order—hammers increasing in size left to right, tongs organized by jaw width. The bellows her father had repaired twice and refused to replace because *it still works, doesn't it?*

The forge itself, cold now, ashes from this morning's forging still grey in the bottom.

"It's smaller than I expected," Catherine said.

"Most forges are."

"But you're the best smith in Ironhearth."

"Being the best doesn't require a palace." Elara moved to her workbench. Touched the tools she'd forged—grounding gesture, reminder that her hands could make things, could *fix* things. "It requires knowing what metal wants."

"And what does metal want?"

"To be true to itself. To hold the shape it was meant for. To serve without breaking." Elara met Catherine's eyes. "Your armor doesn't want to be fused to your bones."

Catherine was quiet for a moment. Then: "No. I don't suppose it does."

"The gauntlet," Elara said. "We'll start there. It's the furthest from your core. If something goes wrong—"

"If something goes wrong, I die slower."

"Yes."

Catherine nodded. Set her helmet on the workbench. Started working at the fastenings on her right gauntlet.

And stopped.

Her fingers—those pale, trembling fingers—scrabbled at the buckles. Found them. Couldn't make them release.

"They're rusted shut," Catherine said. Her voice was carefully neutral. "Seven years without removing them. The mechanism seized."

"Let me."

Elara stepped closer. Close enough to see the buckles clearly—small, intricate, silver worked with gold. Close enough to smell Catherine's exhaustion and fear mixing with cold steel. Close enough to hear Catherine's breath catch when Elara's fingers brushed her wrist.

The buckles weren't rusted. They were *grown over.* Fine silver threads had woven through the mechanism, binding it closed the way scar tissue bound a wound.

Elara pulled one of her probes from her belt. Slid it into the gap between buckle and thread. Felt for the release point.

The armor screamed.

Not loud. Not the howl from yesterday. But a high, thin wail that made Elara's teeth ache and her gift flare bright enough to see the entire forge in shades of metal-truth. The anvil was angry (hammer-struck ten thousand times, wanting rest). The tongs were tired (jaws worn, asking to be reforged). The walls themselves held traces of her mother's work—decades of iron and love and heat soaked into stone.

And Catherine's armor was *terrified.*

"Don't stop," Catherine said. Her voice was steady despite the way her whole arm was shaking now. "Please. Don't stop."

Elara didn't stop.

She worked the probe deeper. Found the catch. Released it.

The buckle opened.

The gauntlet loosened.

Catherine made a sound—half gasp, half sob, immediately swallowed. Soldier's reflex. Don't show weakness. Don't show pain. Don't show anything.

"One more buckle," Elara said. Her own voice was shaking now. "At the wrist."

This one was worse. The threads had grown thicker here, closer to Catherine's pulse point. They'd woven into the leather underpadding, into the fabric beneath, into—

Skin.

Elara could see it when the gauntlet shifted. See the silver threads disappearing under the edge of Catherine's sleeve. See the way they'd rooted into flesh like mistletoe into oak, parasitic and permanent.

Her hands shook harder.

"I can feel you shaking," Catherine said. "Are you afraid?"

"Yes."

"Of hurting me?"

"Of not being able to help you."

Catherine looked at her. Really looked. Those summer-moss eyes searching Elara's face for—what? Lies? Truth? Pity?

"You're already helping," Catherine said quietly. "No one else has tried."

Elara released the second buckle.

The gauntlet fell away.

Underneath, Catherine's hand was—

Wrong.

Not deformed. Not damaged. Just *wrong.* Pale as paper. Thin enough to see every bone, every tendon moving under skin that looked like it hadn't seen sun in seven years. The nails were silver. Not painted. Actually silver. Growing from the nailbed like metal instead of keratin.

And the silver threads.

They wrapped around her wrist like bracelets. Disappeared up her forearm under the sleeve. Pulsed faintly with magic-light, in rhythm with Catherine's heartbeat.

62 beats per minute. Elara counted automatically. Too slow for someone who should be terrified. But Catherine's heart didn't know how to race anymore. Had forgotten how.

"It's worse than I thought," Elara said.

"I know."

"The threads—they've grown into your circulatory system. Into your veins."

"I know."

"If I cut them wrong, you'll bleed out in minutes."

"I know." Catherine flexed her revealed hand. Stared at it like she was seeing a stranger's hand. "I haven't seen this hand in seven years. I'd forgotten—" She stopped. Swallowed. "I'd forgotten I had freckles."

There were three freckles on the back of Catherine's right hand. Small. Constellation-pattern. Ursa Minor, maybe, if you squinted and believed in signs.

Elara's throat closed.

Not fear. Not quite. Something else. Something that tasted like the moment before a hammer strike, when metal was hot and malleable and you had one chance to shape it right or ruin it forever.

"I'm going to touch your hand now," Elara said. "To read the threads. To see where they go."

"It'll hurt."

"Probably."

"Do it anyway."

Elara set down her probe. Reached out. Placed her palm against Catherine's palm.

Fire arced between them.

Real fire this time. Magic fire. The kind that recognized Elara's gift as threat and Catherine's desperation as fuel. The kind that burned cold instead of hot, that froze instead of melted, that lived in the space between what *was* and what *should be.*

Elara didn't let go.

She pressed deeper. Let her gift unfold completely—the way she never did in public, the way she'd been taught to hide because people didn't trust smiths who could read metal's truth. Let herself *see.*

The threads were roots. Growing up Catherine's arm, into her shoulder, across her chest, wrapping around ribs like ivy around a trellis. They'd reached her heart. Not penetrated it—couldn't, the heart was too vital, even magic knew that. But they'd *surrounded* it. Caged it. Squeezed it just enough that every beat had to fight against silver resistance.

Seven years of fighting. Seven years of the heart trying to pump blood through a body that was slowly being replaced by metal. Seven years of Catherine's humanity narrowing, degree by degree, until there was almost nothing left.

Elara pulled back. Gasped. Tasted copper.

"How bad?" Catherine asked.

"Three months was optimistic."

"How long do I actually have?"

"Six weeks. Maybe eight."

Catherine nodded. Didn't cry. Didn't rage. Just nodded with that soldier's acceptance of impossible odds. "Can you remove it in six weeks?"

"I don't know."

"That's not a no."

"It's not a yes either."

"But you'll try."

Elara looked at Catherine's revealed hand. At the three freckles in Ursa Minor pattern. At the silver nails and paper-pale skin and the threads that pulsed in time with a heart that was running out of beats.

"I'll try," Elara said.

"Starting when?"

"Now. Today. Every day until—" She stopped. Started again. "Until we've removed every piece."

Catherine's hand trembled in Elara's grip. "It's going to hurt."

"More than you can imagine."

"I can imagine a lot."

"Then it'll hurt more than that."

Catherine smiled. It was small. Sad. The smile of someone who'd stopped expecting comfort and was surprised to find honesty instead. "When do we start?"

"We already have."

---

They worked for three hours.

Elara mapped the threads in Catherine's wrist. Traced them with probes. Drew diagrams on paper—technical sketches showing exactly where silver met flesh, where magic had woven itself into veins, where cutting would sever and where it would kill.

Catherine didn't speak much. Answered questions when asked. Held perfectly still while Elara worked. Flinched only twice—once when a probe touched a nerve cluster, once when Elara had to cut a single thread away from the underside of Catherine's wrist.

The thread had come away like fishing line from wet wood. Reluctant. Clinging. And when it separated—

Catherine screamed.

Not loud. Through clenched teeth. A soldier's scream, minimal and controlled and still *wrong* in the way that any scream was wrong from someone who'd learned not to make sounds.

Elara caught Catherine before she fell.

For a moment they stood like that—Elara's arms around Catherine's waist, Catherine's weight against Elara's shoulder, both of them shaking with adrenaline and fear and something else that tasted like heat despite Catherine's cold.

"I'm alright," Catherine said into Elara's shoulder.

"You're not."

"I'm still breathing."

"That's a low bar."

"It's my bar."

Elara didn't let go. Counted Catherine's heartbeats against her chest. Still 62 per minute. Too slow. Too controlled. A heart that had forgotten how to panic.

"We're stopping for today," Elara said.

"We've only removed one thread."

"And it almost killed you."

"There are hundreds of threads."

"I know."

"At this rate—"

"We'll get faster. I'll get better." Elara pulled back. Met Catherine's eyes. "But not today. Today you need rest."

"I don't rest."

"When's the last time you slept?"

Catherine was quiet.

"That's what I thought," Elara said. "Go back to wherever you're staying. Sleep. Eat something. Come back tomorrow at dawn."

"I can—"

"That's an order."

Catherine blinked. "You can't give me orders."

"In my forge, I can."

They stared at each other. Elara's hands were still on Catherine's waist—had she meant to let go? When? Catherine's breath smelled like nothing. Not mint, not morning, not food. Nothing. Like someone who'd stopped eating because eating required wanting and wanting required being human.

"Tomorrow," Elara said again. Softer.

Catherine nodded. Stepped back. The space between them felt suddenly vast.

She picked up her gauntlet. Looked at it like it was a dead thing. Didn't put it back on.

"Leave it," Elara said. "I need to study the mechanism. To understand how the threads integrated."

"It's—" Catherine stopped. Started again. "It's worth three years of a soldier's salary. Silver and gold and magic. You could sell it."

"I'm not going to sell it."

"You could."

"I won't."

Catherine held Elara's gaze for a long moment. Then set the gauntlet on the workbench. "Tomorrow. Dawn."

"I'll be here."

Catherine walked to the door. Stopped. Turned back.

"Thank you," she said.

"For what?"

"For trying." Catherine's voice was rough. "Everyone else said it was impossible. That I'd volunteered for the binding and had to live with the consequences. That perfection required sacrifice. You're the first person who's looked at me like I'm worth saving."

Elara's throat was tight. "You are worth saving."

"Why?"

"Because you asked."

It wasn't the whole truth. The whole truth tasted like summer moss and three freckles and the exact temperature at which duty became wanting. But it was true enough for now.

Catherine left.

Elara stood in her forge and listened to the sound of armored footsteps fading down Silver Street. Listened until she couldn't hear them anymore. Then turned back to her workbench.

The gauntlet sat there. Silver and gold. Worth three years of a soldier's salary.

Elara picked it up. Felt its weight. Its truth.

The armor was screaming less now. Still hurting. Still wrong. But quieter. Like it had recognized Elara's gift and was willing to trust her. Like it wanted to be free as much as Catherine did.

Elara set it down. Sketched more diagrams. Planned tomorrow's approach.

Outside, dawn became morning became noon.

Elara worked.

And didn't think about Catherine's hand trembling in hers.

Didn't think about the way Catherine had felt—cold and breakable and brave—when Elara caught her.

Didn't think about summer moss or freckles or the possibility that maybe, just maybe, this was the beginning of something that mattered more than metal.

The church bell tolled three times.

Fifteen hours until dawn.

Elara picked up her hammer and started forging more tools.
