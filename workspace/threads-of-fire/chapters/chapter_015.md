# Chapter 15

Twenty-four hours remaining.

Elara worked without stopping. Thread extraction from Catherine's right foot, twelve hours straight. No breaks. No rest. Catherine screaming through gritted teeth, Elara crying while cutting, both of them pushing past human limits.

Fifteen threads removed. Twenty-five remaining.

Not fast enough.

"Elara," Catherine said. Voice hoarse from controlled screaming. "You need to sleep."

"No time."

"You're shaking. Your hands are shaking."

Elara looked at her hands. Catherine was right—tremor in both, exhaustion-driven, dangerous for precision work.

"One hour," Elara said. "I'll rest one hour."

She collapsed on the floor beside the worktable. Asleep before her head hit ground.

Catherine watched her. Counted her breathing. Thirty-two breaths per minute. Too fast. Stress-elevated.

After exactly one hour, Catherine woke her.

They continued.

---

Day forty-five, midnight: The fever came.

Catherine's temperature spiked. 39°C. Then 40°C. Burning hot, shaking with chills, body fighting the extraction.

"Silver poisoning," Elara said. "The threads are releasing toxins as they're removed. Your body can't process them fast enough."

"Will it kill me?"

"I don't know."

Elara packed Catherine in ice. Monitored temperature. Fed her water despite Catherine vomiting it back.

The fever broke at dawn. Temperature dropped to 37°C. Still elevated but survivable.

"We're stopping today," Elara said. "You need recovery time."

"We don't have recovery time. We have—" Catherine checked the window. Sunlight. "—twelve hours before eviction."

"Then we'll continue extraction somewhere else."

"Where? Every building in Ironhearth belongs to the Council. They'll find us."

Elara had no answer.

They sat in silence. Two women running out of time, out of options, out of safety.

"I could leave," Catherine said quietly. "Go before they come. Take the threads with me. Die somewhere that doesn't cost you everything."

"No."

"Elara—"

"No. We finish this together or not at all."

Catherine was quiet. Then: "You're the most stubborn person I've ever met."

"I learned from watching you."

They smiled at each other. Exhausted. Terrified. Together.

"How many threads left?" Catherine asked.

"Twenty-five. If I work non-stop, I can remove them in—" Elara calculated. "—eighteen hours. Maybe twenty."

"We have twelve."

"Then I work faster."

---

Noon, day forty-five: Elara removed ten threads in six hours.

She was running on adrenaline and desperation. Each thread took less time—not because she was less careful, but because she'd learned shortcuts. Learned where threads anchored, how they resisted, which angle cut fastest.

Catherine stopped screaming. Went silent instead. The silence was worse.

At hour seven, Catherine passed out.

Elara checked her pulse: 45 BPM. Too slow. Dangerously slow.

She stopped working. "Catherine. Wake up."

No response.

"Catherine. I need you conscious. Wake up."

Still nothing.

Elara performed emergency resuscitation. Chest compressions. Rescue breaths. Counting: Thirty compressions, two breaths, repeat.

Catherine's eyes opened on the third cycle.

"Don't die," Elara said. Voice breaking. "Please don't die. I just told you I loved you. You don't get to die now."

Catherine's hand found Elara's. Squeezed weakly. "Still here."

"Good. Stay here."

Elara went back to work. Counted threads: Fifteen remaining. Six hours until eviction.

She could do this.

She had to do this.

---

Hour nine: Twelve threads remaining.

Hour ten: Eight threads remaining.

Hour eleven: Four threads remaining.

Catherine's pulse was 41 BPM. Barely conscious. Skin gray. Breathing shallow.

Dying.

Elara worked faster. Precision gave way to speed. Each thread extracted with mounting desperation.

Three threads. Two threads. One thread.

The final thread was wrapped around Catherine's heel bone, grown into the calcaneous in a way that required breaking bone to extract.

"This is going to hurt," Elara warned.

Catherine couldn't respond. Too weak.

Elara cut. The thread resisted. She pulled harder. The bone cracked.

Catherine screamed.

The thread came free.

Silence.

Catherine's eyes closed. Pulse dropped: 38 BPM. 36 BPM. 34 BPM.

"No," Elara said. "No, no, no. Catherine, wake up. Stay with me."

She performed CPR again. Compressions. Breaths. Counting through tears.

Catherine's heart stuttered. Stopped. Restarted.

32 BPM. Holding.

Not dead. Not alive. Somewhere in between.

Elara bandaged Catherine's feet. All sixty threads removed. Extraction complete. Catherine unconscious, barely breathing, teetering on the edge.

The church bell chimed six times.

Six hours since dawn. Six hours until the Council came to seize the forge.

Elara carried Catherine upstairs. Laid her in bed. Sat beside her. Held her hand.

"You did it," Elara said. "All the threads are gone. You're free. Now wake up. Please wake up."

Catherine didn't wake up.

Her chest rose and fell. Thirty-two breaths per minute. Heartbeat at 32 BPM. Alive but barely.

Elara counted ceiling beams. Fourteen. Counted Catherine's freckles. Seventeen visible on her face. Counted heartbeats. One hundred ninety-two in one hour.

Too few. Too slow.

"I love you," Elara said. "I know I waited too long to say it. I know I was afraid. But I love you. So you have to wake up. You have to be okay. You have to—"

Her voice broke.

Catherine slept. Or didn't sleep. Comatose. Body in shock from extraction, silver poisoning, exhaustion.

Outside, afternoon became evening.

The eviction notice would come at midnight.

Inside, Elara kept vigil.

And prayed to whatever gods listened that Catherine would survive the freedom she'd fought for.
