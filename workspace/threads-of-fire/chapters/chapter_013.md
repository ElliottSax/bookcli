# Chapter 13

Catherine woke to sunlight.

Real sunlight. Not the dim filtered glow that had leaked through helmet gaps for seven years. Full morning sun streaming through the window, warm on her bare face.

She was in Elara's bed. Bare feet tangled in sheets. No armor. No threads. No silver except the scars.

Free.

The previous night came back in fragments: The final sabaton removed. Her first steps on bare feet. Crying. Elara holding her. Sleep.

And now: morning.

Elara wasn't in bed. Catherine sat up—carefully, her feet still ached from relearning balance—and looked around. The room was empty. Sounds drifted up from below: hammer on anvil, the methodical rhythm of work.

Catherine stood. Tested her weight. Left foot, right foot. The bones protested but held. She'd walked fifty steps last night before collapsing exhausted. This morning she'd walk more.

She made it to the stairs. Down. One step at a time, gripping the rail.

Elara was at the forge, working a commission. Didn't notice Catherine at first.

Catherine watched her. Counted without meaning to: Seventeen hammer strikes per minute. Three pauses to check temperature. Five adjustments to the metal's angle. Elara worked with the precision that had saved Catherine's life. Every movement counted. Every action deliberate.

Beautiful.

"You're awake," Elara said without looking up. "How long have you been standing there?"

"Two minutes. How did you know?"

"Your breathing. I've been counting it for thirty-eight days. I know the sound."

Catherine crossed the forge. Uneven steps. Limping. But walking. She stopped beside Elara.

"How do you feel?" Elara asked.

"Free. Terrified. Hungry." Catherine paused. "I don't remember the last time hungry. Not in seven years. The armor suppressed appetite."

"Then we should fix that. Breakfast?"

"Please."

They went upstairs to the small kitchen. Elara made porridge—simple, warm, sweetened with honey. Set a bowl in front of Catherine.

Catherine stared at it.

"What's wrong?" Elara asked.

"I don't know how to do this."

"Eat?"

"Eat for pleasure. Seven years of rations. Food was fuel. Function, not enjoyment. I don't—" She stopped. "I don't know how to want food."

"So relearn. Start small. Taste it. Tell me what you think."

Catherine took a spoonful. The porridge was warm, sweet, textured. Oats and honey and something else—cinnamon maybe.

It was overwhelming.

"Too much?" Elara asked.

"No. Perfect. —" Catherine took another spoonful. "I'd forgotten food could taste like this. Like something worth wanting."

They ate in comfortable silence. Catherine discovered she liked porridge. Liked honey. Liked the way Elara watched her with quiet satisfaction, like teaching Catherine to want food was an accomplishment worth counting.

After breakfast, Elara examined Catherine's feet.

The sabatons had been removed thirty-six hours ago. The wounds were healing but slowly. Silver scars threaded between each toe, wrapped around the arch, marked where threads had been extracted from bone.

"They're deformed," Catherine said, looking at her own feet like they belonged to someone else. "Seven years in too-tight armor compressed the bones. They'll never be normal."

"They'll be functional. That's what matters."

"How long until I can walk without pain?"

"Weeks. Maybe months. The bones need to adjust, the muscles need to rebuild. You're essentially learning to walk again."

"Like a child."

"Like someone who's been bound for seven years and chose freedom anyway."

Catherine smiled. "When you put it that way."

Elara bandaged the feet carefully. Cotton wrapping, precise layers, the same attention to detail she brought to metalwork. When she finished, Catherine's feet looked absurd—wrapped, scarred, human.

"Can I try walking?" Catherine asked.

"Slowly. If it hurts too much, stop."

Catherine stood. Took one step. Her left foot touched ground wrong—too much weight on the outside edge. She shifted. Tried again.

Better.

Second step. Third. She crossed the room. Eight steps. Turned. Eight steps back.

"How many is that?" Elara asked.

"Sixteen total. Fourteen yesterday. Thirty so far today."

"You're counting."

"I learned from the best."

They smiled at each other. The moment felt domestic. Normal. Two people in a room learning each other's patterns.

Then Catherine's expression shifted. "Elara?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you. For everything. For believing the armor could be removed. For not giving up when it got hard. For choosing me over safety. For—" She stopped. The words were there. Three words. Simple. Terrifying. Catherine swallowed them. "For saving my life."

Elara's expression suggested what Catherine hadn't said. But she didn't push. "You're welcome."

The moment passed.

"We should continue the removal," Elara said.

Catherine blinked. "The armor is gone. All of it."

"The plates are gone. The threads are still there. Embedded in your bones. The magic is dormant but active. If we don't extract them completely, they'll keep poisoning you. Slower than before, but still deadly."

Catherine's hands clenched. "How long do I have?"

"Weeks. Maybe two months. The threads will migrate, seeking new anchor points. Eventually they'll reach something vital—heart, lungs, spine. You'll die the same as if you'd kept the armor."

"So we're not done."

"We're not done."

Catherine sat. Processed. "What do we need to do?"

"Surgical extraction. I'll have to cut into your feet, access the metatarsal bones, remove each thread individually. It's more precise than armor removal. More painful. Higher risk."

"Higher risk of what?"

"Permanent nerve damage. Loss of mobility. If I cut wrong, you might never walk properly again."

"And if we don't do it?"

"You die in two months."

Catherine was quiet. Then: "When do we start?"

"Tomorrow. Today you rest. Let your feet heal from the armor removal. Tomorrow we begin extraction."

"How long will it take?"

"A week. Maybe two. Depends on how many threads are embedded, how deep they've grown."

"And after that?"

"After that you're free. Completely. No armor. No threads. No magic. Human."

Catherine stood. Crossed to Elara. Took her hands.

"I'm afraid," Catherine said.

"Of the extraction?"

"Of after. Of being completely human. Of not having the binding as an excuse anymore. If I'm human and I fail, it's because I'm weak. Not because the armor limited me. It's—" She stopped. "Terrifying. Being responsible for my own failures."

"You've been responsible all along. The armor didn't make choices. You did."

"But it felt different. Now I have to own it. Own who I am without magic. Without enhancement. Own being ordinary."

"You're not ordinary."

"How do you know?"

"Because ordinary people don't survive seven years of binding. Ordinary people don't choose freedom over duty. Ordinary people don't relearn to walk and laugh about making terrible soup and count heartbeats like prayer." Elara squeezed Catherine's hands. "You're extraordinary. With or without armor."

Catherine pulled Elara close. Kissed her. Soft. Grateful.

"I love you," Catherine said.

The words were out before she could swallow them. Three words. Simple. Terrifying. True.

Elara froze. "Catherine—"

"You don't have to say it back. I know it's fast. I know we've only had thirty-eight days. I know there are a thousand reasons this is too soon. But I needed to say it. Before the extraction. Before whatever comes next. I needed you to know: I love you. Not because you saved me. Not because I'm grateful. Because you count ceiling beams when anxious and organize tools when overwhelmed and make terrible jokes to lighten tension. Because you asked before kissing. Because you chose me when it was dangerous. I love you."

Elara's eyes were wet. "I can't—"

"You don't have to. I needed to say it."

"No, I mean—" Elara stopped. Started again. "I can't say it back yet. Not because I don't feel it. But because saying it makes it real. Makes it something that can be lost. And I'm terrified of losing you. If I say I love you and then the extraction fails, or the kingdoms come, or something goes wrong—I don't know if I can survive that."

"So you're protecting yourself."

"Yes. Is that selfish?"

"No. It's human." Catherine smiled. Sad. Understanding. "Take your time. I'll still be here."

They held each other for a long moment. Two women learning to build something neither was sure would last.

"Tomorrow," Elara said. "We start extraction tomorrow."

"Tomorrow," Catherine agreed.

That night Catherine slept fitfully. Not nightmares. Anxiety. The weight of what came next.

Elara stayed awake. Kept watch. Counted Catherine's heartbeats. Seventy-two per minute. Human normal.

And thought about three words she was too afraid to say.
