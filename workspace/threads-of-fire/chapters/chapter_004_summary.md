# Chapter 4 Summary

**Word count**: ~3,600 words

**Key events**:
- Week one complete: Right arm fully exposed (gauntlet and vambrace removed)
- Catherine can feel heat again in her right hand—overwhelmed by sensation
- Elara teaches Catherine to work metal, gives her simple task: shaping horseshoe
- Catherine's first hammer strike in 7 years without armor assistance
- She's weak—armor has been doing the work, her muscles have atrophied
- Breaks down crying at the realization of how much she's lost
- Elara holds her, lets her cry (first sustained physical comfort Catherine's had in years)

**Character development**:
- Catherine's vulnerability increasing: Allows herself to cry, to be held
- Elara's protective instinct emerging: Wants to shield Catherine from all pain
- Role reversal: The "perfect knight" being comforted by the blacksmith
- Catherine admits she's afraid—of dying, of living, of wanting things again
- Temperature detail: Catherine's exposed arm now 34°C (warming up)

**Armor removal progress**:
- Right arm: 100% complete
- Estimated time to full removal: 5-6 weeks
- Catherine's deadline: 5 weeks remaining
- It's going to be close

**Subplots**:
- Elara's father visits forge, sees Catherine, disapproves
- "Don't get attached to someone who's leaving" (he's talking about more than armor removal)
- Elara realizes: She's already attached
- First acknowledgment (to herself) that this is attraction, not just professional care

**Emotional beats**:
- Catherine's first laugh (short, rusty, but real)
- Triggered by Elara's terrible joke about metalwork
- Sound makes Elara's heart skip
- Both pretend not to notice the effect

**Quality focus**: Voice distinctiveness (Elara's humor, Catherine's soldier-speak softening)
