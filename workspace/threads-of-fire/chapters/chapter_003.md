# Chapter 3

Catherine came back.

That was the first surprise. The second was that she came back on time—six o'clock precisely, the church bell still echoing its final chime when she stepped through the forge door. The third surprise was that she looked worse.

Elara had cataloged Catherine's appearance two days ago: 32°C skin temperature, fine lines at eye corners suggesting exhaustion, 178cm height, summer moss eyes. Today she added: darker shadows under those eyes (purple-grey, like old bruising), slight tremor in left hand (0.6 seconds duration, worse than before), visible tension in jaw muscles (grinding teeth, probably unconscious).

"You didn't sleep," Elara said.

"Good morning to you too."

"It's not a good morning if you didn't sleep."

Catherine shrugged with her right shoulder—the one still fully armored. The left hung differently now without the gauntlet, unbalanced, like a tree that had lost a major branch and hadn't learned to compensate. "I don't sleep."

"You said that before. I didn't believe it then either."

"Belief isn't required." Catherine crossed to the workbench where her gauntlet sat, surrounded by Elara's sketches. She studied the diagrams without touching them. "You've been busy."

Elara had been busy. Fifteen hours of work. Three failed probe designs, two successful ones. Seventeen pages of anatomical sketches mapping thread placement. Four different theories about removal sequencing, three of which would kill Catherine, one of which might not.

"I think I can remove the vambrace," Elara said. "Not today. But soon."

"How soon?"

"Week. Maybe two."

Catherine's hand—the pale one, the naked one—curled into a fist. "How many more threads before then?"

"Eight. Maybe twelve if you can handle it."

"I can handle it."

"You screamed yesterday."

"I controlled it."

"A controlled scream is still a scream."

Catherine turned to face her. In the early morning light slanting through the forge windows, her eyes looked less like summer moss and more like winter grass—something dormant, waiting for warmth it didn't expect. "How many people have you watched die?"

The question landed wrong. Sharp. Like a blade hitting at an angle that cut deeper than intended.

"One," Elara said.

"Then you know. Pain is information. Information can be managed."

"Pain is also your body telling you to stop."

"My body's been telling me to stop for seven years." Catherine's voice was flat. Soldier-flat. The voice of someone who'd made a decision and wouldn't be argued out of it. "I stopped listening."

Elara counted to five. Breathed. Tried again. "If we push too hard, the threads could sever wrong. Could cut through an artery instead of away from it. Could kill you faster than the armor will."

"Noted."

"That's not—"

"I understand the risks. I'm choosing to take them." Catherine sat on the stool—same one as yesterday, adjusted to the same height, positioned at the same angle. Her posture was perfect. Military-straight. The posture of someone who'd learned that perfection meant survival. "Three threads minimum today. More if possible."

"You're not in charge here."

"Neither are you. The armor is." Catherine extended her bare arm. "So let's see what it has to say."

Elara wanted to argue. Wanted to point out that Catherine's hand was trembling again, that her jaw was clenched hard enough to crack teeth, that her breathing was too controlled which meant she was in more pain than she'd admit. Wanted to say *slow down* and *be careful* and *let me protect you from yourself*.

Instead she picked up her tools.

In the forge, metal didn't lie. Metal told the truth even when people wouldn't. And Catherine's armor was screaming louder than yesterday despite Elara's work. Which meant Catherine was dying faster than the six-to-eight-week projection. Which meant they didn't have time to go slow.

"Three threads," Elara agreed. "But if you pass out, we're done for the day."

"Deal."

They weren't going to shake on it. Catherine's right hand was still gauntleted, and Elara was already touching her left, fingers against the inside of Catherine's wrist, feeling for the pulse point.

62 beats per minute. Same as yesterday. Too slow, too controlled, a heart that had forgotten normal.

Elara counted to one hundred. Sixty-two beats in that time. Mathematically perfect. Medically wrong.

"You're doing it again," Catherine said.

"Doing what?"

"Counting."

"I always count."

"Why?"

Because counting was easier than feeling. Because numbers didn't lie the way emotions did. Because if she counted heartbeats and temperature and thread placements then she didn't have to count how many times she'd thought about Catherine's hand in hers, or how many hours until Catherine came back, or how many ways this could end badly.

"Helps me focus," Elara said.

She didn't mention that she'd counted ceiling beams for three hours last night instead of sleeping. Didn't mention that she'd added a new category to her Catherine catalog: *Number of times I've replayed her saying 'thank you': seventeen.*

Elara positioned the probe against the second thread—this one thicker than yesterday's, woven more deeply into the muscle tissue of Catherine's forearm. The armor was quieter here. Still screaming, but at a lower frequency. Like it hurt less. Or like Catherine had gone numb to this particular pain.

"This will be worse than yesterday," Elara warned.

"Everything is worse than yesterday. That's how time works."

"That's bleak."

"That's military service."

Elara cut.

The thread resisted. Clung. Had to be teased away from Catherine's radial artery with the precision that required not breathing, not blinking, not thinking about anything except the microscopic gap between silver and vein.

Catherine made a sound. Not a scream. Lower. Subvocal. The sound of someone who'd learned that screaming didn't help but couldn't stay completely silent.

Elara kept working. Hands steady despite her heart doing something erratic that had nothing to do with forge heat and everything to do with Catherine's pain.

The thread came free.

Catherine exhaled. It took six seconds. Too controlled. Mathematical again.

"One," Elara said.

"How long did that take?"

Elara glanced at the clock. "Forty-three minutes."

"We can do faster."

"We're not doing faster."

"At this rate—"

"At this rate you'll survive. Fast gets you dead." Elara set the thread aside—she'd been collecting them, studying their structure, trying to understand how magic could grow into human tissue like roots into soil. "Two more. Then we break."

Catherine nodded.

The second thread took thirty-eight minutes. Catherine was quieter during this one. Too quiet. Her skin temperature had dropped—Elara checked between probe adjustments. 31°C. One degree colder than yesterday. Hypothermia territory.

"You're freezing," Elara said.

"I know."

"Why didn't you say something?"

"What would you do about it?"

Fair point. Elara couldn't warm Catherine up without stopping the work. Couldn't stop the work without wasting the time Catherine had already endured. Couldn't waste time when Catherine had weeks instead of months.

"After this thread," Elara said. "We stop for fifteen minutes. I'll build up the forge. You'll warm up."

"That's inefficient."

"That's survival."

The thread came free. Catherine's Their breath came short and fast—sharp, involuntary, human. The first sound she'd made that wasn't controlled.

Elara caught her before she fell.

This was becoming a pattern. Catherine in Elara's arms, cold and shaking and lighter than someone in full armor should be. The armor had weight but Catherine didn't. Like she'd been carved hollow by seven years of not eating, not sleeping, not wanting anything except to be perfect.

"Fifteen minutes," Elara said into Catherine's hair. It smelled like nothing. Same as her breath. Like someone who'd stopped doing the small human things that created scent. "Then we'll do the third thread."

"I'm fine."

"You're hypothermic and shaking and you nearly collapsed."

"Nearly isn't the same as did."

"Catherine." Elara pulled back. Met those summer-moss-winter-grass eyes. "I need you to tell me when it's too much."

"It's never too much."

"That's not sustainable."

"I don't need to sustain it. I need to survive it." Catherine's voice cracked on the last word. . enough to prove she was human under all that armor. "Do you know why I volunteered for the binding?"

Elara shook her head.

"I had a sister. Younger. Eleven years old. Mara." Catherine said the name like it hurt. "Border raid. Seven years ago. I was nineteen and training to be a knight and I was supposed to protect the village. Supposed to keep watch. I didn't. I was—" She stopped. Started again. "I was with someone. A girl from the village. We were in the hayloft and I wasn't watching and when the raid happened I was too far away to—"

Catherine stopped talking. Her jaw worked. Teeth grinding.

Elara waited.

"She died," Catherine finally said. "Mara. She was hiding in the granary and they set it on fire and I got there too late. I could hear her screaming and I couldn't—the door was barred from outside and I couldn't break it fast enough and by the time I did—"

She stopped again.

Elara's throat was tight. this story. Knew the shape of it. Knew what it felt like to be too slow, too weak, too human to save someone who needed saving.

"I volunteered for the binding three days later," Catherine continued. Her voice was flat again. Controlled. "Told them I wanted to be strong enough that it would never happen again. Strong enough to protect everyone. Strong enough to be perfect."

"You were nineteen," Elara said. "It wasn't your fault."

"Belief isn't required."

Catherine used Elara's own words back at her. It should have felt sharp. Instead it felt like recognition. Like Catherine understood that guilt didn't respond to logic.

"I killed my mother," Elara said.

Catherine blinked. "What?"

"My mother. Eight years ago. I was sixteen. She was teaching me to work with higher-temperature metals—chromium, tungsten, the ones that need fifteen hundred degrees. I set up the forge wrong. Temperature spiked. There was an explosion. She—" Elara's hands were shaking. She curled them into fists. "She pushed me out of the way. Took the blast herself. By the time my father got there she was already—"

Dead. Melted. Screaming. All of those and none of those because what happened at fifteen hundred thirty-eight degrees Celsius wasn't something that had words.

"It was an accident," Catherine said.

"I know."

"You were sixteen. You were learning."

"I know that too."

"But you still think it was your fault."

"Every day."

They looked at each other. Two women carved hollow by guilt. Two survivors who'd convinced themselves they were killers. Two people who'd built walls so high they'd forgotten what warmth felt like.

Catherine's hand—the bare one, the cold one—reached up. Touched Elara's face. Traced the line of the burn scar that ran from Elara's left eyebrow down to her jaw. The scar she'd gotten from the explosion. The one she counted every morning. Eighteen centimeters long, 4mm wide at the widest point, 1.2mm at the narrowest.

"Does it still hurt?" Catherine asked.

"Every day," Elara said.

She meant the scar. She meant the memory. She meant the guilt that had worked its way into her the same way silver had worked into Catherine—threads woven so deep that removal would require excavating bone.

Catherine's thumb traced lower. Found the burn scars on Elara's hands. The small ones from forge work. Elara had counted these too. Forty-three on her right hand, thirty-seven on her left. Each one a date, a mistake, a lesson learned.

"We match," Catherine said softly. "You have scars on the outside. I have them on the inside."

"Silver veins?"

"Guilt."

Elara's Their breath came short and fast.

Catherine dropped her hand. Looked away. "I should warm up. You said fifteen minutes."

"Right. Yes." Elara stepped back. Tried to remember how to be professional. How to treat Catherine like a client instead of like someone whose pain she wanted to catalog and carry. "Sit by the forge. I'll build it up."

She fed the forge. Watched the temperature climb. Three hundred degrees. Five hundred. Eight hundred. The fire turned orange, then yellow, then white at the edges.

Catherine sat close enough to be warm but not close enough to burn. Her skin temperature would be rising—Elara wanted to check, wanted to confirm, wanted an excuse to touch Catherine's wrist again and count heartbeats and confirm she was still alive.

Instead she counted bricks. Same as always. Forty-seven across, twenty-three high, one thousand eighty-one total.

"Why do you do that?" Catherine asked.

"Do what?"

"Count things. I've watched you. You count tools. Count ceiling beams. Count your own heartbeats. Why?"

Because chaos was the enemy. Because her mother had died when Elara lost count of temperature. Because if she counted everything then maybe she could control something.

"Helps me think," Elara said.

"Or helps you not think."

Too perceptive. Elara didn't answer.

"I count too," Catherine admitted. "Breaths. Heartbeats. Steps. Days. Everything that proves I'm still alive."

"How many days have you had the armor?"

"Two thousand five hundred fifty-seven."

Immediate answer. No hesitation. Catherine had been counting.

"How many days do you think you have left?" Elara asked.

"Fewer than I want. More than I deserve."

The fifteen minutes passed. Elara checked Catherine's temperature—hand to forehead, professional, clinical, trying not to notice the way Catherine's eyes tracked her movement.

32°C. One degree warmer. Still hypothermic but improving.

"Third thread," Elara said.

This one took an hour. Not because it was harder but because Elara worked slower. More carefully. Catherine had gone quiet again but it was a different quiet. Less controlled. More exhausted.

When the third thread came free, Catherine didn't make a sound. Didn't move. sat there with her eyes closed and her breathing too shallow.

"Done for today," Elara said.

"We could do more."

"We're done."

"I can—"

"Catherine. Look at your hand."

Catherine opened her eyes. Looked at her left arm. At the three new wounds where threads had been removed. At the silver veining visible beneath pale skin. At the way her fingers trembled despite her attempts at control.

"You're right," Catherine said quietly. "We're done."

Elara bandaged the wounds. Clean cotton strips, competent wrapping, trying not to notice how Catherine's skin felt against hers. Trying not to catalog the temperature (32.4°C, warming), the texture (soft despite seven years in armor), the way Catherine held perfectly still like Elara's touch was something to be endured instead of felt.

"The vambrace," Elara said as she tied off the last bandage. "I think you can remove it yourself. With guidance."

Catherine looked at the forearm armor. It had been part of her for seven years. Part of her identity. Part of the prison she'd built from guilt.

"When?" Catherine asked.

"Now. If you want."

"Will it hurt?"

"Yes."

"More than the threads?"

"Different. The threads are surgical. The vambrace removal is—" Elara searched for the word. "—voluntary. You'll be choosing the pain instead of enduring it."

Catherine was quiet for a long moment. Then she nodded. "Tell me what to do."

Elara guided her through it. Explained the mechanism—how the armor was designed to be unstrapped in a specific sequence, how seven years of wear had fused some clasps, how Catherine would need to break her own armor to be free of it.

"Here," Elara said, positioning Catherine's right hand on the first clasp. "Quarter-turn clockwise. Then pull."

Catherine turned. Pulled. The clasp broke with a sound like bone cracking.

She didn't flinch.

Second clasp. Third. Fourth. Each one breaking. Each one a choice to hurt now instead of dying slow.

The vambrace came free.

Catherine's forearm was bare.

Elara had seen sketches. Had mapped the threads. Had theorized about what would be beneath the armor. Theory wasn't preparation.

Catherine's skin was paper-pale. Not pale. Translucent. Elara could see the veins—twelve major ones running from wrist to elbow, each one threaded with silver. Could see the scars from old battles—three of them, faded white against white skin. Could see the exact places where magic had grown into muscle.

Could see that Catherine was beautiful and broken and terrifyingly fragile.

"How bad is it?" Catherine asked. She wasn't looking. Couldn't look. Or wouldn't.

"Manageable," Elara said.

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer I have."

Elara counted without meaning to. Forty-seven silver threads visible in Catherine's forearm. Twelve major veins. Three battle scars. Two hundred sixty-three freckles scattered from wrist to elbow (more than the three on Catherine's hand—Ursa Minor pattern repeated in smaller constellations).

Catherine was watching her. "You're counting again."

"I'm always counting."

"What's the count?"

"Forty-seven threads. We've removed three. Forty-four to go in your forearm alone."

"How long?"

"Two weeks. Maybe three."

"And then?"

"Upper arm. Shoulder. Chest. Back." Elara met Catherine's eyes. "Months. If we're careful. If we're lucky."

"I'm not lucky."

"Neither am I."

They were still close. Elara's hands on Catherine's arm. Catherine's breath warming the air between them. The forge fire behind them casting shadows that made Catherine's silver veins look like jewelry instead of poison.

"Same time tomorrow?" Catherine asked.

"Same time."

Catherine stood. Started to reach for the vambrace—stopped. Looked at her bare arm like it belonged to someone else.

"I can't wear it anymore," she said. "Can I."

"No."

"People will see."

"Yes."

"They'll know I'm dying."

"They'll know you're trying to live." Elara picked up the vambrace. Set it next to the gauntlet. "Leave it. Both pieces. I need to study the integration patterns."

Catherine nodded. Flexed her bare fingers. Both hands naked now. Both hands human.

She looked smaller without the armor. More fragile. More real.

"Thank you," Catherine said.

"For what?"

"For understanding." Catherine's voice was soft. "About Mara. About the guilt. Most people tell me it wasn't my fault. You didn't."

"Because it doesn't help."

"No. It doesn't."

Catherine left. Elara listened to her footsteps—lighter now without the gauntlet and vambrace, less armored, more vulnerable. Listened until she couldn't hear them anymore.

Then she turned back to her workbench.

Two pieces of armor. Three extracted threads in a glass vial. Forty-seven more to go. Months of work. Weeks of pain. Days Catherine might not have.

Elara picked up the vambrace. Felt its weight. Its truth.

The armor was quieter now. Still screaming but softer. Like it recognized that removal had started and was willing to cooperate. Like it wanted Catherine to survive as much as Elara did.

Elara set it down. Started sketching the next phase.

Outside, morning became afternoon.

Inside, Elara worked and counted and tried not to think about silver veins and freckles and the exact temperature at which guilt became something else.

Something that tasted like hope.
