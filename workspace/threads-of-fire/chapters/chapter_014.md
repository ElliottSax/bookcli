# Chapter 14

The spy came back on day forty.

Elara was in the market buying supplies when him—same man as three days ago, different clothes but same posture. Watching. Following at a distance of exactly twenty meters.

She counted: Twenty-three steps to the leather merchant. Spy follows. Seventeen steps to the herb stall. Spy follows. Thirty-one steps back toward the forge. Spy follows.

Professional surveillance.

Elara changed tactics. Led him on a winding route through Ironhearth's narrow streets. Market to bakery to cooper's shop to tanner's yard. Two kilometers. Forty-seven minutes.

The spy followed the entire time.

When Elara finally returned to the forge, her father was waiting outside.

Thomas Thorne looked older than he had a week ago. More tired. The tired that came from worry.

"We need to talk," he said.

"About?"

"About the fact that you're sleeping with Eldergard's most wanted deserter."

Elara's hands clenched on the supply bag. "How do you—"

"The Council knows. The spies reported it. Dame Valois was seen entering your bedroom. Multiple nights. Staying until dawn." Thomas's expression was neutral. Professional. The look he used for difficult conversations. "Is it true?"

Elara could lie. Should lie. Lying would protect Catherine, protect the forge, protect everything they'd built.

"Yes," Elara said. "It's true."

Thomas nodded. Like he'd expected the answer. "Are you in love with her?"

"That's none of your—"

"Are you in love with her?"

Elara met her father's eyes. "Yes."

"Does she feel the same?"

"She says she does."

"And you believe her?"

"Yes."

Thomas was quiet for a long moment. "Then you're a fool."

"Excuse me?"

"She's using you, Elara. Can't you see that? She needed armor removed. You removed it. Now she's staying in your bed because she has nowhere else to go. The moment she's fully healed, the moment the kingdoms stop hunting her, she'll leave."

"You don't know that."

"I know people. I know how survival works. She's doing what she needs to survive. That includes making you believe she loves you."

"You're wrong."

"Am I? Or are you so desperate to save someone—to not fail like you failed your mother—that you'll believe anything?"

The words landed like a hammer strike. Elara stepped back.

Thomas continued, voice gentler but still cutting. "your mother die. you blame yourself. you spend eight years trying to prove you could save someone. And now you've found someone who needs saving and you think that's love. But it's not love, Elara. It's guilt dressed up as romance."

"You don't know what you're talking about."

"Don't I? Tell me: Would you feel the same about her if you hadn't saved her? If she'd walked in healthy, would you still want her?"

Elara had no answer.

"That's what I thought." Thomas picked up his tool bag. "The Council is meeting tomorrow. They're going to ask you to hand over Dame Valois. If you refuse, they'll revoke your forge license. You'll lose everything."

"Then I'll lose everything."

"Elara—"

"I'm not handing her over. She'll die if I do. I won't—" Her voice cracked. "I won't watch someone else die because I was too afraid to fight for them."

Thomas looked at her for a long moment. "You're your mother's daughter. Brave and stubborn and willing to burn for people who won't do the same for you."

He left.

Elara stood outside the forge, supply bag in hand, watching her father walk away.

Counted: Forty-seven steps before he turned the corner. Sixty-three heartbeats raise. Three deep breaths to stop shaking.

Then she went inside.

Catherine was upstairs, sitting on the bed, looking out the window. She turned when Elara entered.

"I heard," Catherine said. "The walls are thin. everything."

"How much?"

"Enough. Your father thinks I'm using you. The Council is moving against you. You'll lose your forge if you don't hand me over." Catherine stood. Limped across the room. "I should leave."

"No."

"Elara, you're losing everything because of me. Your forge, your father's respect, your reputation. I can't—"

"You can. You are. And I'm choosing it anyway." Elara crossed to her. "I don't care what the Council says. I don't care what my father thinks. I care about you. About keeping you alive."

"But he's right, isn't he?" Catherine's voice was small. "You saved me. You feel responsible. Maybe that's not love. Maybe it's guilt."

"It's not guilt."

"How do you know?"

"Because guilt feels like burning. This feels like—" Elara stopped. Searched for words. "Like counting your heartbeats and wanting them to keep going. Like watching you walk and feeling proud. Like being terrified of losing you not because I failed but because you matter. That's not guilt. That's—"

She stopped. The word was there. Three syllables. Terrifying.

"That's love," Catherine finished quietly. "Isn't it?"

Elara couldn't say it. Couldn't make it real. But she could show it.

She kissed Catherine. Soft. Certain. The kiss of someone who'd made a choice and wouldn't unmake it.

"Stay," Elara said when they pulled apart. "Whatever comes next, stay."

"Even if it costs you everything?"

"Everything except you is replaceable."

Catherine's eyes were wet. "I don't deserve you."

"Good thing love isn't about deserving."

They held each other. Two women building something fragile in a world determined to break it.

Outside, the spy watched. Took notes. Reported back.

Inside, they didn't care.

Day forty-one: The extraction began.

Catherine lay face-down on the worktable. Both feet exposed. Elara had numbed them as much as possible—herbs, ice, pressure points. But the pain would come anyway.

"Ready?" Elara asked.

"No. Do it anyway."

Elara made the first incision. Small. Precise. A line along Catherine's left foot arch, exposing the first metatarsal bone.

Catherine made a sound. Low. Controlled.

The thread was visible now—silver wrapped around bone like a parasite. Elara used the finest probe, slipping it between thread and bone.

The thread didn't want to release. Had grown into the bone over seven years, fused at a cellular level. Elara had to scrape. Gently. Microscopically.

Catherine's hands gripped the table. Wood cracked.

First thread: Forty-seven minutes.

When it came free, Catherine was shaking.

"Break?" Elara asked.

"No. Keep going. If we stop now, I'll lose my nerve."

Second thread. Third. Fourth.

Three hours in, Elara had removed four threads from Catherine's left foot. Fourteen remained visible. More were deeper, wrapped around bones Elara couldn't access without major surgery.

"How many total?" Catherine asked. Voice rough from controlled screaming.

"In your left foot? Maybe thirty. In your right? Same. Total: Sixty threads."

"And you can remove them all?"

"I can try."

"That's not a yes."

"It's the best I can offer."

Catherine was quiet. Then: "Keep going."

They worked until nightfall. Eight threads removed from the left foot. Catherine was gray with pain, shaking, barely conscious.

"Done for today," Elara said.

"But—"

"Done. You need rest. The extraction will take days. Weeks. We're not doing it all at once."

She cleaned Catherine's foot. Bandaged it. Helped her upstairs to bed.

Catherine collapsed. Asleep within minutes.

Elara stayed awake. Stared at the eight threads in a vial. So small. So deadly. Sixty more to go.

Two weeks minimum at this pace. If Catherine could handle it. If complications didn't arise. If the kingdoms didn't come first.

Too many ifs.

Elara counted them: Fourteen different ways this could fail. Three ways it could succeed. The odds were bad.

But she'd work with bad odds before.

Day forty-three: The Council summoned Elara.

Same courthouse. Same five councilors. Different energy—hostile where before it had been merely concerned.

"Mistress Thorne," Merchant Voss said. "You were instructed to encourage Dame Valois to leave. She's still here."

"She's receiving medical treatment."

"She's received enough. The armor is removed. She can leave."

"The threads are still embedded. Extraction takes weeks."

"Unacceptable. War has been declared. Argentum crossed the border this morning. Eldergard is mobilizing in response. Ferrum is caught between them. We need Dame Valois gone before one of the kingdoms decides she's a strategic asset worth fighting over."

Elara's chest tightened. "War? As of when?"

"As of dawn. Three people died in border skirmishes. More will follow." Captain Rourke leaned forward. "Dame Valois is a catalyst. Both kingdoms want her. Eldergard to punish desertion. Argentum to use against Eldergard. Her presence in Ironhearth makes us a target."

"She can't leave. She'll die without complete extraction."

"Then she dies," Minister Chen said flatly. "Better one death than thousands."

"You're asking me to kill her."

"We're asking you to choose: One woman's life, or your city's safety."

Elara stood. "I choose her."

"Then we revoke your license. Effective immediately. You have forty-eight hours to clear your forge."

"You can't—"

"We can. We are. Forty-eight hours, Mistress Thorne. After that, the forge is seized."

They dismissed her.

Elara walked back to the forge in a daze. Counted steps. Four hundred nineteen. Counted heartbeats. Two hundred seventy-three. Counted hours until eviction. Forty-eight.

Catherine was waiting when she returned. Still limping. Still healing. But awake.

"Bad news?" Catherine asked.

"War was declared. The Council revoked my license. We have forty-eight hours before they seize the forge."

Catherine's expression didn't change. "Because of me."

"Because of their cowardice."

"Elara, you're losing your home. Your livelihood. Everything. Because of me."

"I know."

"And you're still choosing me?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

Elara crossed to her. Took her hands. "Because forty-eight hours ago you told me you loved me. Because this morning you endured three hours of extraction without complaint. Because you're brave and stubborn and learning to want things. Because I—"

The words caught. Three syllables. Terrifying.

"Because I love you," Elara said.

Catherine froze. "You said you couldn't—"

"I was wrong. I can. I do. I love you." Elara's voice was steady despite her hands shaking. "I love you and I'm losing my forge and war is coming and I don't care because you're more important than all of it."

Catherine kissed her. Desperate. Grateful. Perfect.

When they pulled apart, both were crying.

"What do we do now?" Catherine asked.

"Now we finish the extraction. We have forty-eight hours. Let's use them."

They worked through the night. Removed twelve more threads from Catherine's left foot. Started on the right.

Progress was slow. Painful. Necessary.

By dawn on day forty-four, twenty threads removed. Forty remaining.

Not fast enough.

But they were trying.

That had to be enough.
