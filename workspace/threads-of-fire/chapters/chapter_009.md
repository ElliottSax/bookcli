# Chapter 9

The kiss wasn't gentle.

It was desperate. Urgent. Seven years of touch-starvation meeting three years of loneliness. Seven years of Catherine learning not to want meeting three years of Elara learning not to care.

Catherine's hands came up to Elara's face—both hands, bare and warm and trembling. Her fingers traced Elara's burn scar, the line from eyebrow to jaw, counting it the way Elara counted everything.

Elara's hands found Catherine's waist. Careful of the bandages still wrapped around her torso. Careful of the wounds that hadn't fully healed.

They pulled apart. Foreheads pressed together. Both breathing hard.

"That was—" Catherine stopped. Tried again. "I don't have words for that."

"Good or bad?"

"Terrifying. Perfect. Both."

Elara's hands were shaking. When had they started shaking? She didn't shake. She worked with fire and metal and precision tools. Steady hands were survival.

But Catherine made her shake.

"Again?" Elara asked.

"Yes."

The second kiss was slower. Gentler. Learning instead of claiming. Catherine's lips were warm—36°C, nearly human normal. Her breath tasted like bread and cheese and something metallic underneath. Silver. The binding had changed even this.

They kissed until breathing became difficult. Until Catherine swayed on her feet. Until Elara remembered that Catherine had major surgery twelve days ago and probably shouldn't be standing.

"Bed," Elara said. "You need to rest."

"I don't want to rest. I want this."

"You can have both."

Elara guided Catherine to the bed. Sat her down. Catherine pulled Elara down beside her.

They lay facing each other. Close but not touching. The distance felt intentional.

"I've never done this before," Catherine said.

"Kissed someone?"

"No. I've kissed. Before the binding. But I've never—" She gestured vaguely. "This. After wanting someone. With someone who wanted me back. When it mattered."

"It mattered before."

"Not like this. Before I was nineteen and stupid and thought I had forever. Now I know better. Now every moment feels borrowed."

Elara's throat was tight. "You're not dying anymore. The armor's coming off. Your heart is healing."

"I'm still a deserter being hunted by two kingdoms. Still a political liability who could start a war. Still someone with an expiration date."

"Everyone has an expiration date."

"Mine is more immediate than most."

Elara counted the freckles on Catherine's face. Seventeen visible. More than the three on her hand. Ursa Minor constellation repeated in miniature across her cheekbones.

"Then we'll make the borrowed moments count," Elara said.

Catherine's hand found Elara's. Laced their fingers together.

They fell asleep like that.

---

Elara woke to Catherine screaming again.

Same nightmare. Same panic. Catherine sitting up, hands clutching at armor that wasn't there, eyes unseeing.

"Catherine. Count with me."

This time Catherine heard faster. Found her pulse. Counted.

"Eighty-two. Eighty-one. Eighty. Seventy-nine."

"Good. Keep going."

When Catherine's heartbeat dropped to seventy, she looked at Elara. Really looked.

"I'm sorry," she said.

"Don't apologize for nightmares."

"I woke you."

"I was going to wake up anyway. The forge needs banking."

It was a lie. The forge was fine. But Catherine's expression eased.

"Can I come with you?" Catherine asked.

"You should sleep."

"I can't. Not after—" She gestured at herself. At the sweat-soaked nightshirt. At the trembling hands. "Not yet."

"Okay. Come."

They went downstairs together. Elara banked the forge, Catherine watched. The routine was soothing. Familiar. Count coals. Add wood. Adjust airflow. Monitor temperature. Three hundred degrees. Two hundred. One hundred.

Safe levels for overnight.

"Can I try something?" Catherine asked.

"Try what?"

"Metal work. You taught me before. With the terrible bent piece. I want to try again."

"It's three in the morning."

"I'm not sleeping anyway."

Elara retrieved iron stock. Heated it. Handed Catherine the two-kilogram hammer.

Catherine took it. Her hand still trembled slightly—but from nightmares, not weakness. Three weeks of eating properly, sleeping properly, living properly had rebuilt some muscle.

She struck the iron.

Better than before. The dent was deeper. More controlled.

"Again," Elara said.

Catherine struck. Again. Again. Each hit landing more solidly. Each hit proof that she was getting stronger.

After twenty strikes, the iron had taken shape. Not a horseshoe. Not anything useful. But less terrible than the first attempt.

Catherine set down the hammer. Looked at her work.

"Still terrible," she said.

"Aggressively terrible."

"The iron still hates me."

"Probably."

They smiled at each other.

And Catherine's hand went to her neck. Flinched.

"What's wrong?" Elara asked.

"The neck armor. I can feel it. Now that the helmet's gone, the collar is exposed. It's—" She stopped. Touched her neck again. "It hurts. More than before. Like now that the helmet's off, I can feel what was always there."

Elara crossed to her. "Show me."

Catherine tilted her head back. The gorget—the neck armor—was still in place. Wrapped around her throat like a collar. Silver threads visible at the edges, disappearing under skin.

Elara touched it gently. Catherine flinched.

"How long has it been hurting?"

"Since the helmet came off. Three days. It's getting worse."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"I thought it would pass. Everything hurts when you first remove a piece. This felt—" She stopped. "Normal."

"This isn't normal placement pain. The threads are constricting. Probably compensating for the missing helmet weight."

"Can you remove it?"

"Yes. But not tonight. It's complex. Threads wrapped around your spine and trachea. One wrong cut and you stop breathing or lose nerve function." Elara met her eyes. "We do this carefully. In daylight. When both of us are rested."

"But you can do it?"

"I can do it."

Catherine nodded. Trusted.

They went back upstairs. Both lay down. Close but not touching. Two separate people in one small bed learning to share space.

"Elara?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you. For the kiss. For not pushing for more. For letting me learn this at my own pace."

"You're worth waiting for."

"Am I?"

"Yes."

Catherine's hand found Elara's again. They fell asleep counting each other's heartbeats.

---

Day twenty-one. Three weeks since Catherine first walked into the forge.

The neck armor removal took six hours.

The threads were wrapped around Catherine's cervical spine—the seven vertebrae supporting her head. Wrapped around her trachea, her esophagus, her carotid arteries. Removing them required cutting between heartbeats, between breaths, between nerve clusters.

One mistake and Catherine would be paralyzed. Or suffocate. Or bleed out.

Elara's hands were steady. They had to be.

"Talk to me," Elara said. "Keep talking so I know you're conscious."

"About what?"

"Anything. Tell me about before the binding."

Catherine was lying face-down on the worktable. Her voice was muffled. "Before the binding I was a squire. Training to be a knight. I was good at swordwork, terrible at diplomacy. My commander said I had talent but no restraint."

"Sounds familiar."

"I was also in love with someone. A girl from the village. Merchant's daughter. Her name was Senna."

Elara's hand stilled on the probe. "What happened to her?"

"I don't know. When I volunteered for the binding, they told me attachments were forbidden. That binding required complete focus. I never saw her again."

"Did you love her?"

"I thought I did. Now I think I loved the idea of her. The way nineteen-year-olds love—intense and shallow and certain it will last forever." Catherine was quiet while Elara removed another thread. Then: "It's different now."

"What's different?"

"The way I feel about you. It's not shallow. It's not certain. It's terrifying and complicated and I don't know if it will last past tomorrow. But it's real. More real than anything I felt before."

Elara's throat was tight. "Is this your way of telling me you have feelings for me?"

"Is it working?"

"Yes."

"Good. Because I don't know how else to say it. I'm terrible at this. At feelings. At words. At being human."

"You're learning."

"I'm trying."

The third thread came away. Catherine gasped.

"Still with me?" Elara asked.

"Still here."

Fourth thread. Fifth. Sixth.

Three hours in, Elara hit a complication. One thread was fused directly to Catherine's C3 vertebra. Removing it required scraping silver from bone. Required precision measured in microns.

"This is going to hurt," Elara warned.

"Everything hurts. Do it."

Elara worked. Catherine made sounds—low, controlled, the voice of someone who'd learned that screaming didn't help. Her hands gripped the edge of the worktable hard enough that the wood cracked.

The thread came free.

"Still breathing?" Elara asked.

"Still breathing."

Five hours in, Elara removed the final spinal thread. The gorget came apart in three pieces. Catherine's neck was revealed—pale, scarred, threaded with silver, but free.

Catherine stood slowly. Turned her head left, then right. Full range of motion.

Then she started crying.

Not gentle tears like when she saw her face. Full sobbing. Catherine collapsed against the worktable, shoulders shaking, crying like someone who'd forgotten how and was relearning through force.

Elara held her. Let her break. Let her cry seven years of pain into Elara's shoulder.

"I can move," Catherine said between sobs. "I can move my head. I can look up. I can look down. I haven't been able to—seven years of looking straight ahead and now I can—"

She demonstrated. Looked up at the ceiling. Down at the floor. Side to side. Each movement accompanied by fresh tears.

"I'm sorry," Catherine said. "I don't know why I'm—"

"You're processing. It's normal."

"This is normal?"

"For someone learning to be human again? Yes."

Catherine pulled back. Wiped her eyes. "I'm a mess."

"You're beautiful."

"I'm crying and broken and—"

"Beautiful," Elara said firmly. "Broken things can be beautiful. You are beautiful."

Catherine kissed her.

Different from the kisses before. This one tasted like salt and silver and something fierce. This one said: *I'm alive, I'm free, I'm choosing you.*

They pulled apart.

"Bed?" Catherine asked.

"Yes."

They went upstairs. Lay together. Closer than before. Catherine's head tucked under Elara's chin, Elara's arms wrapped around Catherine's waist, careful of bandages.

"What happens next?" Catherine asked.

"Next we remove the waist armor. Then legs. Then feet. Another two weeks if we're lucky."

"And after?"

"After you're free. Completely. And we figure out what that means."

"And if the kingdoms come for me before then?"

"We deal with it."

"How?"

"I don't know yet. But we'll find a way."

Catherine's breathing slowed. Evened out. Sleep.

Elara stayed awake. Counted Catherine's heartbeats against her chest. Seventy-two per minute. Human normal. Healing.

Counted the ways this could end badly. War. Execution. Separation. Loss.

Counted the ways it could end well. Freedom. Safety. Together. Love.

The good outcomes seemed less likely. But Elara had learned to work with unlikely odds. Had learned to cut silver from bone. Had learned to save someone she was falling for.

Could learn to fight for a future that seemed impossible.

Outside, night became dawn.

Inside, Catherine slept. Elara kept watch.

The armor pieces on the workbench caught the light. Gauntlets. Vambraces. Pauldrons. Helmet. Gorget. Evidence of three weeks of work.

Halfway done.

The dangerous half still ahead.
