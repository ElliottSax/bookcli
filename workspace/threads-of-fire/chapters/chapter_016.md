# Chapter 16

Catherine woke on day forty-eight.

Three days unconscious. Three days of Elara keeping vigil, counting heartbeats, begging her to wake up. Three days of Council delays—they'd granted an extension when they learned Catherine was comatose, unwilling to evict a dying woman.

Temporary mercy.

Catherine's eyes opened at dawn. Focused on the ceiling. Fourteen beams. She'd learned to count them from Elara.

"You're awake," Elara said. Voice hoarse from three days of talking to an unconscious person.

"How long?"

"Three days."

Catherine tried to sit up. Failed. Her body wouldn't cooperate—weak, damaged, barely functional.

"Don't move," Elara said. "You nearly died. Your heart stopped twice. You need rest."

"The threads?"

"All removed. Sixty total. You're free."

Catherine's hand went to her feet. Found bandages instead of armor. Found human skin instead of silver.

"I'm free," she repeated. Like testing the words. "Completely?"

"Completely."

Catherine started crying. Not gentle tears. Full sobbing. Three days of unconsciousness releasing in emotion.

Elara held her. Let her break. Let her be human in all the messy ways humans were allowed to be.

"I thought I'd die," Catherine said between sobs. "I thought the extraction would kill me before I got to be free."

"You're stronger than you think."

"No. You're stubbornner than I deserve. You kept me alive."

"We kept each other alive."

They held each other until Catherine's crying slowed. Until breathing evened. Until the world felt slightly less overwhelming.

"What happened while I was unconscious?" Catherine asked.

"The Council granted an extension. We have until you're mobile. They won't evict a comatose woman."

"Generous of them."

"Political expediency. If you died here, both kingdoms would blame Ferrum. Better to wait until you can walk, then kick us out."

"How long do we have?"

"Days. Maybe a week."

"And then?"

"Then we leave Ironhearth. Find somewhere the kingdoms won't look."

Catherine was quiet. "I'm sorry. You're losing your home because of me."

"You're worth it."

"Am I? Or am I worth it because you feel guilty about your mother?"

Elara pulled back. "Who told you that?"

"Your father. I heard him when I was half-conscious. He said you're trying to save me to make up for failing her."

"He's wrong."

"Is he?"

Elara counted to ten. Breathed. Met Catherine's eyes.

"My mother's death made me afraid of failing people. That's true. But this—you—that's not about guilt. That's about love." Elara's voice was steady. "I love you because you're brave and stubborn and learning to be human. Not because I failed someone else and need redemption."

"How do you know?"

"Because guilt feels like burning. Love feels like counting your heartbeats and wanting them to keep going. Love feels like working twenty hours straight because losing you would be worse than losing my forge. Love feels like this." Elara kissed her. Soft. Certain. "That's not guilt."

Catherine kissed back. "I love you too."

They stayed close. Two women who'd fought through armor and politics and death to be together.

"What happens next?" Catherine asked.

"Next you heal. Then we run."

"Run where?"

"Anywhere that's not here. Ferrum won't protect us. Eldergard wants you dead. Argentum wants you dead. We go somewhere remote. Build a new life."

"Just us?"

"Just us."

Catherine was quiet. "I like that plan."

"Good. Because I don't have a backup."

They smiled at each other.

Then Catherine's expression shifted. "Elara?"

"Yes?"

"My feet hurt. Is that normal?"

Elara checked. Catherine's feet were swollen, inflamed, the wounds from extraction infected despite Elara's best efforts.

"I'll clean them again. Apply fresh bandages."

She worked methodically. Counted wounds: Sixty entry points where threads had been. Seventeen showing signs of infection. Three critical.

"This will hurt," Elara warned before applying antiseptic.

It hurt.

Catherine made controlled sounds. Her hands gripped the bedframe. Wood cracked under her grasp.

When Elara finished, Catherine was shaking.

"How bad?" Catherine asked.

"Manageable. The infections are superficial. They'll heal."

"Truth?"

"Truth."

Catherine nodded. Trusted.

They spent the day not working. Catherine was too weak to stand. Elara was too exhausted to think. They lay in bed together, tangled close, both healing in different ways.

"Tell me about your mother," Catherine said.

Elara tensed. "Why?"

"Because you've been carrying her death for eight years. I want to help carry it."

Elara was quiet for a long time. Then:

"Her name was Margaret. She was taller than me. Better at metalwork. She could hear what metal wanted in a way I've never managed. She taught me everything—how to count temperature, how to read alloys, how to be precise when precision was survival."

"How did she die?"

"I was sixteen. Learning high-temperature work—chromium, tungsten, metals that need fifteen hundred degrees. I set up the forge wrong. Temperature spiked. There was an explosion. She pushed me out of the way. Took the blast herself."

"You were sixteen."

"Old enough to know better."

"You were a child learning a dangerous trade."

"I was her apprentice. Her daughter. I should have—" Elara stopped. "I should have checked. Should have counted. Should have been better."

"And if she'd let you take the blast? If you'd died instead?"

"She'd be alive."

"And she'd carry the same guilt you carry now. The same blame. The same eight years of thinking she should have been better." Catherine's hand found Elara's. "Your mother made a choice. Pushed you aside. Saved you. That's not your fault. That's love."

Elara's eyes were wet. "My father doesn't see it that way."

"Your father is wrong. Your mother loved you enough to die for you. That's not your failure. That's her gift."

They were quiet.

Elara counted ceiling beams. Fourteen. Counted Catherine's heartbeats against her chest. Fifty-four per minute. Still too slow but improving.

"Thank you," Elara said.

"For what?"

"For helping me carry it."

"That's what love is. Carrying each other's impossible weights."

They slept tangled together. Both damaged. Both healing. Both choosing each other despite everything.

Outside, war continued. Kingdoms hunted. Politics churned.

Inside, they rested.

Tomorrow they'd face eviction. Face running. Face whatever came next.

Tonight they had this: Each other. Free. Alive. Together.

That had to be enough.
