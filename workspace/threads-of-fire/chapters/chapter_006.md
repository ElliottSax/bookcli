# Chapter 6

The chest piece came off at midnight on the fourteenth day.

Elara had spent six hours working the release mechanism—probe and patience and hands that shook less now, hands that had learned the difference between silver-that-wanted-to-stay and silver-that-wanted-to-leave. The threads fought harder here. Closer to Catherine's heart. Closer to whatever core of humanity the armor had been slowly consuming.

Catherine hadn't made a sound in three hours.

She'd learned not to. Had learned that screaming didn't help, that crying didn't help, that the only thing that helped was breathing through the pain and counting (Elara had taught her that—counting as prayer, as rhythm, as survival). Catherine counted her breaths now. In for four. Hold for four. Out for four.

Elara counted her heartbeats. Still too slow. 61 per minute. But alive. Still alive.

"Almost," Elara said. Her voice was rough from disuse. "Last lock."

"You said that an hour ago."

"This time I mean it."

"You said that an hour ago too."

Elara smiled despite herself. Catherine was getting better at this—at humor, at lightness, at the small rebellions that meant someone's humanity was growing back. Two weeks ago Catherine wouldn't have joked. Wouldn't have known how.

The last lock released.

The chest piece fell away.

Underneath—

Elara's hands stopped moving.

Underneath, Catherine was a map of silver.

The threads had woven across her ribs like lace. Beautiful. Terrible. Forty-seven major threads (Elara counted automatically, couldn't help it). They wrapped her ribcage, dove between bones, disappeared into the cavity where her heart and lungs fought for space against metallic invasion.

And her skin.

Catherine's skin was pale as winter moonlight. Elara could see *everything*—every rib, every breath, the small hollow at the base of her throat where pulse beat visible. Could count her heartbeats just by watching. 61. 62. 61 again.

Could see the way Catherine's whole torso was shaking.

Not pain-shaking. Not fear-shaking.

Cold-shaking.

Catherine's core temperature had to be—what? 30°C? 29? That was hypothermic. That was dangerous. That was the point where your body started shutting down non-essential systems like "caring about staying alive."

"You're freezing," Elara said.

"I'm always freezing."

"This is worse. Your core—"

"Is fine."

"Is failing."

Catherine looked down at herself. At the silver lace across her ribs. At the way the threads pulsed faintly with each heartbeat, drinking warmth, replacing it with cold. "I can't feel it anymore. The cold. Used to hurt. Now it's just—" She gestured vaguely. "Normal."

"That's not normal."

"It's my normal."

Elara stood. Crossed to the forge. Fed more wood to the fire. The temperature climbed—900 degrees, 1000, 1100. Hot enough to make the whole room shimmer. Hot enough that sweat beaded on Elara's forehead, slid down her spine.

"Come here," Elara said.

Catherine stood. Swayed. Caught herself on the workbench. Her exposed torso was still shaking—small tremors that meant her body was trying to generate heat and failing.

Elara guided her to stand in front of the forge. Close. Close enough that the heat should feel good, should feel like relief.

Catherine flinched.

"Too hot?" Elara asked.

"I don't know." Catherine's voice was strange. Distant. "I can't—it's too much. All the sensation is too much."

She wrapped her arms around herself. Covered the silver-laced ribs with her hands—those pale hands with three freckles and nails that had stayed silver even after the gauntlet came off. Tried to make herself small. Tried to hide the evidence of what the binding had done.

Elara's throat was tight.

She'd seen damaged metalwork before. Seen blades that had been forged wrong, quenched wrong, tempered wrong. Seen the way metal could be ruined by good intentions and bad technique. But metal could be reforged. Could be made new.

Catherine couldn't.

Whatever the binding had done to her—it was permanent. Even if they removed every thread, every piece of armor, the scars would remain. The silver nails. The too-cold skin. The heart that had forgotten how to race.

"Look at me," Elara said.

Catherine's eyes were closed.

"Catherine. Look at me."

Catherine opened her eyes. Those summer-moss eyes that Elara had cataloged the first day—Pantone 18-0135 TPX, specific and beautiful and currently swimming with tears Catherine was too stubborn to shed.

"You're staring at my ribs," Catherine said. "At the threads. At how wrong I am."

"I'm staring because you're beautiful."

Silence.

The forge crackled. Outside, the church bell tolled twelve times. Midnight. The hour when truth came easier because darkness hid faces and made honesty less terrifying.

"I'm not beautiful," Catherine said. "I'm ruined."

"You're both."

"That's not—"

"You are." Elara stepped closer. One step. Then another. Until she was close enough to feel the cold radiating from Catherine's skin, close enough to see the exact pattern of the silver threads (they wove in Fibonacci spirals, of course they did, magic always chose mathematical elegance). "You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. And the most heartbreaking. And I've spent two weeks trying not to think about how much I want to—"

She stopped.

Catherine's breath had gone still. "Want to what?"

Elara couldn't answer. Couldn't say: *touch you*. Couldn't say: *know what you feel like when you're not shaking apart*. Couldn't say: *find out if you taste like summer moss or if that's just my imagination making metaphors out of wanting*.

Couldn't say any of it.

But her hands—her traitor hands that knew metal better than they knew restraint—reached out anyway.

She touched Catherine's ribs.

Skin-to-skin. No armor between them. Just Elara's scarred fingers against Catherine's too-cold torso, tracing the path of a silver thread that wrapped her eighth rib (Elara counted, always counting).

Catherine made a sound.

Not pain. Not fear. Something else. Something that sounded like the moment when metal became molten—that crack between solid and liquid, between control and surrender.

"You're so cold," Elara whispered.

"I know."

"And I'm—"

"So warm."

Catherine's hands came up. Hesitated. Then settled on Elara's waist—tentative touch, like someone who'd forgotten how hands worked, how contact worked, how wanting another person was supposed to feel.

Elara's heart was racing. 110 beats per minute. 120. She counted because counting was the only thing keeping her from closing the last 15cm between them and—

"We shouldn't," Catherine said.

"I know."

"You're trying to save my life. This is—it's transference. Gratitude. I'm conflating survival with—"

"Shut up."

Catherine blinked. "What?"

"I said shut up." Elara's hands were still on Catherine's ribs. Could feel every breath. Could count every heartbeat (62, speeding up, 64, 66). "You're doing that thing soldiers do. Where you try to logic your way out of feeling anything. Where you rationalize and compartmentalize and pretend emotions are just chemical reactions you can control."

"Emotions *are* chemical reactions."

"So is fire. Still burns."

Catherine was quiet. Her thumbs moved against Elara's waist—small circles, unconscious gesture, like her hands didn't know what else to do.

"I haven't wanted anyone in seven years," Catherine said. Her voice was barely above a whisper. "Haven't let myself. Thought wanting was weakness. Thought perfect knights didn't—"

"You're not a perfect knight."

"I know."

"You're human."

"Barely."

"Catherine." Elara's hands slid up—ribs to collarbone, collarbone to throat, throat to jaw. Cupped Catherine's face between palms that were calloused and scarred and shaking. "You're the most human person I know. You're just scared of it."

Catherine leaned into the touch. Closed her eyes. Shivered—not cold this time, something else. "What if I don't remember how? How to want someone. How to—"

"Then I'll teach you."

The words hung between them.

Elara felt them land. Felt the weight of the promise. Felt Catherine's breath catch and her pulse jump (68, 70, 72—her heart was learning to race again).

"How?" Catherine whispered.

"Like this."

Elara leaned in.

15cm became 10cm became 5cm became—

The forge behind them popped. Loud. Sharp. A knot in the wood exploding from heat.

They both jumped.

Elara pulled back. Laughed—shaky, breathless laugh. "Sorry. The forge—"

"I know."

"Bad timing."

"Yes."

They stood there. Hands still touching. Both breathing too fast. The space between them was maybe 8cm now. Close enough to feel each other's breath. Close enough that if either of them moved—

Catherine stepped back.

"I can't," she said.

Elara's hands fell away. "Can't or won't?"

"I don't know the difference anymore."

"What are you afraid of?"

"Dying before I get to—" Catherine stopped. Closed her eyes. "Wanting you and dying anyway. Wanting you and living and having to leave. Wanting you and—"

"Wanting me."

"Yes."

Elara crossed her arms over her chest. Counted to ten. The rejection hurt—not surprising, hurt was familiar, Elara had extensive experience with loss. But this hurt was different. This was the hurt of *almost*. The hurt of knowing Catherine wanted her back and was choosing to run anyway.

"You should go," Elara said. Her voice came out colder than intended. Blacksmith-cold. Business-cold. The voice she used with customers who questioned her prices.

Catherine flinched like she'd been struck. "Elara—"

"It's late. You need rest. I need to clean up. Tomorrow we'll work on the shoulder pieces."

"Please don't—"

"Don't what? Don't acknowledge that you just said you want me and then immediately ran? Don't have feelings about it? Don't be human?" Elara turned away. Started cleaning her workbench with jerky, too-hard movements. "I thought you said I was allowed to feel things."

"You are."

"Then let me be angry."

Silence.

Then, quietly: "I'm sorry."

"I don't want your apology. I want—" Elara stopped. Pressed her hands flat on the workbench. Counted the tools laid out (23). Counted her own heartbeats (still too fast, 98, 96, refusing to slow). "I want you to stop pretending you're already dead. You're not dead. You're standing right here. And you want me. And I want you. And you're choosing duty over—"

"Over what? Over a few weeks of happiness before I die anyway?"

"You're not going to die."

"You can't know that."

"I'm going to save you."

"What if you can't?" Catherine's voice broke. "What if you do everything right and I die anyway? What if the threads are too deep? What if my heart gives out or the magic poisons me or I just—what if I don't survive this?"

Elara turned around.

Catherine was crying.

Actually crying. Tears running down her face, her too-cold skin, her cheeks that probably hadn't felt tears in years. Crying the way people cried when they'd held it in too long and couldn't hold it anymore.

Elara crossed the space between them. Didn't think. Didn't count. Just moved.

She pulled Catherine against her. Wrapped arms around that shaking, too-cold body. Held her while she cried—ugly crying, the kind that came with gasping breaths and shaking shoulders and sounds that hurt to hear.

"I'm sorry," Catherine kept saying into Elara's shoulder. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

"For what?"

"For wanting you. For being broken. For not being brave enough to—"

"You're the bravest person I know."

"I'm terrified."

"Brave people are always terrified. That's what makes it brave."

Catherine's arms came around Elara's waist. Held on like Elara was an anchor in a storm. Like if she let go she'd drown.

They stood there. Elara counted Catherine's heartbeats against her chest (74, 76, 78—still learning, still trying). Counted her own breaths (in for four, hold for four, out for four—she'd stolen Catherine's rhythm). Counted the seconds they stayed like this (180, 181, 182).

At 200 seconds, Catherine pulled back.

Her eyes were red. Her face was blotchy. She looked more human than Elara had ever seen her.

"I should go," Catherine said.

"You said that already."

"This time I mean it."

Catherine gathered her armor pieces. Put the gauntlet back on (winced doing it, the mechanism fought her). Wrapped her exposed torso in the cloak she'd brought. Didn't look at Elara while doing it.

At the door, she stopped.

"Tomorrow," she said. "Dawn."

"I'll be here."

"Elara—"

"Go, Catherine. Before I do something we'll both regret."

Catherine's hand tightened on the doorframe. "Would you regret it?"

Silence.

Then, honest: "No."

Catherine left.

Elara stood in her forge and listened to armored footsteps fade. Listened until she couldn't hear them. Then she turned back to the fire.

The forge was still burning. Still hot. 1100 degrees and climbing.

Elara picked up her hammer. Started striking metal that didn't need striking, just to have something to do with her hands.

Strike. Strike. Strike.

She'd almost kissed Catherine.

Strike. Strike. Strike.

Catherine had almost let her.

Strike. Strike. Strike.

They'd both run.

Strike.

Elara's arms ached. Her shoulders burned. She kept hammering.

At some point the metal cooled. She reheated it. Hammered more.

At some point the sun rose.

She was still at the forge when the church bell tolled six times.

Dawn.

Catherine would be here soon.

Elara set down her hammer. Looked at what she'd forged.

A ring.

Small. Silver. Delicate enough for a woman's hand.

She'd made it without thinking. Muscle memory. Heart memory. The memory of Catherine's too-cold fingers trembling in hers.

Elara dropped the ring into the slack tub. Watched it sink.

The door opened.

Catherine stood there. Still wearing armor. Still looking exhausted. But her eyes—those summer-moss eyes—went straight to Elara.

"You didn't sleep," Catherine said.

"Neither did you."

"I was thinking."

"So was I."

They stood in the doorway. The space between them was 3 meters now. Safer distance. Professional distance.

"About last night—" Catherine started.

"We don't have to talk about it."

"I want to."

"Do you?"

Catherine stepped inside. Closed the door behind her. Crossed the 3 meters to stand in front of Elara—close enough that Elara could smell her (still cold, still steel, but also: soap, like Catherine had bathed this morning, like she'd tried to wash off the armor's smell).

"I was wrong," Catherine said.

Elara waited.

"Last night. When I said I couldn't. I was wrong." Catherine's hands were shaking. "I can't promise I'll survive this. Can't promise I won't have to leave. Can't promise anything except—"

"Except what?"

"Except that I want you. And I'm tired of pretending I don't. And if I'm going to die in six weeks, I want to spend them wanting you instead of running from it."

Elara's heart stopped. Started again. Raced.

"That's not a no," she said.

"That's not a no."

They looked at each other.

And Elara smiled.
