# Chapter 8

The soldiers came on day sixteen.

Not Eldergard soldiers. Ferrum's city guard. Three of them, armor polished, expressions neutral. Professional courtesy masking political pressure.

Elara was alone in the forge when they arrived. Catherine was upstairs sleeping—her third proper sleep in as many days, each one longer than the last. Learning to rest.

"Elara Thorne?" the lead guard asked.

"That's me."

"The Council requests your presence. Questions regarding your current... project."

Not a request. A summons.

"When?"

"Now would be convenient."

Elara wiped her hands on her apron. Glanced at the stairs leading to her room where Catherine slept. The guards followed her gaze.

"Alone would be preferable," the lead guard said. Voice still polite. Still steel underneath.

Elara went.

The Council met in the old courthouse—stone building, high ceilings, windows that let in cold light. Five councilors sat in a semicircle. Elara recognized three: Merchant Voss, Minister Chen, Captain Rourke. The other two were unfamiliar.

"Mistress Thorne," Merchant Voss said. "Thank you for coming."

"Didn't seem like I had a choice."

"Everyone has choices. We're here to discuss yours." Voss leaned forward. "You've been working with Dame Catherine Valois for sixteen days. What is the nature of your work?"

"Armor repair."

"Repair?" Minister Chen's eyebrow raised. "Our sources indicate you've been removing armor. Not repairing it."

"Removal is a form of repair. The armor was integrated incorrectly. I'm correcting the integration."

"Dame Valois is Eldergard military. A diplomat. Her presence in Ironhearth is meant to facilitate peace negotiations." Captain Rourke's voice was flat. "Those negotiations have collapsed. Argentum has withdrawn. Eldergard has recalled their delegation. The only Eldergard representative still in Ironhearth is Dame Valois. Why is she still here?"

"Medical treatment."

"From a blacksmith?"

"From a specialist in magic-alloy integration," Elara said. Same lie she'd told Commander Ashford. Delivered with the same confidence.

"And this treatment requires how much longer?"

"Four weeks. Minimum."

"Unacceptable," Merchant Voss said. "The peace talks have failed. War is likely. Eldergard views Ferrum with increasing hostility. We cannot afford to harbor an Eldergard knight who refuses to leave."

"She's not refusing. She's recovering."

"She's a political liability." Minister Chen stood. Paced. "Argentum is already spreading rumors that Ferrum is holding Dame Valois against her will. Using her as use. Eldergard has requested proof of life. We're caught between two hostile kingdoms because one knight won't leave a civilian forge."

Elara's hands clenched. "She'll die if she leaves."

"That's her problem."

"It's a human problem. She's dying. I can save her. You want me to stop because it's politically inconvenient?"

"We want you to understand the stakes," Captain Rourke said. "If war comes—when war comes—Ironhearth is the border city. We'll be the first target. Thousands of lives depend on political stability. Dame Valois's health is tragic. But it's not worth a war."

"So sacrifice her to maybe prevent a war that's coming anyway?"

"Yes." Merchant Voss didn't hesitate. "If necessary."

Elara counted to ten. Breathed. Tried to remember that these were rational people making rational calculations. That from their perspective, one life versus thousands was an easy choice.

From Elara's perspective, Catherine's life wasn't negotiable.

"I'll talk to her," Elara said. "Explain the situation. But I won't force her to leave. That's her choice."

"Then help her make the right choice," Minister Chen said. "For everyone's sake."

They dismissed her.

Elara walked back to the forge slowly. Counted bricks in buildings (forty-seven in the courthouse facade, same as her bedroom). Counted steps (two hundred nineteen from courthouse to forge). Counted heartbeats (raise, ninety-four per minute, fear and anger mixing).

Catherine was awake when she returned. Sitting at the workbench, examining her own armor pieces. The collection had grown: gauntlets, vambraces, rerebraces, pauldrons, chest plate sections. Evidence of sixteen days of work.

"Where were you?" Catherine asked.

"Council meeting."

Catherine's expression shifted. "What did they want?"

"To understand why Eldergard's remaining diplomat is holed up in a civilian forge instead of doing diplomacy."

"What did you tell them?"

"That you're receiving medical treatment. That you'll leave when you're healed."

"And they accepted that?"

"No." Elara sat across from Catherine. "They want you gone. War is coming. You're a political liability. They asked me to convince you to leave."

"And will you?"

"No. But you should know the stakes. Ironhearth is the border city. If Argentum attacks, this is where they'll hit first. Thousands of people live here. The Council thinks your presence makes war more likely."

Catherine's hands stilled on the armor. "They're probably right."

"That's not the answer I expected."

"It's the truth. Eldergard is angry I deserted. Argentum thinks Ferrum is hiding me. Ferrum is caught between them. My presence destabilizes everything." Catherine looked up. "I should leave."

"No."

"Elara, I can't—"

"You'll die if you leave. The armor removal isn't complete. Your heart is still half-threaded. If you stop now, the remaining threads will kill you within two weeks."

"Two weeks versus thousands of lives in a war?"

"You don't know there'll be a war. The Council is afraid. Fear makes bad decisions." Elara leaned forward. "Stay. Finish the removal. We'll deal with the politics after."

"And if war comes because I stayed?"

"Then war was coming anyway. Peace negotiations don't collapse because one person gets medical treatment. They collapse because kingdoms want war and are looking for excuses."

Catherine was quiet. Her fingers traced the edge of her chest plate—the piece they'd removed six days ago. The piece that had nearly killed her.

"I don't want to be the reason people die," she said quietly. "I volunteered for the binding to prevent deaths. If staying here causes a war, then I'm failing all over again. I'm letting people die because I want to live."

"You're letting people make their own choices. Argentum chooses war or peace. Eldergard chooses to hunt deserters or let them go. Ferrum chooses to protect refugees or throw them to wolves. None of that is your responsibility."

"Isn't it? I'm the knight. The diplomat. The—"

"You're a person. You're allowed to choose yourself sometimes."

Catherine smiled. Sad. Tired. "I've spent seven years choosing duty over self. I don't know how to do it differently."

"So learn. You're already learning to sleep. Learning to eat. Learning to rest. Add 'choosing yourself' to the list."

"Is that an order?"

"Yes. From your blacksmith."

Catherine laughed. Short. Real. "You're authoritative for someone who's technically my employee."

"In this forge, we're equals. And equals get to tell each other when they're being self-destructive."

They sat in silence for a moment. Then Catherine nodded.

"Okay," she said. "I'll stay. We'll finish the removal. And if the Council has a problem with that, they can take it up with me."

"Deal."

---

They removed the helmet on day seventeen.

The helmet was complex. Not because of threading—the threads here were shallow, woven into scalp tissue but not bone. Complex because of what it represented.

"I haven't seen my own face in seven years," Catherine said. "The helmet doesn't have openings. No visor. Nothing. I've been blind to my own reflection."

"Are you ready to see it?"

"I don't know. What if I don't recognize myself?"

"Then we'll figure it out together."

The helmet came off in three pieces. Faceplate first. Catherine's face was revealed slowly—forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin. Each section showing skin that hadn't seen light in seven years.

Pale. So pale it was almost translucent. Silver veining visible at temples. Scars from where the helmet had fused—thin lines running from hairline to jaw.

But recognizable. Human.

Catherine's hand went to her face. Touched her cheek like she'd never felt it before.

"Mirror," she said. "I need a mirror."

Elara retrieved one from upstairs. Small. Handheld. The kind used for checking detail work.

Catherine took it. Stared at her reflection.

Thirty seconds. Sixty. Ninety.

Then she started crying.

Not sobbing. Not breaking down. water running down her face while her expression stayed neutral. Like her body was processing emotion her mind couldn't handle yet.

"I look older," she said. "I was nineteen when they put the helmet on. I'm twenty-six now. Seven years. I can see them in my face."

"You look human."

"I look haunted." Catherine's fingers traced the scars. "These won't fade, will they?"

"Probably not. Silver scarring is permanent."

"So I'll carry the binding forever. Even after the armor's gone."

"Yes. But scars aren't weakness. They're proof you survived."

Catherine set the mirror down. Wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. "I need a minute."

"Take your time."

Elara went back to the forge. Gave Catherine space. Counted tools. Organized supplies. Tried not to think about how Catherine's tears had looked silver in the light. Tried not to think about the Council's warning. Tried not to think about soldiers and war and the thousand ways this could end badly.

Catherine came back after twenty minutes. Eyes red. Face composed.

"Sorry," she said.

"Don't apologize for feeling things."

"I'm not used to feeling things. It's—" She stopped. "Overwhelming. Everything is overwhelming. Seeing my face. Breathing without armor. Sleeping. Eating. Wanting. I don't know how to process it all."

"So don't. Not all at once. Process one thing at a time." Elara handed her a cup of water. "Today you process seeing your face. Tomorrow we'll tackle something else."

Catherine drank. "What if I can't handle it? What if being human is too much?"

"Then we'll find a way to make it less. Gradual exposure. Small steps. Whatever you need."

"You're patient with me."

"You're worth being patient for."

Catherine smiled. Small. Shy. The expression looked different on her bare face—more genuine, more fragile, more real.

"Thank you," she said. For the eighteenth time in seventeen days.

"You're welcome," Elara said. For the eighteenth time in return.

---

The spies showed up on day eighteen.

Elara noticed them first. Two figures in civilian clothing watching the forge from across the street. Different people than yesterday. Different kingdom's colors hidden under neutral cloaks.

Argentum spies yesterday. Eldergard today.

Both kingdoms tracking Catherine's location.

"We're being watched," Elara told Catherine.

"I know. I've been counting them."

"How many?"

"Four different agents over the last week. Two Argentum, two Eldergard. They rotate shifts. Professional surveillance."

"Does it bother you?"

"Less than it should." Catherine was braiding her hair—a simple braid, the kind that kept hair out of her face during armor removal. Her movements were clumsy. Seven years without practice. "I spent seven years being watched. Monitored. Evaluated. This is more of the same."

"Except now they're watching to see if you're a deserter or a hostage."

"Does it matter which?"

"To them? Yes. To us? No."

Catherine finished the braid. It was uneven. Crooked. Imperfect. She didn't seem to care.

"We should be careful," she said. "No public appearances together. No obvious affection. Give them nothing to report back except 'knight receiving medical treatment from blacksmith.'"

"Is that what we are? Knight and blacksmith?"

"Isn't it?"

The question hung in the air. Knight and blacksmith. Deserter and conspirator. Patient and healer. The labels felt simultaneously true and insufficient.

"I don't know what we are," Elara admitted. "Still figuring it out."

"Me too."

They worked in silence after that. Elara on commissions. Catherine learning to work leather—Elara had given her scraps to practice on, teaching her basic stitching. Catherine's fingers were clumsy but determined. Same stubborn focus she brought to everything.

The spy across the street watched. Took notes. Left at sundown.

A different spy arrived an hour later.

"It's going to get worse," Catherine said at dinner. They were eating upstairs—bread and cheese and dried meat. Simple food. Catherine was still relearning appetite. "As the armor removal progresses, they'll escalate. Eldergard will want me back. Argentum will want me gone. Ferrum will want me silent. All three kingdoms will pressure you."

"Let them pressure."

"Elara, you could lose everything. Your forge. Your reputation. Your freedom. They could charge you with treason for harboring me."

"Then they'll charge me. I'm not kicking you out to satisfy politics."

"Why not? I'm not worth this."

"You are to me."

Catherine stopped eating. "Why?"

The same question from before. Different context. Same weight.

Elara set down her bread. "Because the first time you walked into my forge, you looked at me like I could save you. And I'd spent eight years believing I couldn't save anyone. And then I did. I saved you. Or I'm saving you. And that matters. You matter."

"Is this still about your mother?"

"No. This is about you. About the way you count heartbeats when you're scared. About the way you laugh at terrible metalwork. About the way you touch your own face like you're meeting yourself for the first time. About the way you said 'not yet, soon' instead of running. You matter, Catherine. Not as a political symbol or a deserter or a knight. As a person. And I'm not giving up on you because three kingdoms can't handle one woman choosing to live."

Catherine was quiet for a long moment.

Then: "Ask me again."

"Ask you what?"

"What you asked before. In the forge. After the shoulder pieces came off."

Elara's heart rate spiked. "Catherine—"

"Ask me again. Please."

"You said not yet. You said soon. It's been six days. That's not long enough for—"

"It's long enough. Ask me."

Elara counted to five. Breathed. Met Catherine's eyes across the small table in the small room in the forge where Catherine was learning to be human again.

"Can I kiss you?"

"Yes," Catherine said.

They didn't move.

The space between them felt simultaneously vast and nonexistent.

Elara stood first. Crossed the distance. Catherine stood to meet her.

They were close enough to touch. Close enough to count heartbeats. Close enough to see the silver veining at Catherine's temples, the scars from the helmet, the summer-moss green of her eyes.

"Are you sure?" Elara asked.

"No. But I want this anyway. I want you anyway. Ask me again so I can say yes again."

"Can I kiss you?"

"Yes."

Elara kissed her.
