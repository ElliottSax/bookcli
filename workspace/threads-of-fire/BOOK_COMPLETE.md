## BOOK SUMMARY

### Logline
A blacksmith who reads metal's truth falls for a knight whose armor is fused to her skin. To save her life, they must remove the armor piece by piece—and choose between duty and a love that could destroy them both.

### Characters
- **Elara Thorne** (24): Master blacksmith, can "read" metal, trauma from mother's forge death
- **Dame Catherine Valois** (26): Knight-captain, armor magically fused for 7 years, slowly dying

### Plot
Catherine arrives in Ironhearth for peace negotiations. Elara hears her armor *screaming*—discovers it's poisoning Catherine, who has 6-8 weeks to live. Elara agrees to remove the armor despite knowing it will be excruciating. Daily removal sessions = forced proximity. Attraction becomes love. External pressure: Both kingdoms disapprove, Catherine ordered to return, deadline approaching. Climax: Catherine chooses Elara over duty, armor fully removed, both nearly die. Resolution: Catherine survives, granted asylum, peace achieved. HEA: Wedding, domestic bliss, forging life together.

### Themes
- **Prison of perfection**: Armor = protection = imprisonment (literal and metaphorical)
- **Truth of touch**: Elara reads metal, Catherine starving for human contact (touch as truth-telling)
- **Choosing softness**: Both trained to be hard (metal, armor, walls), love requires vulnerability

## THEMES RESOLUTION

### Prison of Perfection → Freedom Through Imperfection

**Established**: Catherine's armor as literal prison (perfect knight = trapped, inhuman)
**Developed**: Removing armor = regaining humanity (painful, necessary)
**Resolved**: Catherine free, scarred, imperfect, *alive* (Chapter 22: "Tomorrow I might wear it. Tonight I choose to be free.")

### Truth of Touch → Touch as Healing

**Established**: Elara reads metal truth, Catherine forbidden touch
**Developed**: Every touch between them is truth-telling (no lies possible)
**Resolved**: Touch as primary love language (Chapter 12: Catherine learning to feel, Chapter 22: Forging rings together)

### Choosing Softness → Strength in Vulnerability

**Established**: Both trained to be hard (metal, armor, walls), softness = weakness
**Developed**: Love requires being soft enough to hurt (Catherine's choice to want despite fear)
**Resolved**: Strength found in vulnerability (Both stronger together, softness as courage)

## TECHNICAL EXECUTION

### Obsessive Details (Recurring) ✅

**Hands as Identity**:
- Elara: Scarred, calloused, 18 burn marks counted daily
- Catherine: Pale, three freckles (Ursa Minor), silver nails
- Throughout: Hand-holding, hand-examining, hands as maps of trauma/healing

**Temperature as Obsession**:
- Catherine: 32°C (hypothermic) → 35°C (recovering) → 36.8°C (human)
- Elara: Always warm (forge-heat), source of warmth for Catherine
- Every touch cataloged by temperature differential

**Counting as Ritual**:
- Elara counts everything: Heartbeats, scars, seconds, tools, ceiling beams
- Catherine learns counting from Elara (breathing, pain management)
- Final chapter: "Some things are too big to measure. But I'll count them anyway."

**Heartbeats as Life-Force**:
- Catherine: 62 BPM (too slow) → 55 (failing) → 47 (nearly dead) → 74 (healthy)
- Every intimate moment includes heartbeat count
- Metaphor: Catherine's heart learning to race again = learning to live

### Sensory Palette ✅

**Recurring Images**:
- Fire: Destructive (mother's death) and creative (forge, love)
- Metal: Truth-teller, prison, protection, weapon, love (rings)
- Cold vs Heat: Catherine (cold, armor) vs Elara (warm, forge)
- Scars: Maps of trauma (both characters marked by past)

### Voice Consistency ✅

**Elara's Voice**:
- Technical precision (measurements, temperatures, exact counts)
- Tactile observations (everything described through touch/metal)
- Fragments during emotion ("Not thinking about that." "Not today.")
- Counting as grounding ("Quarter-turn clockwise. Two strikes.")

**Catherine's Voice**:
- Soldier-speak (formal, controlled, duty-focused)
- Gradual softening (humor, vulnerability emerging)
- Confessions in darkness (honest when can't see Elara's face)
- Personal language developing (from "the mission" to "you")
