CRITICAL FICTION QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:

1. SPECIFICITY OVER GENERALITY
   ✗ NEVER: "felt sad", "was angry", "seemed worried"
   ✓ ALWAYS: Physical sensation + specific memory + character action

2. SHOW OVER TELL
   ✗ NEVER: "learned that", "realized that", "understood that"
   ✓ ALWAYS: Character makes choice, reader infers meaning

3. VOICE DISTINCTIVENESS
   ✓ Include 3-5 sentence fragments per chapter
   ✓ "Not X. Y." pattern 2-3 times
   ✓ Vary sentence rhythm (3-word fragments to 40-word flows)

4. OBSESSIVE DEPTH
   ✓ Go deep on 1-2 recurring elements (hands, sensation, symbols)
   ✓ Spend 3x normal words on obsessive details

5. TRUST THE READER
   ✓ Leave 20% of questions unanswered
   ✓ Add contradictions (character says X, shows Y)
   ✓ Symbolic resonance without explanation

Example 2: Emotional Specificity Grief
Score: 8.5/10

Marcus's throat closed—that airless crush from the funeral, from every time someone said "your dad." Not the words. The way they said it, voice dropping like they'd discovered something fragile they might break.

He swallowed hard. Kept his hands busy with the binding mark, tracing the silver scar tissue. His right hand belonged to the Weavers now. His left hand—pencil callus, knife scar from age seven—still belonged to the man who'd taught him to whittle.

Three months. Dad had been gone three months and Marcus had learned to channel magic, survived a Binding ritual, killed corruption in human hosts. Dad would've been—

No. Not going there.

Marcus clenched both hands and kept walking.


Why this works: - Specific sensation: "airless crush from the funeral" (not "felt sad")
- Memory anchor: "every time someone said 'your dad'" with specific detail (voice dropping)
- Physical grounding: throat, hands,...
