# Chapter 8 Summary

**Word Count**: 2,075

## Key Events
- Mission briefing: All six keys receive assignments to different corruption nodes
- Sarai: Northern node (temporal distortions)
- Paulo: Western node (petrification spread)
- Jin: Southern node (phase-corruption)
- Dmitri: Eastern node (lightning storm fusion)
- Lily: Central underwater node (drowning resurrection cycle)
- Marcus: The Veil tangle itself (primary corruption)
- Marcus teaches other five keys basic pattern reading/healing in one afternoon
- All six keys deploy through portals at sunset
- Marcus arrives at bridge between realities
- Discovers the source: two people fused together for 1000 years

## Major Reveals
- Return crystals provide emergency extraction (30-second portal windows)
- Between-space is a real physical location (bridge of solidified starlight)
- The Veil is visibly failing with spreading cracks, black corruption leaking through
- Kira warns: success means permanent enslavement to Weaver service
- The tangle source confirmed: two people forcibly fused at hands/chest/head
- All other missions are fusion-related tangles (deliberate pattern)
- Millions die in first hour if Veil fails, billions within days

## Character Development
- Marcus: Takes on teacher role, shares Evan's techniques with others despite limited time
- Kira: Reveals the dark truth about "success" - eternal servitude to Weavers
- Lily: Determined to try healing first, will kill only if healing fails
- Dmitri: Sees his brother's fate in the mission assignments (fusion-death)
- Other keys: Accept they're expendable, choose to proceed anyway

## Threads Advanced
- Deployment timeline completed - all keys sent on missions
- Marcus reaches destination
- Source tangle identity confirmed (two fused people, 1000 years)
- Alternative healing techniques shared with other keys (limited training)
- Stakes explicitly stated (millions die immediately upon Veil collapse)

## Threads Opened
- Can Marcus separate two people after 1000 years of fusion?
- Are they still conscious inside the corruption?
- Will the other five keys survive their missions?
- What happens to Marcus after success (enslavement vs freedom)?
- How much time before complete Veil collapse?

## Next: Chapter 9 will show Marcus's first contact with the fused tangle
