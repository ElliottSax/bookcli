# Chapter 14 Summary

**Word Count**: 2,116

## Key Events
- Three weeks after Lily's recovery: Evan clears Marcus for channeling
- Marcus's channels healed but permanently scarred (ache when channeling)
- Begins formal 6-week dual-path training (Mending + combat)
- Week 1-2: Pattern sensitivity training (thread discrimination by sensation)
- Week 3-4: Combat integration (assess-decide-act in 3 seconds or less)
- Week 5: Surgical precision and minimum intervention points
- Week 6: Other keys request training, Marcus assists Evan
- All five keys (Dmitri, Jin, Paulo, Sarai, Lily) achieve basic competency
- Evan approves them for supervised field work

## Major Training Elements

**Six Fundamentals:**
1. Pattern sensitivity - feeling threads without visual confirmation
2. Thread discrimination - distinguishing types by sensation
3. Corruption assessment - active vs dormant, malignant vs benign
4. Energy regulation - sustained channeling without damage
5. Surgical precision - minimum intervention cuts
6. Emergency protocols - when to heal, when to cut, when to run

**Thread Sensations:**
- Life threads: warm
- Memory threads: cool, flowing
- Emotional connections: pulsing
- Physical bonds: solid, static

**Minimum Intervention Philosophy:**
- Remove only corrupting elements
- Preserve healthy connections
- Both patients survive when possible
- Relationship survives minus corruption

## Character Development
- Marcus: Transforms from rushed pioneer to methodical teacher
- Accepts need for proper foundation
- Learns patience and precision
- Becomes effective instructor
- Each key's unique strengths:
  - Lily: Corruption detection (near-death gave visceral understanding)
  - Paulo: Structural assessment (identifies weak points)
  - Sarai: Containment (temporary barriers for intervention time)
  - Jin: Pattern-space perspective (phase abilities give unique angles)
  - Dmitri: Combat discipline (timed drills, fast decision-making)

## Thematic Elements
- Pioneer pays the cost, followers benefit from hard-won knowledge
- Foundation prevents disasters (proper training vs Lily's near-death)
- Specificity matters ("try to heal" vs detailed protocol)
- Teaching requires mastery, not just competency
- Slow and careful beats fast and reckless

## Progress Metrics
- Marcus assessment time: 5 seconds → under 1 second (by week 4)
- Group training time: 2 weeks to basic competency
- Ready for: Supervised field work on small tangles

## Next Steps
- First supervised mission imminent
- Small tangles in controlled environments
- Marcus or Evan observing
- Test proper foundation in real conditions
