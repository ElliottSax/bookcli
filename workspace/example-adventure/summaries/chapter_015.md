# Chapter 15 Summary

**Word Count**: 1,897

## Key Events
- First supervised mission: Lily and Dmitri handle grief corruption
- Woman (late 50s, healer) lost 7-year-old daughter to fever
- Attempted grief binding for 3 years, corruption reached 50-60%
- Lily and Dmitri follow proper protocol:
  - Assess corruption level (correct initial estimate)
  - Get host cooperation through conversation
  - Contain corruption, then surgical cut
  - Successful outcome - host survives
- Over 2 weeks, all pairs complete multiple supervised missions:
  - Jin/Paulo: structural tangle (home foundation)
  - Sarai/Marcus: emotional binding (friendship oath)
  - Dmitri/Lily: hostile grief corruption (abort after minor infection)
  - Paulo/Jin: early fusion attempt (prevent Lyara-style catastrophe)
- Week 8: All keys complete training successfully
- Evan announces solo assignments starting tomorrow

## Mission Types Demonstrated
1. **Grief corruption** (woman/daughter) - successful healing
2. **Structural tangle** (home foundation) - successful surgery
3. **Emotional binding** (friendship oath) - preserved bond, removed corruption
4. **Hostile tangle** (fighting host) - proper abort protocol
5. **Early fusion** (lovers) - rapid response prevented catastrophe

## Key Protocols Applied
- Containment before intervention
- Host cooperation required (never force healing on fighting subject)
- Abort when host actively resists
- Call backup when needed
- Fighting host + corruption simultaneously = infection risk
- Knowing when to abort = as important as knowing when to intervene

## Character Development
- Lily: Doesn't freeze, makes right calls, applies lessons learned
- Dmitri: Recognizes infection spreading, pulls back (unlike his brother)
- All keys: Successfully applying foundation training in real scenarios
- Group: Zero infections across all supervised missions

## Themes
- Proper foundation prevents disasters
- Early detection/rapid response prevent major tangles
- Not every tangle is healable (host cooperation required)
- Retreat is sometimes the right choice

## Success Metrics
- 100% mission completion rate (including proper aborts)
- Zero infections among keys
- Multiple hosts saved
- Group functions without supervision
