# Chapter 4 Summary

**Word Count**: 2,502

## Key Events
- Kira gives Marcus a resonance crystal to practice channeling before official training
- Marcus successfully manifests light for the first time (achieved in minutes vs days for most keys)
- Marcus dreams of being inside the Pattern and sees the tangle as a black corrupting thread
- First training session: 12 of 20 keys fail, Marcus passes and is noticed for having pre-awakened channels
- Marcus befriends Dmitri (Russian key, 6 months training) and Lily (Oregon girl, finally channeled after 2 months)

## Major Reveals
- A previous key learned to repair tangles instead of killing them and became a Mender
- The Veil-breaking tangle may be too corrupted (1000 years of spread) to repair
- Marcus has extensive channel networks (high capacity, high risk)
- Failed keys get reassigned to menial labor or medical treatment

## Character Development
- Marcus: Determined to find non-violent solution, progressing faster than normal
- Kira: More depth - helping Marcus because he reminds her of someone who found another way
- Dmitri: Friendly ally, has been training 6 months
- Lily: Young, struggled for 2 months before first success

## Threads Advanced
- Magic training begins successfully
- Potential allies identified
- Alternative to killing confirmed (but may not work for this tangle)
- Tangle visualized in dream as corrupting black thread

## Next: Chapter 5 will continue training progression
