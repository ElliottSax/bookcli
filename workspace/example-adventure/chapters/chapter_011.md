# Chapter 11

Pain woke Marcus.

Not the sharp pain of injury. Deeper. Like every channel in his body had been scraped raw and left to heal wrong.

He opened his eyes. Gray sky above. No—not sky. The underside of the Veil. Translucent energy stretching infinitely, still marked with faint scars where the cracks had been. But sealed. Whole.

He'd done it.

Marcus tried to sit up. His body protested. Every muscle screamed. His marked palm felt like someone had driven hot iron through it.

"Don't move." A woman's voice. Hoarse. Unfamiliar.

Marcus turned his head carefully. Twenty feet away, Lyara sat with her back against the bridge's low wall. Her dark hair hung loose around her face. Her eyes—brown, Marcus noticed, properly brown with white around them—looked at him with an expression somewhere between gratitude and horror.

"You're awake," she said.

"So are you." Marcus's voice came out as a croak. "How long?"

"Three hours. Maybe four." Lyara gestured vaguely at the Veil. "Time feels strange here. It might be longer."

Marcus finally managed to sit up. The bridge stretched in both directions, empty except for three people. Him. Lyara. And—

Thomas lay twenty feet in the other direction. Light hair plastered to his forehead. Eyes closed. Breathing shallow but steady.

"He hasn't woken yet," Lyara said quietly. "I've been... checking. Making sure he still breathes."

It was strange hearing her voice. Separate. Individual. After experiencing their merged consciousness, seeing them as distinct people felt wrong somehow.

"Do you remember?" Marcus asked. "Being fused?"

Lyara's expression darkened. "Every moment. All thousand years. It's still in here." She tapped her temple. "His thoughts. His memories. His feelings. I can't access them anymore, but I know they exist. Like phantom limbs."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be." She met his eyes. "You gave us back our minds. Our bodies. Our choice to be separate. That's more than I deserve after what I did."

"You were trying to save your relationship."

"I was trying to play god." Lyara's voice turned bitter. "a barrier and decided it shouldn't exist. Took forbidden magic and twisted it because better than everyone who came before. And I trapped us both in hell for a thousand years."

Marcus didn't have an answer for that.

They sat in silence for a while. The bridge hummed its constant vibration. Above them, the Veil pulsed with slow light.

"How did you do it?" Lyara asked finally. "The Weavers tried for centuries. Evan the Mender examined our pattern multiple times and said separation was impossible. But you—a boy who's been training for what, three weeks?—you did it in minutes."

"I cheated." Marcus flexed his marked palm carefully. The pain was excruciating. "I used a technique Evan mentioned but never demonstrated. Shared consciousness protocol. Let me see the binding from inside instead of trying to analyze it externally."

"And you risked permanent infection to do it."

"Yeah."

"Why?"

Marcus thought about that. About Kira's warning. About the Weavers' cold efficiency. About Evan's careful teachings. About his friends facing their own tangles right now.

"Because killing you would have been easier," he said finally. "And I'm tired of taking the easy way out being the only option."

Lyara laughed. Sharp, broken sound. "You sound like Thomas. He always said that. 'There has to be another way.' Even after we fused. Even after centuries of agony. He kept saying it."

She looked at Thomas's unconscious form.

"I gave up," she whispered. "Centuries ago. Stopped fighting. Stopped hoping. Death was all I wanted. But he kept believing we could be saved."

"He was right."

"He was a fool." But Lyara said it gently. "And I loved him for it."

Movement caught Marcus's attention. Thomas's fingers twitched. His eyes moved beneath closed lids.

Lyara noticed too. She stood—wobbled, caught herself against the wall—and moved toward him.

Marcus watched her kneel beside Thomas. Saw her reach out to touch his face, then hesitate. Her hand hovered inches from his skin.

"I don't know if I can," she said. "Touch him. After a thousand years of forced contact, the thought of choosing it..."

Thomas's eyes opened.

He stared at the Veil above. At Lyara kneeling beside him. At Marcus sitting across the bridge.

"We're separate," he breathed. "We're—Lyara, we're separate."

His hand found hers. Not fused. Not forced. Choosing.

Lyara flinched. Then, slowly, her fingers closed around his.

They sat like that. Two people who'd been one person holding hands like it was the first time.

Maybe it was.

Marcus looked away. Gave them privacy.

His return crystal pulsed in his pocket. Right. The emergency extraction tool. He was supposed to crush it when his mission was complete.

Mission complete. Tangle eliminated. Veil sealed.

Marcus pulled out the crystal. It glowed warm against his palm, pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat.

Crush it. Portal opens. Thirty seconds to get through.

He looked at Lyara and Thomas. They were talking quietly now. Relearning how to communicate without sharing thoughts. Fumbling through basic conversation like strangers.

"Can you walk?" Marcus called.

They both turned.

"Walk where?" Thomas asked.

"Back. To the Sanctum." Marcus held up the crystal. "This opens a portal. Emergency extraction. But it only stays open thirty seconds."

"We're coming with you?" Lyara looked surprised.

"You're not staying here."

"We don't know if the Weavers will let us leave. We're... what we did broke fundamental laws. Created a corruption that nearly destroyed two realities." Her voice dropped. "They might execute us for it."

"They might." Marcus stood carefully. His legs wobbled but held. "Or they might let you live. Either way, you're not staying on this bridge."

Thomas helped Lyara to her feet. They leaned on each other—not fused, choosing to support—and made their slow way to Marcus.

"Thank you," Thomas said when they reached him. "I don't have words for what you did. What you gave us. But thank you."

Marcus nodded. Raised the crystal. "Ready?"

"As we'll ever be," Lyara said.

Marcus crushed the crystal.

It shattered like glass. Violet energy poured from the fragments, forming a circle in the air. The portal tore open—golden light and familiar gray stone visible on the other side.

The Sanctum.

"Thirty seconds," Marcus said. "Go."

Thomas went first. Stepped through the portal and disappeared.

Lyara hesitated at the threshold. Looked back at the bridge. At the spot where they'd stood fused for a millennium.

"It's over," Marcus said gently.

"I know." She stepped through.

Marcus followed.

The portal transit was mercifully brief. One moment the bridge. Next moment solid stone beneath his feet.

The Sanctum's departure chamber. Six portal frames, five of them empty. The sixth—Marcus's—still glowing as the portal sealed behind him.

Weaver Elders stood in a semicircle. Five pale figures, cloaks merging with shadows.

And between them and Marcus, two other people.

Kira. Her gold eyes wide with shock as she stared at Marcus.

And Evan. The Mender's expression unreadable.

Marcus took one step forward. His legs gave out.

Kira caught him before he hit the floor.

"You absolute idiot," she breathed. "What did you do to your channels?"

"Saved them," Marcus managed. "Both of them."

Then consciousness faded, and Marcus let the darkness take him again.
