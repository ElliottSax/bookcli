# Chapter 14

Three weeks after Lily woke, Evan cleared Marcus for channeling.

"Start small," the Mender said, watching Marcus sit cross-legged in the training chamber. "No combat forms. No pattern diving. basic flow. Let me see how the channels respond."

Marcus closed his eyes. Drew energy from his core. Felt it move through the pathways the Binding had created.

Pain flared immediately. Not the sharp agony of torn channels, but a dull ache. Like scar tissue pulling when stretched.

"Discomfort or pain?" Evan asked.

"Discomfort."

"Good. That's normal. Keep going."

Marcus pushed the energy further. Up through his chest, down his right arm. His marked palm tingled as power pooled there.

He manifested light. His basic form. Gentle golden glow that show the chamber.

The ache intensified but didn't worsen. His channels held.

"Maintain it," Evan said. "Two minutes."

Marcus held the manifestation. Monitored his channels for signs of damage. The scar tissue pulled with each pulse of energy, but nothing tore. Nothing collapsed.

After two minutes, Evan nodded. "Release."

Marcus let the light fade. Slumped forward, breathing hard.

"Verdict?" he asked.

"Your channels are healed. Scarred, but functional." Evan pulled out a notebook, made annotations. "You'll always feel that ache when channeling. The scar tissue doesn't flex as smoothly as healthy channel. But you can work through it."

"So I can train again."

"You can train differently." Evan closed the notebook. "The Elders approved dual-path curriculum. Combat and Mending. I'll teach you both. But we're starting from scratch."

"I already know pattern reading. Shared consciousness protocol. Surgical cutting—"

"You know theory. Some practical application under extreme duress." Evan's voice was firm. "But you don't know fundamentals. The building blocks that let you apply techniques safely. Consistently. Without nearly dying every time."

Marcus opened his mouth to argue. Stopped. Evan was right. He'd succeeded on the Veil tangle through desperation and luck. Lily had nearly died trying to replicate his methods without proper foundation.

"What are the fundamentals?" he asked.

"Pattern sensitivity. Thread discrimination. Corruption assessment. Energy regulation. Surgical precision. Emergency protocols." Evan ticked them off on his fingers. "Six core skills. Master those, and you can attempt any technique safely. Skip them, and you're gambling with your life and your patient's."

"How long?"

"To master? Years. To achieve competency?" Evan considered. "Six months. Maybe eight."

Six months. Marcus had saved the Veil in minutes. But those minutes had cost him weeks of recovery and nearly cost Lily her life.

"Teach me," he said.

* * *

The training was nothing like what Marcus expected.

No dramatic pattern dives. No emergency surgeries on dying patients. No combat against corrupted entities.

Instead, Evan had him sit in a quiet room for hours. Eyes closed. Channeling minimal energy. Learning to feel the difference between thread types without visual confirmation.

"Life threads feel warm," Evan explained on the second day. "Memory threads cooler. Emotional connections pulse. Physical bonds are solid, static. You need to distinguish them by sensation alone."

Marcus extended his awareness into a pattern fragment—a small section of healthy weave preserved in crystal. Felt the threads without looking.

There. Warmth. A life thread connecting this person to... a child? No, multiple children. Family bonds.

And there. Cool, flowing. Memories of learning. Education. Years of accumulated knowledge.

And there. Pulsing, irregular. An emotional connection. Love? No, deeper. Parent-child bond. The life thread's source.

"I feel them," Marcus said. "Three different types. Life, memory, emotion."

"Good. Now tell me which one is corrupted."

Marcus froze. "There's corruption?"

"Minute amount. Barely detectable. But present. Find it."

He pushed deeper. Examined each thread carefully. The life threads felt healthy. The memories were intact. The emotional bond...

There. A tiny discoloration. Not black like the major corruptions he'd seen. wrong. Like a note played a half-step flat.

"The emotional bond. Parent mourning a child who died."

"Correct." Evan removed the crystal. "That fragment came from Aria. The grief connection to her daughter. Healed years ago, but a trace remains. You felt it."

Over the following days, Marcus learned to detect corruption in dozens of fragments. Fresh versus old. Active versus dormant. Malignant versus benign. Surface versus deep.

Each fragment taught him nuance. Showed him patterns he'd missed in his rushed Veil surgery.

"The tangle you healed was obvious," Evan said during week two. "Massive. Thousand years old. Impossible to miss. But most tangles start small. Subtle. A key who can't detect early corruption will fail before they realize they're in danger."

Like Lily. She'd entered an active tangle without recognizing the host's entire pattern was infected. By the time she realized, it was too late.

Marcus would not make that mistake again.

* * *

Week three brought combat integration.

The Weaver instructor who'd taught Marcus to manifest blades returned. Tall, cloaked, faceless as always.

*You have learned to heal,* it said telepathically. *Now you must learn when NOT to heal. When destruction is mercy.*

The training chamber filled with illusions. Corrupted figures. Some partially infected—saveable with quick intervention. Others too far gone, entire patterns rotted beyond recovery.

*Assess. Decide. Act. You have three seconds.*

An illusion lunged. Marcus extended his awareness. Read its pattern in a flash.

Seventy percent corrupted. Brain threads infected. Identity dissolved. Nothing left to save.

He manifested his blade. Cut the corruption's source thread. The illusion dissolved.

*Adequate. Next.*

Another figure. This one stumbling, black veins spreading slowly. Marcus read it.

Thirty percent corrupted. Localized infection. Hasn't reached critical threads yet. Saveable.

He channeled healing energy. Reinforced healthy threads around the infection. Contained the spread.

*Too slow. In combat, that delay costs lives. Again.*

They drilled for hours. Assess, decide, act. Three seconds. Over and over until Marcus's channels ached and his head pounded.

But he improved. His assessment time dropped from five seconds to four to three to two.

By week four, he could distinguish saveable from unsaveable in under a second. Could switch between healing and cutting without conscious thought.

*Better,* the Weaver said. *You are becoming functional. Not expert. But functional.*

High praise from a Weaver.

* * *

Week five brought surgical precision training.

Evan had Marcus practice thread separation on increasingly complex tangles. Not live ones—preserved fragments of healed tangles, frozen at various stages of infection.

"You need to cut exactly the right thread," Evan explained. "Too much, and you kill the host unnecessarily. Too little, and the corruption spreads. Find the minimum intervention point."

Marcus worked on a fragment showing two threads fused improperly. A minor tangle—someone who'd tried to bind their pattern to another's out of obsessive love. Not fusion magic like Lyara's. desperate human attachment gone wrong.

He traced the corruption back. Found where the two patterns connected.

Three threads bound them. Emotion, memory, and magical resonance.

The corruption stemmed from the magical thread. The forced resonance creating dissonance that spread to both patterns.

Cut that one thread, and the other two would stabilize. The people could remain emotionally connected, share memories, but without the corrupting magical fusion.

Marcus manifested his finest cutting edge. Positioned it precisely against the magical thread.

Held his breath.

Cut.

The thread severed cleanly. The corruption stopped spreading. The fragment stabilized.

"Perfect," Evan said. "That's a minimum intervention cut. Both patients survive. Relationship survives. Only the corrupting element removed."

Marcus stared at the fragment. At the two patterns now separate but still connected by healthy threads.

"This is what I should have taught Lily," he said quietly. "How to find minimum intervention points. Not 'try to heal' but 'heal this specific thread, cut that specific connection.'"

"Yes." Evan's voice was gentle. "Specificity matters. 'Try to heal' is too vague. 'Contain the infection, assess the primary corruption point, attempt separation if time allows, cut if spreading continues' is a protocol."

"Can I teach the others? Now that I know how?"

"When you've mastered it yourself. Not before." Evan pulled out another fragment. "You're competent at basics. Not yet skilled enough to teach. That comes later."

Marcus accepted that. Turned his attention to the next fragment.

This one showed a three-way connection. Two lovers and a child, bound in unhealthy codependence. The corruption spread through all three patterns simultaneously.

"Find the minimum intervention," Evan said.

Marcus got to work.

By week six, the other keys started watching.

Dmitri came first. Stood at the training chamber's edge, observing Marcus switch between healing and cutting. Assessment and action. Precision and speed.

"You're different," Dmitri said after the session ended. "More controlled."

"Evan's teaching fundamentals. The stuff I skipped before."

"Could he teach us?"

Marcus looked at Evan, who nodded .

"He could," Marcus said. "But you'd need to commit. It's not fast. It's not dramatic. It's hours of sitting still, feeling threads, learning discrimination."

"But it works."

"It works."

Dmitri considered this. "I'll talk to the others. See who wants to learn."

Two days later, all four returned. Dmitri, Jin, Paulo, Sarai. Even Lily came, still pale from her recovery but determined.

"We want what you have," Sarai said. "Options. The ability to choose healing or cutting based on assessment, not defaulting to blades."

Evan looked at Marcus. "Your call. You're far enough along to assist with basic instruction. If you teach them pattern sensitivity, I'll handle the advanced work."

Marcus thought about Lily. About incomplete teaching leading to near-death. About his own rushed success followed by costly failures.

"Only if we do it right," he said. "Slow. Careful. Foundation first. No one attempts field work until they're ready."

"Agreed," Evan said.

The five keys nodded.

"Then let's begin," Marcus said.

* * *

Teaching felt different from learning.

Marcus guided them through the same exercises Evan had shown him. Thread discrimination. Corruption detection. Pattern sensitivity.

They struggled at first. Dmitri kept defaulting to combat assessment—threat level, attack pattern, weak points. Jin phased unconsciously whenever he sensed corruption, a defensive reflex he had to unlearn.

But slowly, they improved.

Lily picked it up fastest, her near-death experience giving her visceral understanding of what she was learning to detect. She could distinguish active from dormant corruption after three days.

Paulo had natural talent for structural assessment. Could identify weak points in pattern architecture where corruption would spread fastest.

Sarai excelled at containment. Building temporary barriers around healthy threads to buy time for surgical intervention.

Jin's phase abilities gave him unique perspective. He could partially shift into pattern-space, seeing threads from angles Marcus couldn't access.

And Dmitri brought combat discipline. Turned assessment drills into timed exercises, pushed everyone to faster decision-making.

Together, they learned what Marcus had learned alone.

That healing was possible. That cutting was sometimes necessary. That wisdom lay in knowing the difference.

By the end of week six, all five could perform basic corruption assessment. Could distinguish saveable from unsaveable. Could articulate intervention strategies.

"They're ready for supervised field work," Evan told Marcus privately. "Small tangles. Controlled environments. With you or me observing."

"Already?"

"They have foundation you lacked. Started slow, built properly, learned from your mistakes." Evan smiled. "That's the advantage of being second generation. The pioneer pays the cost. The followers benefit from hard-won knowledge."

Marcus thought about that. About his near-death on the Veil. About Lily's infection. About the price of learning through necessity.

"Then let's make sure their first missions go better than ours did," he said.

Evan nodded. "Agreed."
