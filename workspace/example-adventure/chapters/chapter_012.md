# Chapter 12

Marcus woke to green light.

Not the golden light of his own channeling. Not the violet corruption from the fusion. Gentle green—Evan's healing color.

He opened his eyes. The Mender wing's familiar ceiling. Soft amber lamps. The smell of healing herbs.

"Welcome back," Evan said. He sat beside Marcus's bed, hands glowing faintly as they hovered over Marcus's chest. "Third time's the charm, hopefully."

"Third time?"

"You've woken twice before. Passed out again immediately both times." Evan's expression was difficult to read. "Your channels are a disaster. What possessed you to use your own pattern as a buffer against that discharge?"

"It was the only way to prevent violent separation."

"It nearly killed you."

"But it worked."

Evan sighed. Pulled his hands back. The green light faded. "Yes. It worked. You separated a thousand-year-old fusion that I declared impossible to heal. Used a technique I mentioned once in passing. Risked permanent infection. And brought both victims back alive."

He leaned back in his chair.

"You're either brilliant or incredibly reckless."

"Can't I be both?"

A slight smile. "Kira said the same thing. She's been checking on you every hour. Had to physically drag her out so you could rest without her hovering."

Marcus tried to sit up. Pain lanced through his chest. Not physical—deeper. His channels protesting movement.

"Easy," Evan said. "Your channel network is severely strained. Think of it like muscles torn in a dozen places. They'll heal, but slowly. And you need to avoid channeling until they do."

"How long?"

"Weeks. Maybe months." Evan's voice was firm. "If you try to channel before they're healed, you risk permanent damage. Scar tissue forming in the channels. Reduced capacity. Chronic pain. In the worst case, total channel collapse."

Weeks. Marcus had friends on missions. The war could restart. The Veil could fail again.

"I can't wait weeks."

"You don't have a choice." Evan stood. Moved to a cabinet and pulled out a small vial of dark liquid. "This will help with the pain. Accelerate healing . But there's no shortcut for this damage, Marcus. You pushed beyond your limits. Now you pay the cost."

Marcus took the vial. Drank. The liquid tasted like ash and copper.

"Lyara and Thomas?" he asked.

"Recovering. The Weavers separated them—different chambers for now. Physical health is fine. Psychological trauma will take longer to address." Evan returned to his seat. "They've been asking about you. Want to thank you properly once you're stable."

"The Weavers—what will they do to them?"

"That's being deliberated. The Elders are... divided." Evan's expression darkened. "Some want execution. What Lyara did broke fundamental laws. Created corruption that threatened two realities. Set a dangerous precedent."

"And the others?"

"Argue that punishing someone for a thousand-year-old crime when they've already suffered a thousand years is pointless cruelty. That allowing them to recover and contribute would serve the pattern better than killing them."

Marcus's hands clenched. "If they execute them after I risked everything to save them—"

"You'll what?" Evan's voice was gentle but firm. "You can barely sit up. You can't channel for weeks. You have no use here, Marcus."

He was right. Marcus hated that he was right.

"When do they decide?"

"Soon. The Elders want to address your mission first. You're expected in the judgment chamber when you can walk."

"I can walk now."

"You can barely breathe without pain. Give it another day at least."

Marcus wanted to argue. But another wave of pain from his channels convinced him Evan was right.

"The other keys," Marcus said. "Dmitri, Lily, the others. Have they returned?"

Evan's expression closed off. "That's not my information to share. The Elders will tell you."

Which meant something had gone wrong.

Marcus lay back. Closed his eyes. Tried not to imagine his friends facing corruptions alone. Tried not to picture Lily freezing up. Dmitri pushing too hard. Jin getting infected like he had in training.

"Rest," Evan said quietly. "You did the impossible. Let that be enough for now."

* * *

Two days later, Marcus stood before the Weaver Elders.

The judgment chamber was circular. Black stone walls carved with patterns that hurt to look at directly. Five Elders stood in a semicircle, their cloaks merging into shadow.

Marcus stood in the center. Kira had helped him walk here, but she'd been dismissed before the doors sealed.

To his left, Lyara and Thomas stood together. Not touching. Separate. Both looking at the floor.

*Marcus Chen,* the center Elder's telepathic voice filled his mind. *You were sent to eliminate the Veil corruption. To cut the source thread and seal the breach.*

"I did seal the breach."

*By methods not authorized. You employed Mender techniques. Shared consciousness protocol. Risked permanent infection. Brought the corruption sources back to the Sanctum alive.*

"I saved them. They weren't corruption sources. They were victims."

*They created the corruption. Lyara's forbidden magic—*

"A thousand years ago. She's suffered punishment beyond anything you could inflict. They both have."

The Elders were silent. Marcus couldn't read their expressions—they had no faces, no tells.

Finally, a different Elder spoke. *Your actions defied our explicit instructions. Keys are weapons. Tools to eliminate threats efficiently. You chose sentiment over results.*

"I chose to heal instead of kill. And the result is the same—the Veil is sealed. The corruption is gone. But two people are alive who you would have executed."

*Two people who committed crimes against reality itself.*

"Who have paid for those crimes. A thousand years of torment. That's not justice—that's torture."

*The pattern does not recognize mercy.*

"Then maybe the pattern is wrong."

The chamber went deathly silent.

Marcus felt it immediately—his words crossing some fundamental line. You didn't challenge the Elders. Didn't question the pattern. Keys who did that disappeared.

But he'd already crossed that line. Might as well see it through.

"Evan taught me that the pattern has flexibility," Marcus continued. "That tangles can be healed if you understand the wound instead of cutting everything away. I proved that works. On the biggest tangle anyone's seen in a thousand years."

He gestured to Lyara and Thomas.

"They're evidence. Living proof that Mender techniques scale. That healing is possible. If you execute them now, you're throwing away everything we learned. Everything their suffering could teach us about preventing future tangles."

*They are dangerous. Lyara possesses knowledge of forbidden magic. Thomas carries equal resonance across the Veil. Together they could attempt fusion again.*

"Then separate them. Send Thomas to Earth. Keep Lyara here. Monitor them. Use them. But don't kill them when they could help prevent others from making the same mistake."

More silence.

Then, unexpectedly, Thomas spoke.

"I don't want to be separated again."

Everyone turned to him.

He looked at Lyara. "A thousand years together. A thousand years of forced intimacy. It should have made me hate her. Should have destroyed whatever love existed. But it didn't."

His voice shook.

"She made a terrible choice. Broke laws. Created suffering. But she did it because she loved me. And I loved her. Still do. After everything."

Lyara's eyes filled with tears.

"If you're going to execute us," Thomas continued, "at least let us die together. No more separation. Please."

The center Elder tilted its head. *You would choose death together over life apart?*

"We've had enough separation to last a thousand lifetimes."

Lyara reached for his hand. Found it. Held tight.

The Elders conferred silently. Marcus couldn't hear their telepathic conversation. Could only watch their cloaked forms shift .

Finally, the center Elder spoke again.

*We will not execute you.*

Relief flooded through Marcus. Through Lyara and Thomas from the look on their faces.

*However,* the Elder continued. *You cannot remain free. Lyara will be bound—a magical restriction preventing channel use beyond basic survival functions. Thomas will wear a resonance dampener. Both of you will serve the Sanctum. Work in whatever capacity we determine. Under constant supervision.*

"For how long?" Lyara asked quietly.

*Until we deem you trustworthy. Or until you die. Whichever comes first.*

"So we're prisoners."

*You are alive. That is more mercy than your crime warranted.*

Thomas squeezed Lyara's hand. "We accept."

The Elder turned to Marcus.

*And you. Marcus Chen. You have proven unconventional methods can succeed. Have demonstrated Mender techniques at scale. Have saved lives we expected to sacrifice.*

Marcus waited.

*You will continue your training. But under modified protocols. Evan will teach you advanced Mending alongside standard key combat. You will learn both paths. Healing and cutting. And you will choose which to employ based on assessment—not sentiment.*

"That's... that's what I want to do. What I've been trying to do."

*Then we agree. Rare occurrence.* The Elder's telepathic voice held something that might have been amusement. *However. Your channel damage requires healing time. You will remain in the Sanctum. No missions. No advanced training. Only recovery and basic education until Evan clears you.*

"The other keys. My friends. Are they—"

*Four returned successfully. One did not.*

Marcus's heart dropped. "Who?"

*Lily.*

No. Not Lily. The water girl who didn't want to kill anyone. Who practiced healing techniques with him. Who'd been terrified of freezing up.

"What happened?"

*Her mission was underwater corruption. The host drowned herself repeatedly attempting to resurrect a deceased family member. Lily attempted healing as you taught her. The corruption infected her. She did not crush her return crystal in time.*

"Is she alive?"

*Unknown. We lost her signal three days ago. A recovery team has been dispatched.*

Three days. Lily could be dead. Could be corrupted. Could be trapped in some underwater hell because Marcus taught her to try healing instead of cutting.

"I want to go. Help find her."

*Your channels are damaged. You would be liability, not asset. You will remain here. That is final.*

The Elder gestured. The chamber doors opened.

*You are dismissed. Lyara and Thomas will be processed. Marcus will return to the Mender wing for continued recovery.*

Marcus wanted to argue. Wanted to demand they let him help. But his channels throbbed with pain. His legs barely held him upright. Evan was right. The Elders were right.

He was useless.

Kira appeared at the door. Helped him walk out.

Behind them, Weavers moved to bind Lyara and place Thomas's dampener.

And somewhere, Lily was lost in corruption Marcus had inadvertently encouraged her to face.

The victory felt hollow now.

He'd saved two lives.

But lost one that mattered more.
