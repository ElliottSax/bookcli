# Chapter 16

Marcus's first solo assignment arrived at dawn.

A Weaver Elder handed him a sealed scroll. Inside: coordinates, basic assessment, mission parameters.

Target: Medium-complexity tangle. Host attempting to resurrect spouse. Corruption spreading to family members through shared grief. Estimated sixty percent infection in primary host, thirty percent in secondary hosts (two children).

Recommended approach: Containment and surgical separation. Host cooperation uncertain.

Time limit: Eight hours before corruption becomes irreversible in children.

Marcus read the scroll twice. This was beyond anything they'd handled in supervised missions. Multiple hosts. Cascading corruption. Children at risk.

The tangle that required every skill he'd learned.

He gathered his equipment. Return crystal. Medical supplies. Pattern fragments for reference. The tools Evan had drilled into him were mental, but physical backup never hurt.

"First solo," Kira said, finding him in the equipment room. "Nervous?"

"Terrified."

"Good. Means you're taking it seriously." She handed him an earpiece. "Emergency channel. If it goes bad, call. Evan or I will extract you."

"The protocol says—"

"I know what the protocol says. I also know you'll push past limits if you think you can save someone." Her gold eyes were serious. "Don't die proving a point, Marcus. Some tangles can't be healed."

He pocketed the earpiece. "I'll be careful."

"You'll be reckless. But you'll be careful about it." She squeezed his shoulder. "Come back."

* * *

The portal dropped Marcus in a small town. Rural. Maybe two hundred people. The place where everyone knew everyone's business.

Which meant everyone would know about the corruption.

Marcus extended his awareness. Found the tangle immediately—a house on the edge of town, pulsing with dark energy. Three patterns inside. One heavily corrupted, two moderately infected.

He approached carefully. Assessed from outside first, like training taught.

Primary host: Male. Forties. Grief binding attempt on dead spouse. Seventy percent corrupted—worse than the scroll indicated. The infection had accelerated.

Secondary hosts: Two children. Boy maybe ten, girl maybe twelve. Thirty-five percent corrupted through resonance with their father. The shared grief creating conduit for spread.

Eight hours until irreversible damage. But at current acceleration, Marcus had maybe six.

He knocked.

A man answered. Gaunt. Hollow-eyed. Black veins visible on his neck and hands. He looked at Marcus without real focus.

"Who are you?"

"A Mender. The Weavers sent me. You're infected with pattern corruption from grief magic. So are your children. I'm here to help."

"I don't need help. I need my wife back."

"She's dead. What you're trying to hold onto is rotting. And it's spreading to your kids. Taking them with you."

The man's expression hardened. "Leave."

Marcus didn't move. "Your children are dying. Slowly. The corruption you created is eating through their patterns. They have maybe six hours before the damage becomes permanent. Brain threads will rot. Identity will dissolve. They'll become shells."

"You're lying."

"Check them. Extend your awareness. You have enough magical sensitivity to have attempted resurrection—you can sense corruption."

The man hesitated. Then turned inward.

Marcus watched realization dawn in his eyes. Horror replacing denial.

"No. No, I was careful. I only bound her thread to mine. Not theirs."

"Grief doesn't exist in isolation. Your children share your loss. When you created the binding, you created resonance. Their grief patterns connected to yours, and the corruption spread through the link."

The man slumped against the doorframe. "I was trying to bring her back."

"You were trying to refuse reality. And reality doesn't allow that without cost." Marcus softened his voice. "Let me help. I can separate the bindings. Remove the corruption before it kills all three of you."

"Will it bring her back?"

"No. She'll still be dead."

"Then what's the point?"

"The point is your children get to live. Get to grieve naturally. Get to heal without corruption eating their minds."

The man looked back into the house. At his children, presumably. When he turned back, his eyes were wet.

"Will it hurt them?"

"Yes. Like any wound being cleaned. But less than dying slowly over six hours."

He stepped aside. "Do it."

* * *

Inside, the children sat on a couch. Both stared at nothing, black veins spreading across their faces. The corruption had progressed since Marcus's external assessment.

Five hours. Maybe less.

"I need your cooperation," Marcus told the father. "Your binding is the source. If I cut it while you're fighting me, the backlash could kill you. I need you to let go. Accept that she's gone."

"I don't know if I can."

"You have to. For them." Marcus gestured to the children. "They're suffering because you won't release your grip. Choose them over a ghost."

The man closed his eyes. Tears streamed down his corrupted cheeks.

Marcus extended his awareness. Read the full pattern.

Worse than he thought. The father's grief thread connected to his dead wife's corpse-pattern—three years of decay maintained through magic. That thread had spawned secondary connections to both children, creating a web of corruption.

Three-point tangle. Marcus had trained on similar structures, but never one this advanced. Never one with children's lives at stake.

Protocol: Contain first. Then separate primary binding. Finally sever secondary connections.

But the children were deteriorating fast. By the time he contained and worked on the father, they might be past saving.

Marcus made a choice.

He'd work on all three simultaneously.

Risky. Splitting his attention. But the only way to save them all.

Marcus channeled. His scarred channels ached immediately, but he pushed through. Manifested containment barriers around all three patterns. Stopped the corruption from spreading further.

The father gasped. The children's eyes focused .

"I'm buying time," Marcus explained. "Now I need to cut. All three bindings at once. It's going to hurt all of you simultaneously. Can you handle that?"

The father looked at his children. At the black veins receding under containment. At the chance to save them.

"Do it."

Marcus extended his awareness fully. Saw all three threads. The primary grief binding from father to wife. The secondary resonance connections from children to father.

Three threads. Three surgical cuts. All simultaneous.

He manifested three cutting edges. Positioned them precisely. This was beyond anything Evan had taught. Beyond solo mission parameters. But it was necessary.

"On three," Marcus warned. "One. Two. Three."

Cut.

All three threads severed simultaneously.

The man screamed. The children convulsed. Marcus immediately channeled healing energy—not into the severed areas, but around them. Strengthening healthy threads. Preventing shock damage.

His channels burned. The scar tissue tore . Pain lanced through his marked palm.

But he held. Maintained healing. Kept all three patterns stable while they adjusted to sudden separation.

Thirty seconds. One minute. Two.

The black veins faded. The corruption stopped spreading. Became dormant scar tissue.

Marcus released his channeling. Collapsed against the wall, breathing hard.

The father sobbed on the floor. The children blinked, awareness returning to their eyes.

"Dad?" the girl said. Confused. "Why are you crying?"

"Your mother," he choked. "She's... I can't feel her anymore."

The boy looked at his sister. Then at his father. Then, slowly, moved to hug him.

"She's been gone for three years," the boy said quietly. "You've been holding onto a ghost."

They grieved together. Real grief this time. Not corrupted by magical binding. Natural pain that would heal instead of rot.

Marcus watched them. Made sure the patterns remained stable. The corruption stayed dormant. The surgical cuts sealed properly.

After ten minutes, he stood.

"The immediate corruption is cleansed," he told the father. "But you all have scarring. Psychological trauma. You'll need follow-up treatment. Real therapy, not magic."

The man nodded, still holding his children. "Thank you. You saved them."

"You saved them. By letting go when it mattered."

Marcus left the house. Crushed his return crystal. Stepped through the portal.

Back to the Sanctum. Back to report success.

His first solo mission. Complete.

* * *

Evan was waiting in the departure chamber.

"Status?" he asked.

"Mission complete. All three hosts cleansed. Primary corruption severed. Secondary infections removed. Scarring minimal." Marcus paused. "I... may have exceeded parameters ."

"How ?"

"I worked on all three simultaneously instead of sequentially. To save time before the children's corruption became irreversible."

Evan's expression was unreadable. "That's advanced technique. Parallel processing. You're not trained for that."

"I had foundation. I adapted."

"You improvised."

"Yes."

"And it worked?"

"Yes."

Evan nodded slowly. "Then you've graduated from competent to skilled. Adaptation while maintaining protocol—that's the mark of a practitioner who understands principles, not procedures."

Marcus hadn't expected praise. "I tore my channel scarring . Pushed too hard."

"I'll heal it. But you recognized the necessity. Made the calculated risk. Succeeded without corrupting yourself or killing the hosts." Evan smiled. "That's what dual-path training produces. Keys who can think, not execute."

Over the next week, the other keys completed their solo missions.

Lily handled a grief corruption. Got host cooperation. Performed clean surgical cut. Returned without complications.

Dmitri faced a hostile tangle. Assessed it as too dangerous. Aborted and called for Weaver backup. Followed protocol perfectly.

Jin and Paulo partnered on a complex fusion. Separated it successfully. Both survivors intact.

Sarai tackled an emotional binding in a family of four. Worked methodically through each connection. All four hosts lived.

Six keys. Six successful outcomes. Zero infections.

The new generation was functional.

"Tomorrow you get standard assignments," Evan announced. "Same as veteran keys. No more 'in training' designation. You're full practitioners now."

The six looked at each other. Pride. Relief. Exhaustion.

They'd done it. Learned both paths. Mastered the balance.

Marcus thought about his mother. Still in Vermont, thinking he'd disappeared two months ago. The portal that had sealed. The life he'd left behind.

He couldn't go back. The Binding made that impossible. But maybe—maybe someday the Weavers would let him contact her. Let her know he was alive.

For now, he had a new life. A purpose. A path forward.

As Kira had promised, he'd become something more than what he'd been.

A key. A mender. A bridge between worlds.

And that would have to be enough.
