# Chapter 15

The first supervised mission came two days later.

Marcus stood with Evan in a forest clearing, watching as Lily and Dmitri approached a small farmhouse. The structure looked normal from outside—weathered wood, slanted roof, garden plot—but Marcus could sense the corruption from here.

A minor tangle. Someone inside had attempted amateur magic. Created a small knot in their pattern that was slowly spreading.

"Remember the protocol," Evan said quietly. Lily and Dmitri both wore earpieces that let them hear him. "Assess before entry. Identify corruption type. Determine if host is conscious and cooperative."

Lily extended her awareness. Marcus watched her pattern-sense ripple outward, touching the house's edges.

"One person inside," she reported. "Female. Late fifties. Corruption localized to emotional threads. Active spread but slow. Maybe thirty percent infected."

"Source?" Evan prompted.

"Grief binding. She's trying to maintain connection to someone dead. The thread's rotting."

Dmitri circled the house, checking approaches. "One entrance. No defensive wards. Host doesn't seem aware we're here."

"Threat assessment?" Evan asked.

"Low. Corruption hasn't reached physical or magical combat threads. She won't fight back effectively even if she tries."

"Intervention strategy?"

Lily and Dmitri exchanged glances. Planning.

"Containment first," Lily said. "I'll build barriers around healthy emotional threads. Stop the spread while Dmitri locates the dead-thread connection."

"Then surgical cut," Dmitri added. "Sever the rotting thread. Minimal intervention."

"If the host resists?"

"I retreat," Lily said firmly. "Dmitri maintains containment. We reassess. If she fights actively, we abort and request extraction."

Evan nodded. "Proceed."

They entered the house.

Marcus extended his own awareness to observe. Not interfering, but watching. Ready to intervene if things went wrong.

Inside, an older woman sat in a rocking chair, holding a photograph. Black veins spread up her arms—visible corruption that had progressed further than Lily initially assessed.

"Reassess," Evan's voice in their earpieces. "Visible corruption means it's advanced past thirty percent."

Lily focused. "Correcting. Fifty percent. Possibly sixty. It's accelerated recently."

"Do you abort?"

Marcus saw Lily hesitate. This was the decision point. The moment she'd failed at before. Push forward into dangerous territory or retreat to safety.

"Checking critical threads," she said. Decision deferred while gathering data. Smart.

She traced the corruption's path. Emotional threads severely damaged. Some memory threads infected. But cognitive function intact. Identity preserved. Physical health unaffected.

"Host is saveable," Lily determined. "Corruption hasn't reached point of no return. But window is closing. Request permission to proceed with accelerated protocol."

"Granted," Evan said. "Dmitri, primary intervention. Lily, full containment and support."

They moved.

Dmitri approached the woman. "Ma'am. We're here to help you. You've been infected by corruption from grief magic. Do you understand?"

The woman looked up. Her eyes were clouded but aware. "My daughter. I can still feel her. If I let go, she's gone forever."

"She's already gone," Dmitri said gently. "What you're holding onto isn't her. It's decay wearing her shape. And it's killing you."

"I don't care."

There it was. The resistance. The host who didn't want to be saved.

Marcus tensed. This was where Lily had failed before. Where the host's refusal to cooperate led to infection during attempted healing.

But Lily didn't rush in. Didn't try to force healing on an unwilling subject.

Instead, she activated containment. Barriers sprang up around the woman's healthy threads—not attacking, not invading. Protective walls preventing the corruption from spreading further.

The woman gasped. "What are you—"

"Buying time," Lily said. "The corruption is contained. It can't spread for the next few minutes. But it's still rotting the threads it's already infected. We need to remove it."

"No. I need—"

"You need to live," Dmitri interrupted. "Your daughter wouldn't want you dying for a ghost. Would she?"

The woman's face crumpled. Tears streamed down her corrupted cheeks.

"She was seven. Fever took her. I couldn't save her. I'm a healer—I fix people—and I couldn't save my own daughter."

Lily knelt beside the chair. "You tried to keep her alive through magic. Bound your grief to her memory. Created a connection that shouldn't exist."

"her. For three years, her presence. Like she wasn't completely gone."

"That wasn't her," Lily said softly. "That was your grief pattern mimicking her. And it's been rotting this whole time. Poisoning your ability to remember her clearly. To heal properly."

"If I let go, I have nothing left."

"You have memories," Dmitri said. "Real ones. Not corrupted by magical binding. Let us remove the infection, and you can remember her as she was. Not as a ghost slowly turning to poison."

The woman looked between them. At the black veins on her arms. At the photograph in her hands.

"Will it hurt?"

"Yes," Dmitri said honestly. "Like reopening a wound to clean out infection. But then it can heal properly."

She closed her eyes. "Do it."

Lily nodded to Dmitri. He moved behind the woman, placed his hands on her shoulders. Extended his awareness into her pattern.

Marcus watched him work. Precise. Methodical. Following the protocols exactly as taught.

Dmitri traced the corruption to its source. The grief thread connecting the woman to her daughter's corpse-pattern. Three years of magical connection turning love into poison.

He manifested his cutting edge. Not a broad blade. A surgical instrument. Fine enough to sever a single thread without touching the ones beside it.

"Severance in three," he warned. "Two. One."

Cut.

The thread snapped. The woman screamed.

Lily immediately channeled healing energy. Not into the severed area—that needed to scar naturally. But into the surrounding threads, strengthening them. Preventing shock damage from the sudden separation.

The black veins on the woman's arms faded. Not completely. Scar tissue remained. But the active corruption stopped spreading. Stopped rotting. Became dormant damage instead of living infection.

The woman slumped in her chair, sobbing.

"It's done," Dmitri said. "The binding is severed. Your natural grief can heal now."

"I can't feel her anymore."

"No. But you can remember her without the poison."

Lily maintained healing channeling for another minute. Then carefully withdrew. "Physical corruption is cleansed. Emotional scarring will take time to heal naturally. But you'll survive."

The woman looked at the photograph. Her daughter's face smiled up at her, frozen in healthier memory.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Outside, Marcus released the breath he'd been holding.

"Assessment?" Evan asked as Lily and Dmitri emerged.

"Successful intervention," Dmitri reported. "Host cooperative after initial resistance. Corruption severed cleanly. No complications."

"Lily?"

"Containment held. Healing protocols applied correctly. Patient stable." She paused. "I didn't freeze. Didn't rush. Made the right calls."

"You did," Evan confirmed. "Both of you followed protocol perfectly. Assessed accurately. Adapted when corruption level changed. Got host cooperation before intervention. This is how it's supposed to work."

Lily's shoulders sagged with relief.

Marcus approached. "You knew when to push and when to pull back. When I taught you before, I didn't explain that part. The reading of the host's willingness. The conversation before intervention."

"Evan drilled it into us," Lily said. "Never force healing on someone actively fighting. Either get cooperation or abort. Fighting the host and the corruption simultaneously is how you get infected."

Like she had before. But not this time.

"Mission complete," Evan said. "Return to Sanctum for debriefing."

* * *

Over the next two weeks, the supervised missions continued.

Jin and Paulo handled a structural tangle—someone who'd attempted to reinforce their home's foundation with magic and corrupted their physical threads in the process. They assessed, determined the host was unconscious but stable, and performed minimum intervention surgery. Both survived.

Sarai and Marcus partnered on an emotional binding—two friends who'd magically sworn an oath of loyalty and created corrupting resonance. They separated the magical component while preserving the natural friendship. Both relationships and patterns intact.

Dmitri and Lily tackled another grief corruption, this one more advanced. The host was hostile, actively fighting. They aborted after Dmitri took a minor infection trying to containment. Evan cleansed him immediately, and they called in a full Weaver team to handle forced intervention.

"Not every tangle is healable," Evan explained during debrief. "Sometimes the host is too far gone. Too resistant. Too dangerous. Knowing when to abort is as important as knowing when to intervene."

Dmitri touched the silver scar on his arm where Evan had cut away the infection. "it spreading. Pulled back immediately like trained. Didn't try to push through."

"Exactly right," Evan said. "Your brother died because he pushed past that point. You lived because you recognized it."

Paulo and Jin handled a fusion attempt—two lovers trying to create Lyara-style binding. They caught it early, within hours of initiation. Separated the threads before corruption set in. Both lovers survived with only minor scarring.

"This is what Lyara and Thomas would have needed," Marcus observed afterward. "Intervention before the corruption took hold. Surgical separation in the first hours instead of forced fusion for a thousand years."

"Yes," Evan said. "Early detection and rapid response. That's how you prevent major tangles."

By week eight since Marcus's initial recovery, all six keys had completed multiple successful missions. Had learned to assess, adapt, and act. To heal when possible, cut when necessary, and abort when prudent.

They'd become functional keys. Not experts. Not masters. But competent practitioners who understood both paths.

"Tomorrow you get your first solo assignments," Evan announced during final training. "No supervision. No backup unless you call for it. You'll be on your own."

The six keys exchanged glances.

"Are we ready?" Lily asked quietly.

Evan smiled. "You're as ready as anyone can be after two months of training. The rest you learn by doing."

Marcus thought about that. About his rushed mission to the Veil. About succeeding through desperation and luck.

These five had foundation he'd lacked. Protocols he'd invented through necessity. Support he'd wished for.

They were ready.

Or at least, they wouldn't make his mistakes.

That would have to be enough.
