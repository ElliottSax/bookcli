# Chapter 4

Sleep didn't come.

Marcus lay on the narrow bed in his alcove, staring at the symbols carved into the ceiling. They pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat—or maybe his heartbeat pulsed in rhythm with them. Hard to tell anymore where his body ended and the magic began.

Tomorrow. Training started tomorrow. Then he'd learn to kill.

He rolled onto his side, pressing his marked palm against the cool stone wall. The burn had faded to a constant low warmth, like embers that never went out.

Footsteps approached his curtain. Marcus tensed.

"You awake?" Kira's voice, soft.

"Yeah."

She pushed through the beaded strings, carrying a small lantern that cast amber light across the chamber. "Thought you might be. First night's always the hardest."

Marcus sat up. "Does it get easier?"

"The nightmares? No." She set the lantern on the floor and sat cross-legged beside it. "But you learn to function through them."

"Great." He scrubbed his hands over his face. "That's encouraging."

"I'm not here to encourage you. I'm here to prepare you." Kira pulled something from her pocket—a small cloth bundle. She unwrapped it, revealing a chunk of what looked like crystal. It glowed faintly blue in the lantern light. "Hold out your hand. The marked one."

Marcus extended his palm. The scar pulsed brighter as the crystal came near.

Kira pressed it into his hand. "Don't drop it."

Cold shot through his arm. Not painful, but intense—like plunging his hand into ice water. The crystal's glow intensified, spreading up his veins in branching patterns of light.

"What is this?"

"Resonance stone. It amplifies your connection to the channels." Kira watched the light spread. "The Weavers will start your training with theory. Meditation. Breathing exercises. All important, but slow."

"And you're giving me a shortcut?"

"I'm giving you a head start." Her gold eyes met his. "Tomorrow they'll test you. Push magic through your channels to see how much you can handle. If you can't control even a trickle, they'll decide you're not worth training. Too much risk of immolation."

Marcus's fingers tightened around the crystal. "What happens to keys they don't train?"

"They serve in other ways. Maintenance. Veil repair grunt work. Missions that don't require magic." She paused. "Or they get sent home if the portal allowed it. Since yours doesn't... you'd be stuck here doing menial labor until the Veil breaks and everyone dies."

"No pressure then."

"Exactly." Kira pointed at the glowing veins in his arm. "You feel that?"

He did. The cold had spread to his shoulder, his chest, branching through his body along invisible pathways. Each branch tingled like pins and needles, but sharper. More alive.

"That's your channel network. Everyone's is different, shaped by their personality, their experiences, their resonance type." She traced a finger along one of the glowing lines. "Yours is... extensive. More branches than most."

"Is that good?"

"It means you have potential for high capacity. More channels means more magic can flow at once." Her expression darkened. "It also means more ways to burn yourself out if you lose control."

The glow pulsed, and Marcus gasped. Heat flared in his chest—not the constant warmth of his mark, but something sharper. Hotter. Like his blood had turned to liquid fire.

"Focus," Kira said. "Don't fight it. Let it flow."

"It hurts—"

"Pain is information. It tells you where the blockages are, where the flow is stuck." She pressed her hand over his heart. "Breathe. Slow. Match the pulse of the stone."

Marcus dragged in air. The crystal pulsed in his palm—slow, steady. He tried to match his breathing to it. One pulse. Inhale. Another. Exhale.

The fire in his veins didn't fade, but it changed. Became less like burning and more like... electricity. Energy crackling through his body, seeking an outlet.

"Good." Kira's hand stayed on his chest. "Now push it somewhere. Doesn't matter where. Palm, fingertips, anywhere. direct the flow and release."

Marcus focused on his free hand. The one not holding the crystal. He imagined the energy flowing down his arm, pooling in his palm, gathering—

Light exploded from his hand.

Not a lot. Maybe enough to match a weak flashlight. But it was there, crackling between his fingers like miniature lightning, casting wild shadows across the alcove walls.

"I'm doing it," he breathed.

"You are." Kira smiled. "First manifestation. Most keys take days to reach this point. You did it in minutes."

The light flickered. Marcus's concentration wavered.

"Don't lose it. Hold steady. Feel how the energy moves." Kira's voice stayed calm, grounding. "Magic isn't something you force. It's something you guide. Like water through a pipe. Too much pressure and the pipe bursts. Not enough and nothing flows."

Marcus focused. The light steadied, growing brighter. He could feel it now—the energy flowing from the crystal, through his channels, down his arm, out his palm. A circuit. A loop.

"How long can I hold this?"

"Depends on your stamina. Right now? Maybe a minute before you exhaust yourself." She leaned back. "Tomorrow it'll be thirty seconds. The day after, two minutes. You'll build endurance like a muscle."

The light wavered again. Marcus's hand started shaking.

"That's enough. Release it." Kira took the crystal from his other hand.

The light vanished. The glowing veins in his arm faded. Marcus slumped back against the wall, suddenly exhausted.

"One minute of magic and I feel like I ran a marathon."

"Your body isn't used to channeling yet. Give it time." Kira rewrapped the crystal. "Don't tell the Weavers I gave you this. They don't approve of shortcuts."

"Why help me then?"

She was quiet for a moment. "Because you remind me of someone. Another key. He asked the same questions you do. Looked for another way."

"What happened to him?"

"He found one." Kira stood, picking up the lantern. ". He learned to repair tangled threads instead of cutting them. Became a Mender like me. The Weavers weren't pleased, but he was too valuable to punish."

Hope sparked in Marcus's chest. "So it's possible. There are alternatives to killing."

"For some tangles, yes. For the one breaking the Veil?" She shook her head. "That corruption is too deep. It's had a thousand years to spread. Repair might not be an option."

"But it might be."

"Might be." Kira moved toward the curtain. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow's going to hurt."

She left. The beaded strings settled behind her.

Marcus lay back down, but sleep felt even further away now. His hand still tingled where the light had manifested. He flexed his fingers, half-expecting the glow to return.

Nothing happened.

But now it could. He'd channeled magic. Controlled it, if only for a minute. And if there was a Mender who'd found another way, who'd learned to repair instead of destroy...

Maybe Marcus could learn too.

He closed his eyes, finally drifting toward sleep.

The dream found him immediately.

He stood in the vision-void again, surrounded by threads of light. But this time he wasn't watching from outside. He was inside the Pattern, woven into it. His thread blazed gold, bright as a star.

Other threads wound around his. Silver threads. Crimson. Violet. Some familiar—Kira's gleamed like polished bronze. Others he didn't recognize.

And there, ahead in the darkness, a thread that looked wrong. Black instead of colored. Pulsing with sick energy. Where it touched other threads, they frayed. Weakened. Snapped.

The tangle.

Marcus tried to move toward it, but his own thread held him back. Not ready yet. Not trained. Approach too soon and it would corrupt him too. Snap his thread like all the others.

He woke gasping.

Dawn light—or what passed for it in this world—filtered through his curtain. The symbols on the ceiling had stopped pulsing. carvings now. Inert.

Marcus sat up, heart pounding. The dream felt like more than a dream. Like a warning. A preview.

He was going to face that thing. That black thread unraveling reality.

And when he did, he needed to be ready.

* * *

The training hall was deep beneath the main chamber. Marcus followed Kira and a dozen other keys down spiral stairs carved into living rock, lit by more of those floating light sources.

The red-haired boy from yesterday walked ahead of them. Up close, Marcus could see his binding mark curved across his left cheek like a crescent moon. He caught Marcus staring and smirked.

"First day?" His accent was thick—Russian, maybe.

"That obvious?"

"You look terrified. Everyone does on day one." He extended a hand. "Dmitri."

"Marcus."

They shook. Dmitri's grip was firm, his palm calloused. Not from manual labor—from something else.

"You're the one who talked back to the Elders yesterday." Dmitri grinned. "That took balls. Or stupidity. Possibly both."

"Definitely both," Marcus muttered.

The stairs opened into a vast circular chamber. The floor was marked with concentric circles in white chalk. At the center stood a Weaver—tall, cloaked, faceless as always. But this one's hands glowed with pale blue fire.

The keys arranged themselves around the outer circle. Marcus found a spot between Dmitri and the water girl from yesterday. She was younger than he'd thought. Maybe thirteen, with dark hair and nervous eyes.

The Weaver's voice filled all their heads at once:

*You are here because you have resonance. Potential. But potential without control is worthless. Worse than worthless—it is dangerous.*

Blue fire gathered in its hands, condensing into a sphere.

*Magic is not power. It is precision. Flow, not force. Today you will learn the first lesson: to feel your channels without destroying them.*

The sphere split into dozens of smaller . They floated out to each key, hovering at chest height.

*Touch the light. Let it flow through you. Guide it, do not fight it. Those who resist will burn. Those who surrender will drown. You must find balance.*

Marcus stared at the orb in front of him. It looked identical to the one Kira's crystal had created in his hand. Same pale blue. Same gentle pulse.

Around the circle, keys reached out. Some gasped. Others went rigid. The boy two spots down from Marcus screamed and collapsed, smoke rising from his palm.

The Weaver gestured. The boy's orb vanished. Two other keys dragged him toward the stairs. His hand was blistered, already swelling.

*First failure. There will be more. Begin.*

Marcus reached for his orb.

Cold flooded him—colder than Kira's crystal, sharper. It shot through his channels like ice water through pipes. He gasped but held on, remembering her words. Don't fight it. Guide it.

He breathed. Matched the pulse. Let the energy flow.

The orb's light spread to his palm, then up his arm. Not burning. Not drowning. Flowing.

*Good. Now direct it. Choose a path and push the energy through.*

Marcus focused. He imagined the flow moving down instead of up. Toward his feet. Through his legs. Into the ground.

The light followed his intention, branching through his lower channels. It felt... right. Natural. Like water finding its level.

He opened his eyes. Around the circle, half the keys were gone. Collapsed or fled or dragged away. Those who remained had light flowing through them—some bright, some dim, but all controlled.

The Weaver moved through the circle, observing each key. When it reached Marcus, it stopped. Tilted its head.

*Interesting. Your channels are already partially awakened.*

Marcus's heart sank. Kira had warned him not to mention the crystal.

*This is good,* the Weaver continued. *You may progress faster than others. But be cautious. Early awakening often leads to overconfidence. And overconfidence leads to immolation.*

It moved on.

Marcus exhaled slowly, keeping the flow steady. Beside him, Dmitri grinned through gritted teeth, his whole body outlined in crackling energy. The water girl had gentle blue light flowing through her, calm as a stream.

*You have survived the first trial. Tomorrow you will learn to shape the flow. To create with it. Or destroy.* The Weaver gestured and all the  vanished. The keys who'd been channeling slumped, exhausted. *Rest. Recover. Training continues at dawn.*

The Weaver glided from the chamber.

Marcus's legs gave out. He sat hard on the stone floor, every muscle aching.

"Not bad." Dmitri dropped beside him, breathing hard. "Most people don't make it through day one conscious."

"How long have you been training?" Marcus asked.

"Six months. Still can't throw lightning without singeing myself." He flexed his scarred hands. "But I'm getting better."

The water girl sat on Marcus's other side. Up close, he could see tears on her cheeks.

"You okay?" Marcus asked.

She nodded, but the tears kept falling. "It's ... I've never been able to do it before. The magic. The Binding worked but nothing came out." She looked at her hands, where faint blue light still flickered. "Today it finally worked."

"What's your name?" Marcus asked gently.

"Lily. From Oregon." She wiped her eyes. "I've been here two months. This is the first time I've channeled anything."

Dmitri clapped her on the shoulder. "Congratulations, malen'kaya. You're finally a real key."

They sat together as the other successful keys filtered out. Eight had made it through. Twelve hadn't.

"What happens to them?" Marcus asked. "The ones who fail?"

"Medical wing for burns. Then reassignment." Dmitri stood, offering Marcus a hand up. "Come on. Food and rest. Tomorrow's lesson is worse."

Marcus let him pull him up. His whole body felt hollow, like all his energy had drained out through his feet into the stone.

But he'd done it. Channeled magic on his first day without burning himself.

It was a start.

A small start toward finding another way.

- **Threads advanced**: How will Marcus learn magic (first successful channeling), Who are the other keys (met Dmitri and Lily), Can Marcus find alternative to killing (learned about Mender who repairs tangles), What is the tangle (saw it in dream as black corrupting thread)
- **Threads opened**: Will Marcus build a team/allies among the keys?, Can the specific Veil-breaking tangle be repaired or only killed?, What happened to the Mender who learned to repair?, How long until Marcus is sent on his mission?
