# Chapter 6

Marcus spent the next week split between two teachers.

Days belonged to the Weavers. Combat training intensified—not blades or fire anymore, but precision. Targeting. Control under pressure. The training chamber filled with moving targets, illusions that fought back, scenarios designed to force split-second decisions.

Eight keys became seven when the boy who generated air barriers pushed too hard and collapsed his own lungs. Kira saved him, but he was reassigned. Maintenance work. No more training.

Seven became six when the tall whirlwind girl tried to manifest wings and fell thirty feet onto stone.

Six remained. Marcus, Dmitri, Lily, an older woman named Sarai who specialized in barriers, a quiet Asian boy called Jin who could phase through solid matter, and a muscular guy from Brazil named Paulo who controlled earth and stone.

They trained until their bodies gave out. Rested long enough to recover. Trained again.

Nights belonged to Evan.

The Mender wing became Marcus's second home. After the other keys slept, he'd slip down the hall to Evan's study and learn what the Weavers would never teach.

"The Pattern isn't static," Evan explained on the third night, sketching thread diagrams by lamplight. "It's alive. Breathing. Every choice creates ripples. Every death sends shockwaves. You have to feel those movements. Understand the rhythm before you can intervene."

He handed Marcus a small crystal—not like Kira's resonance stone, but something smoother. Darker.

"Pattern fragment. Taken from a healed tangle." Evan's voice was soft. "Hold it. Let it show you."

Marcus closed his fingers around the crystal.

Vision slammed into him.

threads. Hundreds of them, woven tight. But these threads weren't healthy gold and silver and crimson. They were sickly. Twisted. A dark infection spreading through the weave like cancer through tissue.

And there—at the center—a single point where the corruption started. A wound. A tear in the Pattern itself, leaking poison into everything it touched.

Someone had tried to force two incompatible threads together. Bind them when they should have stayed separate. The fusion point festered, spreading darkness outward.

But then—light. Gentle green light flowing through the infected area. Not attacking the corruption. Not cutting it away. Nurturing the healthy threads around it. Strengthening them. Giving them enough resilience to resist the spread.

Slowly, carefully, the light worker isolated the fusion point. Separated the forced connection. Smoothed the torn edges. Let the threads spring apart into their natural configurations.

The corruption faded. Not completely—the damage was too deep for full healing. But it stopped spreading. Stopped actively destroying. Became dormant scar tissue instead of active infection.

The vision released him.

Marcus gasped, falling back against the wall. "That was you. You healed that."

"Five years ago. Small tangle. Maybe two dozen threads affected." Evan took back the crystal. "It took me three days and nearly killed me twice. But the host survived. Lives in the Sanctum now. Works in the gardens."

"The Weavers didn't stop you?"

"They were skeptical. Still are. But when I succeeded, they couldn't deny the results." He set the crystal carefully in a case lined with soft cloth. "Mending works for small tangles. Personal corruptions. Localized infections. But the Veil tangle..." He shook his head. "That's spread across two entire reality sections. Thousands of threads. Maybe millions. I don't know if my technique scales."

"But it might."

"It might." Evan met his eyes. "That's why I'm teaching you. You're younger. Stronger. Your channels are more flexible than mine ever were. If anyone can push the technique to that scale, it's you."

"No pressure," Marcus said dryly.

Evan smiled. "Exactly as much pressure as necessary."

They worked through the night. Evan teaching pattern reading, thread manipulation, the delicate art of separating corrupted tissue from healthy. Marcus absorbing it all, practicing on pattern fragments, learning to see the difference between fusion damage and natural connection.

"The key," Evan said as false dawn approached, "is finding the wound. The original point of corruption. Everything else is symptom. Address the wound, seal it properly, and the symptoms can heal on their own."

"And if I can't find the wound?"

"Then you do what the Weavers say. Cut the thread. Kill the host." Evan's voice was heavy. "But at least you'll have tried."

Marcus left the Mender wing as sunrise light filtered through the Sanctum. His head ached from the intense study. His channels felt raw from practicing pattern manipulation.

But he had hope. Real, concrete hope. Not certainty—Evan had been clear about that. But a path forward that didn't require becoming a murderer.

He had to master it before the Weavers sent him through the Veil.

"You look like death," Dmitri observed at breakfast.

"Thanks." Marcus grabbed bread and something that resembled cheese. "Didn't sleep much."

"Nightmares?"

"Something like that."

Lily sat down beside them, moving carefully. Yesterday's training had been particularly brutal—extended combat scenarios where they had to defend themselves against illusions of shadow creatures. She'd taken several hits before managing to drown her opponents.

"Two more days," she said quietly. "Then evaluation."

Marcus looked up. "What?"

"You didn't hear? The Weaver announced it this morning." She pushed food around her plate. "Final evaluation in two days. They'll determine if we're ready for field deployment."

"Field deployment." Paulo joined them, his accent thick. "Such nice words for 'killing missions.'"

"Controlled elimination of corruption nodes," Jin said in his soft voice. "That's what they called it when they briefed me."

Sarai, the oldest of their group at maybe twenty-five, set down her cup. "They're sending us out. All of us. Whether we're ready or not."

"The Veil situation must be deteriorating faster than they expected," Dmitri said. "They need keys in the field now, not months from now."

Marcus's stomach turned to ice. Two days. He had two days to master techniques Evan had spent years developing. Two days before they sent him to kill someone.

"I'm not ready," Lily whispered.

"None of us are." Sarai's voice was firm. "But ready or not, we'll do what we must. The alternative is worse."

They ate in silence after that.

Marcus could barely taste the food. Two days. The timeline had collapsed. All his careful study with Evan, all the pattern manipulation practice—he'd barely scratched the surface.

Could he even attempt the surgical approach in two days? Or would he have to default to the Weavers' method after all?

After breakfast, he went straight to the Mender wing.

Evan was treating a key who'd burned herself practicing fire manipulation. He looked up as Marcus entered, read his expression, and dismissed the patient.

"They announced the evaluation."

"I know." Evan closed the door. "One of the Elders informed me this morning. Asked me to ensure all keys are in optimal physical condition for deployment."

"Two days," Marcus said. "I'd have weeks. Months, even."

"The Veil is breaking faster than predicted. The Weavers are scrambling." Evan pulled out his diagrams. "So we accelerate. I was going to ease you into this, but there's no time. You need to learn pattern diagnosis in the field. Right now."

"How?"

"By practicing on a live subject."

Marcus's pulse jumped. "Someone's corrupted?"

"No. But someone has old damage. Healed but scarred. You're going to examine the scar tissue, trace it back to the wound, understand how the corruption spread and how it was stopped." Evan moved to the door. "Follow me."

They went to the gardens—a section of the Sanctum Marcus hadn't visited before. It opened above ground, letting real sunlight (or this world's equivalent) stream through crystal panels. Plants grew in neat rows, tended by a handful of people in simple tunics.

One of them looked up as they approached. A woman, maybe forty, with kind eyes and silver hair. Her binding mark wrapped around her entire left arm in spiral patterns.

"Evan." She smiled. "And the new student. Marcus, yes?"

"This is Aria," Evan said. "The tangle I showed you in the vision—she was the host."

Marcus stared. This calm, gentle woman had been infected with pattern corruption? Had nearly been killed by it?

"Come." Aria set down her gardening tools. "You need to see what Evan saved me from."

She led them to a quiet corner of the garden, sat on a stone bench, and extended her marked arm. "I give you permission to read my pattern. To see the damage and the healing both."

Marcus looked at Evan, who nodded encouragement.

"Channel gently. Don't force. Let the pattern show you what it wants you to see."

Marcus took Aria's hand. Closed his eyes. Drew power through his channels and extended his awareness outward, following Evan's teachings.

The threads appeared. Aria's pattern, woven tight. Most of it healthy—gold and silver and warm bronze. But there, along her left side, scar tissue. Dark patches where threads had fused wrong, been forced apart, fused again in healthier configurations.

Marcus traced the damage back. Back through time, through choices, through moments of connection and separation.

There. The wound. Five years ago. Aria had tried to save her daughter from drowning. Had pulled the girl from water, breathed life back into her lungs. But the daughter was already gone. The thread already cut.

Aria couldn't accept it. Wouldn't let go. She'd used magic—wild, untrained magic—to try binding her daughter's thread back into the pattern. To force resurrection.

It hadn't worked. The dead thread rotted. Spread corruption into Aria's own pattern. Nearly killed her.

Until Evan came. Found the fusion point. Gently separated Aria's thread from her daughter's corpse. Sealed the wound. Let Aria grieve instead of dying with her.

Marcus released the vision, blinking back tears.

"I'm sorry," he whispered.

"Don't be." Aria's voice was steady. "I learned. I survived. And now I help things grow instead of trying to resurrect what's dead." She touched the scar on her arm. "This reminds me. Life moves forward. Trying to drag it backward only creates monsters."

Marcus looked at Evan. "The tangle breaking the Veil—it's like this, isn't it? Someone tried to force something that shouldn't be forced."

"We think so. But on a much larger scale. And the forcing happened a thousand years ago. We don't know who. We don't know exactly what they tried to bind. But the wound never healed. It kept festering." Evan's expression was grim. "Your job is to find that wound. That original fusion point. And either heal it or cut it. Preferably the former."

"In two days."

"In two days." Evan gripped his shoulder. "I know it's not enough time. But it's what we have."

Marcus looked at Aria's scars. At the evidence that healing was possible. That corruption could be stopped without killing the host.

He had a direction. A technique. A chance.

Now he needed to survive long enough to use it.
