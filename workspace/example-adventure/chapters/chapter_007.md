# Chapter 7

The evaluation chamber was different from the training halls.

Colder. Darker. The walls were black stone instead of gray, carved with symbols that pulsed red instead of blue. Five Weaver Elders stood in a semicircle at the center, their cloaks merging into the shadows until only their pale hands showed.

The six remaining keys stood opposite them.

Marcus's marked palm throbbed in rhythm with the red symbols. Beside him, Lily's hands shook. Even Dmitri looked tense, his usual confidence replaced by grim determination.

*You have trained for two weeks,* the center Elder's voice filled their minds. *You have learned to channel. To shape. To destroy. Now you will demonstrate whether that knowledge is sufficient.*

One of the Elders raised a hand. The floor in front of the keys shimmered and split, revealing darkness below. From that darkness, something climbed out.

Not an illusion this time.

A creature of shadow and malice, vaguely humanoid but wrong in every detail. Too many joints. Limbs that bent backward. Eyes that glowed sickly green.

*Corrupted host,* the Elder explained. *Retrieved from a minor tangle site yesterday. The human inside is already dead. What remains is animated infection. Your task: eliminate it. Prove you can destroy corruption when necessary.*

The creature hissed. Lunged.

Sarai threw up a barrier. The creature slammed into it, claws screeching against solid air. Paulo thrust his hands down—stone spikes erupted from the floor, impaling the thing's legs.

It didn't slow. Didn't feel pain. kept pushing against the barrier, corruption oozing from its wounds like black blood.

Marcus channeled. Light gathered in his palm—his default manifestation, the one that came easiest. But light wouldn't kill this thing.

He shifted the energy. Made it sharper. Denser. Formed it into a blade like the Weaver had demonstrated weeks ago.

The golden light crystallized into a cutting edge.

Jin phased through the barrier, appeared behind the creature, solidified long enough to drive a dagger of hardened air through its spine.

The creature whirled with impossible speed. Caught Jin's arm. The corruption spread from its touch, black veins racing up Jin's skin.

"Jin!" Lily screamed.

Water burst from her hands—not gentle sphere-practice but a high-pressure jet. It blasted the creature away from Jin, slamming it against the far wall.

Dmitri's lightning followed. Electricity arced across the chamber, striking the creature dead center. It convulsed, shrieking in a voice that wasn't human.

Marcus moved without thinking. Rushed forward while it was stunned. Brought his light-blade down across its neck.

The blade cut clean. The creature's head fell. Black corruption sprayed across stone, then began evaporating, leaving nothing behind.

The body collapsed. Dissolved into smoke.

Silence.

Marcus stared at his hands. At the blade still manifested there. He'd killed something. True, it was already dead. Already lost. But still—he'd made the killing blow.

It had been easy.

Terrifyingly easy.

*Adequate,* the center Elder said. *The corruption is destroyed. But Jin is compromised.*

They all turned to Jin. The black veins had spread to his shoulder, creeping toward his heart. He clutched his arm, face pale, breathing ragged.

"Help him!" Lily pleaded.

*This is part of the evaluation,* another Elder said. *Can you cleanse corruption from a living host? Or must he be eliminated before the infection spreads further?*

Marcus's stomach dropped. They wanted the keys to either heal Jin or kill him. As a test.

"There has to be another way," he said.

*Then demonstrate it.*

Marcus looked at his friends. Dmitri had lightning—useless for healing. Paulo controlled earth—equally useless. Lily had water, which might help, but she was shaking too hard to focus. Sarai's barriers couldn't touch internal corruption.

That left Marcus.

He'd spent two weeks learning pattern reading from Evan. Learning to trace corruption back to its source. But he'd never tried to heal actively. Never attempted to cleanse infection from a living person.

If he failed, Jin would die. Or worse—become corrupted completely, turned into something like the creature they'd destroyed.

But if he didn't try...

Marcus moved to Jin's side. "I need you to trust me."

Jin's eyes were wide with fear, but he nodded.

Marcus placed his hand over the corrupted area. Closed his eyes. Extended his awareness into Jin's pattern.

The threads appeared. Jin's life woven in silver and pale blue—threads of caution, precision, discipline. But there, spreading through them, black corruption. Infection that burned where it touched healthy tissue. It had already consumed maybe thirty threads. Was actively spreading to more.

Marcus traced it back. Found the entry point where the creature had touched Jin. The wound was still fresh, still bleeding corruption into the surrounding pattern.

He needed to seal it. Close the wound. Stop the spread.

But how?

Evan's lessons flooded back. Don't attack corruption directly. Strengthen the healthy tissue around it. Give it the resilience to resist.

Marcus channeled. Not his combat manifestation. Not blades or lightning. Healing energy. The same green light he'd seen in Evan's pattern vision.

He pushed it into the healthy threads surrounding the infection. Reinforced them. Made them stronger. Gave them structure to push back against the corruption.

Slowly, the black veins stopped spreading.

The healthy threads formed a barrier. A containment wall around the infected area. The corruption couldn't advance past it.

Now for the hard part.

Marcus focused on the wound itself. The entry point. He couldn't seal it—that would trap the corruption inside. He needed to drain it first. Pull the infection out.

He shaped his energy into a gentle suction. Not forceful—that would tear the threads. Gentle. Patient. Like drawing poison from a wound with a poultice.

The corruption resisted. It wanted to spread. To consume. To destroy.

But Marcus held firm. Kept the healthy barrier strong while slowly, carefully extracting the infection.

Black vapor rose from Jin's arm. Wisps of corruption pulled free from his pattern, evaporating in the air.

More. Keep going. Almost there.

Sweat poured down Marcus's face. His channels burned from the effort. But he couldn't stop now. If he released too soon, the corruption would surge back, stronger than before.

Finally—the last of it. The wound was clean. Marcus sealed it shut, reinforcing Jin's threads where they'd been torn. Not perfect healing. Jin would carry a scar. But the corruption was gone.

Marcus released his channeling and collapsed.

Hands caught him. Dmitri on one side, Lily on the other.

"Did it work?" Marcus gasped.

Jin flexed his arm. The black veins were gone. Only faint silver scars remained where they'd been. He stared at his hand in wonder.

"It worked," he breathed. "You healed me."

*Interesting.* The center Elder moved closer. *You employed Mender techniques. Not standard key training.*

Marcus's heart sank. They knew. Of course they knew.

"I studied with Evan," he admitted. "I wanted to learn alternatives. In case—in case killing isn't necessary."

*The Pattern does not reward sentiment. It rewards results.* The Elder's telepathic voice was cold. *However. In this instance, your result was superior. Jin remains functional. A killing approach would have left us one key fewer.*

The Elder turned to address all of them.

*You have each demonstrated competency. Combat effectiveness. The ability to destroy corruption when needed. And—in Marcus's case—the ability to preserve assets when possible.* It gestured, and the floor sealed shut. The chamber's red symbols faded to dormant black. *You are approved for field deployment. Rest today. Tomorrow, you receive your first assignments.*

The Elders glided from the chamber, leaving the six keys alone.

For a moment, no one spoke.

Then Lily broke down. Sank to her knees, sobbing with relief. Sarai knelt beside her, offering quiet comfort.

Paulo punched the air. "We passed. We passed."

"Marcus saved my life," Jin said quietly. He looked at his healed arm, then at Marcus. "Thank you. I thought... they were going to make you kill me."

"They might have," Dmitri said grimly. "If Marcus hadn't pulled off that healing."

Marcus leaned against the wall, exhausted. He'd done it. Healed active corruption in front of the Elders. Proved the technique worked.

But now they were approved for deployment. Tomorrow they'd get their first real missions. Assignments to find and eliminate corruption nodes across the Veil.

And Marcus's would almost certainly be the big one. The tangle breaking the Veil itself.

of Aria's story. Of someone trying to resurrect the dead, to bind what shouldn't be bound. What had happened a thousand years ago? Who had tried to force that connection? And why was it still spreading after all this time?

Tomorrow, he might find out.

If he survived long enough.

* * *

That night, Marcus returned to Evan's study.

The Mender was waiting for him, diagrams spread across every surface.

"You healed Jin in front of the Elders." Evan's voice held a mixture of pride and concern. "Word travels fast in the Sanctum."

"They know I studied with you."

"I expected as much. The question is whether they'll punish you for it or utilize your expanded skillset." Evan gestured to the diagrams. "Given that you're not in a punishment cell right now, I'm guessing the latter."

"They approved me for deployment. Tomorrow I get my first assignment."

"The Veil tangle."

It wasn't a question.

Marcus nodded.

Evan sighed. Pulled out a final diagram—larger than the others, more complex. "Then you need to see this. My theory about what happened a thousand years ago. What created the original wound."

The diagram showed two massive sections of the Pattern. Separate reality branches, each stable on their own. Between them, a thin connection. A bridge.

And on that bridge, a figure. Human-shaped but blazing with power. They held two threads—one from each reality section—and were forcing them together. Trying to create a permanent fusion.

"Someone tried to merge the realities," Marcus breathed.

"Or merge two people from different realities. Create a permanent bond across the Veil." Evan tapped the diagram. "It could have been love. Desperation. A parent trying to save their child. A lover refusing to accept separation. We don't know the motive. But we know the result."

He showed the next stage. The forced fusion creating a wound. Corruption spreading from the connection point. The two reality sections recoiling, but unable to fully separate because the forced thread held them together.

"The Veil was the emergency solution. Seal off the corruption. Keep the two sections apart. But the thread was never cut. The fusion never undone. So for a thousand years, the wound has festered. The corruption has spread through that bridge, eating away at the Veil from the inside."

"And now the Veil is failing."

"Now the Veil is failing." Evan met his eyes. "Your job is to go to that bridge. Find the fusion point. And either heal it—separate the forced threads and seal the wound properly—or cut it. Sever the connection completely."

"Which would kill whoever was bound."

"If they're even still alive after a thousand years. The corruption might have consumed them long ago. You might be cutting a corpse-thread, like I did with Aria's daughter."

Or Marcus might be killing someone who'd been suffering for a millennium, trapped in a forced connection they never asked for.

Or two someones. One from each reality.

"How do I find the bridge?" Marcus asked.

"The Weavers will open a portal for you. Direct path through the weakest part of the Veil. You'll emerge in the between-space where the two realities meet." Evan rolled up his diagrams. "After that, you follow the corruption back to its source. Same technique I showed you with Aria, but on a much larger scale."

"And if I can't heal it?"

"Then you cut. Fast and clean. Don't hesitate." Evan's voice was hard. "Hesitation in the presence of that much corruption will get you killed. Or worse—infected. And if you become corrupted, the Weavers will send someone else to eliminate you and the tangle both."

No pressure. the fate of two realities and his own life hanging in the balance.

"When do I leave?" Marcus asked.

"Tomorrow evening. After they brief all six of you on your assignments." Evan gripped his shoulder. "Get some sleep. Eat well. Center yourself. Because once you cross the Veil, you're on your own. I can't help you there."

Marcus left the Mender wing feeling the weight of everything pressing down on him. Tomorrow. He had one day. One day to prepare for a mission that would either save millions or doom them all.

He passed through the main hall. Most keys were asleep, but Lily sat by one of the food tables, picking at bread.

"Couldn't sleep either?" Marcus asked.

She shook her head. "Keep thinking about that creature. How easily it could have been Jin. Could have been any of us."

"But it wasn't."

"This time." She looked at him. "Tomorrow we get real missions. Real tangles. What if I freeze up? What if I can't do it when it matters?"

"You drowned your target today. Saved Jin from the creature. You didn't freeze then."

"That was training. There were Elders watching. Dmitri and everyone else backing me up." Her voice dropped. "What if I'm alone? What if it's me and some poor infected person and I have to choose between killing them or letting the corruption spread?"

Marcus sat beside her. "Then you'll make the choice that saves the most lives. That's all any of us can do."

"Is that what you'll do? On your mission?"

He hesitated. Lily was smart. the Weavers would send him after the biggest tangle. Everyone knew.

"I'm going to try to heal instead of kill. Find the source and remove it without murdering the host." Marcus met her eyes. "But if I can't... if healing isn't possible... then yeah. I'll make the choice that saves the most lives."

"Even if it means becoming a killer."

"Even then."

They sat in silence for a while.

"I hope you find a better way," Lily said finally. "Not for the person you're trying to save. For you. So you don't have to carry that weight."

"Thanks." Marcus stood. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow comes whether we're ready or not."

He left her there and returned to his alcove.

Sleep didn't come. But he lay there anyway, staring at the pulsing symbols on the ceiling, counting down the hours until his first—and possibly last—mission.
