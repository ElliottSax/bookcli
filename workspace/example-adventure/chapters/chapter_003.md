# Chapter 3

Marcus's legs wobbled on the third step.

Kira caught his elbow before he could pitch forward. "Easy. You've been horizontal for three days. Your muscles forgot how to work."

"They remember fine." He pulled free. Took another step. His thigh trembled but held. "See?"

"Stubborn." She shook her head, beads clicking. "That'll either save you or kill you."

"The Weaver already told me both options are fine with them."

"The Weavers." Kira's correction was gentle. "There are hundreds. The one you met was probably an Elder. They're the only ones who bother talking to humans."

Hundreds. Marcus filed that away with all the other terrifying information he'd collected in the past few hours. He took another step, then another. The stone floor was cold against his bare feet. Someone—Kira, probably—had dressed him in loose gray pants and a tunic that felt like linen. His own clothes, his backpack, his phone—all gone. Left behind in Vermont with everything else he'd lost.

Don't think about that. Focus on walking.

The beaded curtain swayed ahead of them. Beyond it, light spilled from what sounded like a larger space. Voices echoed, low. Murmuring. Not the telepathic intrusion of the Weavers, but actual human speech.

Marcus pushed through the curtain.

The chamber outside was enormous. Vaulted ceiling disappeared into shadows above glowing  that floated without visible support. Dozens of alcoves lined the circular walls, each one curtained like the room he'd occupied. The floor was smooth stone inlaid with silver lines that formed a pattern too complex for his eyes to follow. They pulsed with faint light, like veins carrying luminescent blood.

People moved through the space. Not many—maybe twenty—but after three days alone with only Kira and one terrifying Weaver, it felt like a crowd. They wore the same gray tunics. Pants marcus did. Some sat in small groups, talking quietly. Others practiced what had to be magic: a girl making water sphere in her hands, a boy whose fingers sparked with electricity, someone hovering three inches off the ground with their eyes closed in concentration.

All of them had marks. He could see the scars glowing faintly on exposed skin—palms, wrists, collarbones, even one on a woman's temple.

"Welcome to the Sanctum," Kira said. "Main hall. This is where we live when we're not..." She gestured vaguely. "Working."

"Working on what?"

"Depends. Training, mostly. Learning control. Some people go on missions for the Weavers. Reconnaissance, artifact retrieval, Veil repairs."

"Veil repairs." Marcus latched onto that. "So it can be fixed."

"Temporarily. We're patching holes in a dam that's crumbling from the foundation up. The real problem is deeper." Kira guided him toward a long table where food was laid out—bread, something that looked like cheese, bowls of what might be fruit though the colors were wrong. "Eat. You need to rebuild strength."

Marcus's stomach growled. He couldn't remember his last meal. Three days unconscious meant three days without food. He grabbed bread and tore into it. The taste was strange, sweet with an herbal aftertaste, but his body didn't care. He devoured two pieces before his brain caught up.

"Who are all these people?" he asked around a mouthful.

"Keys. Like you." Kira poured water from a pitcher into two cups. "Everyone here has resonance. Most came voluntarily once the pull. Some were... recruited more aggressively."

"Kidnapped, you mean."

"The Weavers don't see a distinction. You have resonance, you belong here. Your permission is irrelevant to the pattern."

There was that word again. Pattern. Marcus swallowed bread that had turned to paste in his mouth. "What is the pattern? Everyone keeps saying it like I should know."

Kira's gold eyes flicked to something over his shoulder. "Maybe you should ask them directly."

Marcus turned.

Three Weavers stood at the far end of the hall. Tall, cloaked, faceless. They didn't move, but every person in the chamber had gone still. The girl's water sphere collapsed into her lap. The hovering boy dropped to the ground with a thud.

Silence crashed over the space like a wave.

One Weaver raised a pale hand and pointed at Marcus.

*Come.*

The word wasn't sound. It pressed directly into his skull, bypassing his ears entirely.

Marcus's legs moved before he could decide to obey. Three steps forward, then he planted his feet and stopped. No. He'd been dragged here, bound, marked, given ultimatums by creatures that saw his death as an acceptable outcome. He wasn't going to shuffle obediently to whatever came next.

"Why?" His voice echoed in the silent hall. "What do you want?"

The other people—keys, Kira called them—stared at him like he'd grown a second head. Apparently talking back to Weavers wasn't standard protocol.

The center Weaver tilted its head. The motion was too smooth, too fluid. Wrong.

*You wish to understand the pattern before you serve it?*

"Yeah. I do." Marcus's heart hammered. The mark on his palm burned. "You pulled me from my world, bound magic into my body I don't know how to use, told me I have to stop a war I didn't start. I think I've earned some answers."

The Weavers didn't respond immediately. Marcus could feel them looking at him, even though they had no eyes. The weight of their regard pressed against his skin like physical force.

Finally, the center one spoke again:

*well. You will be shown.*

It glided forward. The crowd parted like water before it. Marcus held his ground even though every instinct screamed at him to run.

The Weaver stopped an arm's length away. Cold radiated from it, the same fundamental wrongness he'd felt before. Up close, he could see that its cloak wasn't fabric—it moved like smoke, constantly shifting, twilight made tangible.

It extended one hand.

*Take it. See what we serve.*

Marcus looked at the pale hand with its too-many fingers. Looked back at the Weaver's absent face. Every fiber of his being said this was a terrible idea.

He took the hand.

Reality shattered.

The Sanctum vanished. Marcus stood in a vast void, dark as the space between galaxies. But it wasn't empty. Light moved through the darkness—threads of it, thousands upon thousands, weaving in and out of existence. Each thread was a different color: gold, silver, crimson, emerald, violet. They braided together, separated, reconnected in patterns so complex they hurt to perceive.

"What is this?" His voice had no sound here, but the Weaver understood.

*The pattern. The weave of reality itself. Every thread is a life, a choice, a moment. We do not control it. We maintain it. Guide it where necessary. Prevent it from tangling into collapse.*

Marcus watched the threads move. Some were thick and bright. Others were thin, barely visible. As he watched, a silver thread snapped. The threads around it recoiled, and for a moment the pattern warped, pulling tight.

*Damage,* the Weaver said. *Small. But accumulating. The Veil was woven to separate two sections of the pattern that had become tangled. War was the tangle. Separation was the repair.*

"Then why is it breaking?"

*Time. Pressure. The two sections push against each other still, seeking to reconnect. The Veil was meant to be temporary—a thousand years to allow healing. But the tangle's source was never addressed. Now the Veil weakens, and the tangle threatens to return.*

A thread blazed bright in the darkness—gold, brilliant, burning like a star. It moved through the pattern toward a section where the darkness seemed deeper, more absolute.

*You,* the Weaver said. *Your thread. Your purpose.*

Marcus stared at his own life reduced to a line of golden light. "What am I supposed to do?"

*Find the tangle's source. Repair what was broken. Or cut the thread before it tears the pattern apart.*

"Cut the thread. You mean—"

*Kill what causes the tangle. Yes.*

The void vanished. Marcus stumbled back into the Sanctum, gasping. His hand was still wrapped around the Weaver's, and he jerked it free like he'd touched a live wire.

The Weaver regarded him silently.

"You want me to kill someone." Marcus's voice shook. "That's what this is about. You need a murderer."

*We need a key. A bridge between worlds. You can go where we cannot. Find what we cannot perceive.* The Weaver's telepathic voice remained flat, emotionless. *The tangle hides in human form. Human perception is required to identify it.*

"And if I refuse?"

*The pattern adapts. Another key will be found. But the Veil will break before they can be prepared. Millions will die when the war returns. Perhaps billions.* The Weaver paused. *Your choice changes nothing. Only the timeline.*

Marcus's stomach twisted. "That's not a choice."

*All actions are choices. The pattern simply recognizes which threads lead where.*

The three Weavers turned as one and glided toward an archway Marcus hadn't noticed before. At the threshold, the center one looked back.

*Training begins tomorrow. You will learn to channel magic without destroying yourself. After that, you will cross the Veil and hunt the tangle.* A pause, weightier than before. *Do not disappoint the pattern, Marcus Chen. It has so few threads capable of what must be done.*

They vanished through the archway, leaving silence in their wake.

Marcus stood frozen, his marked palm burning, his mind reeling. Hunt the tangle. Find a human infected with—what? Corruption? Evil? Kill them before the Veil broke.

A fifteen-year-old boy assassin. That's what they wanted.

"Hey." Kira's hand on his shoulder made him flinch. "You okay?"

Marcus laughed. The sound came out harsh. "No. Definitely not okay."

"What did they show you?"

"The pattern. My thread. What they want me to do." He turned to face her. "Did you know? That they'd ask me to kill someone?"

Kira's expression didn't change, but something shifted behind her gold eyes. "I suspected. It's what keys are for. We cross boundaries, do things the Weavers can't. Sometimes that means killing."

"Have you—" He couldn't finish the question.

"Twice," she said quietly. "Both times the targets were already twisted beyond saving. Corruption spreads, Marcus. Sometimes you cut out the rot or the whole body dies."

The food in his stomach wanted to come back up. Marcus swallowed hard against the urge. "I don't know how to kill someone."

"You'll learn. The Weavers are thorough teachers." Kira guided him back toward the table. "Sit. Breathe. You don't have to process this all at once."

But he did. Tomorrow training started. Then he'd be sent through the Veil—somehow—to find and murder someone who might not even know they were infected with whatever was destroying reality.

The other keys had resumed their activities, but Marcus caught them watching him sideways. A boy about his age with red hair and a mark on his cheek. An older woman whose hands glowed faintly even at rest. The girl with the water magic, now staring at him openly.

They all knew. This was what they did. What they'd been trained for.

What he was now.

Marcus sank onto a bench and put his head in his hands. The mark on his palm pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat.

"I want to go home," he whispered.

"I know." Kira sat beside him. "Everyone here has wanted that. Some still do."

"Does it get easier?"

She didn't answer right away. When she did, her voice was soft. "No. But you get stronger. Strong enough to bear it."

Marcus looked up at the glowing  floating above them, at the keys practicing magic that should be impossible, at the archway where the Weavers had vanished.

Strong enough to bear it. Strong enough to kill.

He clenched his fist, feeling the scar burn against his palm.

Tomorrow, training. After that, murder.

Unless he found another way.

There had to be another way.
