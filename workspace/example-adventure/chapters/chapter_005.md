# Chapter 5

The training chamber smelled like ozone and burnt flesh.

Marcus tried not to look at the scorch marks on the walls. Or the stains on the floor that might have been blood. Might have been worse.

"Shaping lesson," Dmitri muttered beside him. "This is where people start dropping."

Eight keys remained from yesterday's twenty. They stood in the circle again, but today the Weaver at the center held no glowing spheres. Its hands were empty. Empty and waiting.

*Yesterday you learned to channel. To let energy flow without destroying yourselves.* The Weaver's telepathic voice was cold as always. *Today you learn to shape that energy. Give it form. Purpose.*

It raised one pale hand. Blue fire condensed above its palm—not a sphere this time, but a blade. Sharp-edged, crackling with power, bright enough to cast harsh shadows.

*Creation. Or destruction. Magic does not distinguish. You must.*

The blade vanished. The Weaver lowered its hand.

*Begin with simple forms. Light. Heat. Pressure. Master the basics before attempting complexity. Those who overreach will burn. Those who hesitate will fail. Find the path between.*

The keys exchanged nervous glances. No demonstration. No guidance beyond cryptic warnings.

Marcus flexed his marked palm. After last night's practice with Kira's crystal, his channels felt more open. Like pathways that had been cleared of debris. But shaping magic into specific forms? That was new territory.

He closed his eyes. Breathed. Drew energy up from his core, through his chest, down his right arm. Felt it pool in his palm.

Now what?

of yesterday's light. The crackling energy between his fingers. Could he do that again without the crystal?

Marcus focused on the image. Light. Simple light. Nothing sharp or dangerous. Brightness pooling in his palm.

Heat flared. His eyes snapped open.

A small flame danced above his hand. Actual fire, orange and flickering. Not what he'd intended, but something.

"Not bad for a beginner." Lily's soft voice came from his left. She held a sphere of water between her palms, perfectly contained. "Though you might want fire to be intentional next time."

Marcus grinned despite himself. "How'd you do that? The water?"

"It's what feels natural to me. My element, I guess." She let the sphere collapse, water splashing harmlessly to the stone floor. "Try thinking about what feels right for you. Not what you think you should do."

What felt right?

Marcus let the flame die. Closed his eyes again. What did he want? Not fire. Not water. Not blades or destruction.

He wanted... understanding. Clarity. To see things clearly.

Light.

He channeled again, but this time he focused on the concept than the form. Pure light. No heat. No danger. Illumination.

The energy shifted. Changed quality. When he opened his eyes, a soft golden glow emanated from his entire hand. Not flames. Not crackling electricity. Steady, warm light that pushed back the shadows without burning.

*Interesting choice.* The Weaver stood beside him. Marcus hadn't heard it approach. *Most keys default to aggressive manifestations. Weapons. Fire. Lightning. You chose illumination.*

"I don't want to hurt anyone," Marcus said quietly.

*That will make your mission difficult.*

"Maybe. Or maybe I'll find another way."

The Weaver tilted its head. That too-smooth motion that made Marcus's skin crawl.

*The Pattern does not reward idealism. Only results.* It moved on to observe Dmitri, who was generating small arcs of electricity between his hands.

Marcus kept the light steady, holding it as long as his stamina allowed. Two minutes. Three. His arm started shaking, but the glow didn't waver.

Finally, exhaustion forced him to release it. The light faded. Marcus slumped, breathing hard.

Around the circle, the other keys practiced their manifestations. Dmitri's lightning. Lily's water. A tall girl Marcus didn't know created small whirlwinds. An older man generated barriers of solid air.

No one attempted blades. No one shaped weapons.

Were they all thinking the same thing? That they didn't want to be killers?

Or were they building up to it gradually?

*Adequate progress.* The Weaver raised both hands, and the temperature in the chamber dropped. Frost formed on the walls. *But you have learned only creation. Now you must learn destruction.*

It gestured. A section of the stone wall shattered, revealing a chamber beyond filled with... targets. Wooden posts. Stone blocks. Metal plates hung on chains.

*Magic can show. It can also obliterate. You will practice both. Destroy the targets. Shape your energy into force. Into cutting edges. Into heat fierce enough to melt stone.*

The Weaver glided to the side.

*Begin.*

No one moved.

"We have to?" Lily whispered.

"It's training," Dmitri said, but he didn't sound convinced. "Not killing. ... breaking things."

Marcus stared at the targets. They were inanimate. Harmless. But destroying them felt like crossing a line. Like admitting he was willing to use magic as a weapon.

The older man stepped forward first. He raised his hands, and a concentrated blast of air hammered into a wooden post. It exploded into splinters.

"See?" Dmitri muttered. "practice."

He moved to the targets, calling lightning. The  across a metal plate, leaving scorch marks.

One by one, the others advanced. Lily hesitated longest, but eventually she shaped her water into a high-pressure jet that cracked stone.

Marcus was last.

He stood before a wooden post, identical to the one the older man had destroyed. Simple. Replaceable. Not alive.

But if he learned to break this, he'd be one step closer to breaking something that was alive. Someone.

*You hesitate.* The Weaver appeared beside him again. *Why?*

"Because once I learn this, there's no going back."

*You have already crossed that threshold. The Binding marked you. Changed you. You cannot return to ignorance.*

"I can choose not to become a weapon."

*You ARE a weapon. The question is whether you will be a sharp one or a dull one. Sharp weapons accomplish their purpose cleanly. Dull weapons cause unnecessary suffering.*

Marcus's hands clenched. "That's not—"

*If you refuse to train, you will be sent on your mission unprepared. When you face the tangle, you will fail. It will corrupt you. Then you will become the thing you sought to destroy.* The Weaver's telepathic voice grew colder. *I have seen this pattern before. Idealism becomes infection. Mercy becomes weakness. Weakness becomes catastrophe.*

"Or maybe I find a way to repair instead of destroy."

*Perhaps. But first you must survive long enough to try. And survival requires strength.* The Weaver pointed at the target. *Destroy it. Or acknowledge that you value your comfort over the lives of millions.*

The words hit like a physical blow.

Marcus turned back to the post. His marked palm burned.

He was right. The Weaver was right. If Marcus refused to learn combat magic, he'd go into his mission helpless. And helpless meant failure. Failure meant the Veil broke. The war returned. Millions died.

But if he learned to destroy, if he became what they wanted him to become...

Would there be anything left of the person he'd been?

Marcus raised his hand. Channeled energy. This time he didn't think about light or warmth or illumination. about breaking. Shattering. Force concentrated to a single point.

The energy condensed. Became denser. Harder. Like a hammer made of pure power.

He thrust his palm forward.

The wooden post exploded.

Chunks flew across the chamber. The sound echoed off stone walls. Where the post had stood, only splinters remained.

Marcus stared at his hand. It didn't look different. Didn't feel different. But he'd learned to destroy with a thought.

*Better.* The Weaver moved on.

Marcus lowered his hand slowly. Dmitri clapped him on the shoulder.

"Easier than you thought, yeah?"

"No," Marcus said quietly. "It was exactly as hard as I thought."

* * *

They ate lunch in the main hall. Real food this time—something that tasted like bread and cheese, though Marcus suspected it was made from ingredients that didn't exist on Earth.

Lily sat across from him, picking at her meal. "Does it bother you? The destruction practice?"

"Yeah." Marcus didn't see any point in lying. "Does it bother you?"

"I kept thinking... what if that stone block was a person? What if the Weavers tell us tomorrow to practice on something alive?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "What if they make us fight each other?"

Dmitri snorted. "They won't. Keys are too valuable. They'll send us on missions first. Controlled situations. Tangled things that need cutting."

"How do you know?" Lily asked.

"Because that's what they did to my brother." Dmitri's expression darkened. "He was a key too. Trained for eight months. Then they sent him through the Veil to eliminate a corruption node. He didn't come back."

Marcus set down his bread. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be. the risks. We all do." But Dmitri's hands clenched tight enough that his knuckles went white. "I'm here to finish what he started. Make his sacrifice mean something."

They sat in silence for a moment.

"I don't want to kill anyone," Lily said finally. "I know that makes me weak. Or naive. But I came here hoping to help people. To use magic for good."

"That doesn't make you weak," Marcus said. "That makes you human."

"Humans die when the Veil breaks," Dmitri pointed out. "All of them. Your world and mine both."

"So our choices are become killers or let everyone die?" Marcus pushed his plate away. "There has to be another option."

"Kira told me about a key who became a Mender," Lily said softly. "Who learned to heal corruption instead of cutting it out. She said his name was Evan."

Marcus sat up straighter. "She told you about him too?"

"Last week. When I was ready to quit after failing for the fortieth time." Lily glanced around, making sure no Weavers were near. "She said he's still here. In the Sanctum. Teaching other Menders."

"We should talk to him," Marcus said immediately.

"Bad idea." Dmitri leaned back. "The Weavers don't like Menders interfering with key training. If they catch you seeking alternatives to your mission, they'll accelerate your deployment. Send you through the Veil before you're ready."

"But if there's a chance—"

"There isn't. Not for the Veil tangle." Dmitri's voice was flat. "That thing has been growing for a millennium. It's not a small infection you can heal with magic bandaids. It's a cancer that's eaten through reality itself."

"You don't know that for sure."

"Neither do you. And betting millions of lives on a maybe?" He shook his head. "That's not brave. That's reckless."

Marcus wanted to argue. But Dmitri had a point. How could Marcus justify chasing a long-shot alternative when the Weavers had already provided a solution—brutal as it was?

"I still want to talk to Evan," Marcus said. "Even if he can't fix the big tangle, maybe he can teach me techniques. Ways to assess whether something can be repaired before I resort to killing."

Lily nodded. "That makes sense. Gather information. Keep options open."

"Fine." Dmitri sighed. "But if the Weavers find out and deploy you early, don't say I didn't warn you."

* * *

Finding Evan turned out to be easier than expected. The Mender wing was off the main hall, marked by a door carved with healing symbols. Marcus slipped away after afternoon training, when most keys were resting or practicing privately.

The wing was quiet. Small chambers lined a curved hallway, each one containing a simple bed and basic supplies. At the end of the hall, a larger room glowed with soft amber light.

Marcus approached. Inside, a man knelt beside a patient—one of the keys who'd failed yesterday's trial. The man's hands glowed green as he worked on the patient's burned palm. He was maybe thirty, with dark skin and gray streaks in his hair despite his youth. His binding mark curved around his right eye like a spiral.

"You're Marcus." The man didn't look up from his work. "Kira mentioned you might seek me out."

"You're Evan?"

"Former key. Current Mender. Professional disappointment to the Weavers." He finished his healing and sat back. The patient's hand was whole again, pink new skin replacing black burns. "You want to know if you can fix your tangle without killing anyone."

It wasn't a question.

"Can I?"

"Depends on the tangle." Evan stood, gesturing for Marcus to follow him to a smaller chamber. This one had diagrams on the walls—thread patterns, corruption maps, healing matrices. "Small tangles, yes. Places where threads have knotted or frayed but haven't started spreading corruption. Those you can smooth out, reinforce, heal."

He pointed to a diagram showing a tight cluster of threads with dark spots.

"Larger tangles, like the one eating the Veil, are different. The corruption has metastasized. Spread through hundreds of connected threads. Trying to heal it all at once would be like trying to cure every cancer cell in a body simultaneously. You'd die from the effort before you made progress."

"So it's impossible."

"I didn't say that." Evan pulled down another diagram—this one showing a single dark thread surrounded by damaged ones. "You don't have to heal everything at once. You identify the source. The primary infection. Cut THAT, surgically, and the rest has a chance to recover on its own. Like removing a tumor instead of poisoning the whole body."

Marcus studied the diagram. "So I still have to kill."

"You have to cut one thread. But ONE thread, carefully selected, instead of wholesale slaughter." Evan met his eyes. "The Weavers will tell you to kill the human host. Eliminate the vessel. But if you can find the exact moment of infection—the wound in the Pattern where the corruption started—you might be able to close it. Seal it. Let the person survive while still cutting off the source."

"Might be able to?"

"I've never done it. No one has, as far as I know. The theory is sound, but the practice?" He shrugged. "You'd be the first to try."

"What are the risks?"

"Death. Corruption. Becoming tangled yourself. The usual." Evan's expression softened. "But you're going to try anyway, aren't you? Even if I tell you it's nearly impossible."

"I have to try."

"Then I'll teach you what I can. Pattern reading. Thread manipulation. Precision cutting." He grabbed a blank sheet and started sketching. "But understand—this isn't mercy. It's surgery. And surgery fails more often than it succeeds."

Marcus watched him draw, hope and terror warring in his chest.

A chance. A real chance.

Even if it was a small one.
