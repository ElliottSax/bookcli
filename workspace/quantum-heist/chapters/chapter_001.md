# Chapter 1

The data stream pulsed across Sarah Chen's monitor at 2:47 AM, each line of code a whisper of something impossible. She leaned closer to the screen, her coffee forgotten, steam curling into the darkness of her MIT lab.

Three years. Three years of chasing ghosts in the financial markets, tracking anomalies her colleagues dismissed as statistical noise. But this—this was different.

The algorithm was real. And it was predicting market movements with terrifying accuracy.

Sarah pulled up the correlation data. Ninety-seven point three percent. No classical system could achieve that. The computational power required would dwarf anything on Earth.

Unless someone had cracked quantum computing for financial manipulation.

Her phone buzzed against the desk. Unknown number. Sarah stared at it, her hand hovering. At 2:47 AM, unknown numbers meant nothing good.

She answered. "Hello?"

"Dr. Chen." Male voice. Calm. Professional. The calm that came from complete confidence. "We need to discuss your research."

Ice flooded her veins. "Who is this?"

"Someone who knows you've been asking dangerous questions." A pause. Static crackled on the line. "Questions about the Shadow Protocol."

Sarah's Their breath came short and fast. She'd never written that name down. Never spoken it aloud. The term existed only in her notes, encrypted, buried three layers deep in her laptop's secure partition.

"How do you—"

The lights died.

Emergency systems kicked in, bathing the lab in red. Through the glass partition, Sarah saw shapes moving in the corridor. Three figures, black tactical gear, moving with military precision.

Not campus security.

She grabbed her laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard. One command. The hard drive ejected with a mechanical whir. She yanked it free, shoved it into her jacket pocket, and ran.

The lab door beeped. Someone had bypassed the lock.

Sarah hit the rear exit at full speed, the fire door crashing open. The stairwell stretched down eighteen floors. She took the stairs three at a time, one hand on the railing, the other clutching her laptop.

Above her, a door slammed open. Footsteps echoed, multiplying in the concrete shaft.

"Dr. Chen!" The voice from the phone, amplified by the stairwell. "This doesn't have to be difficult!"

Sarah kept running. Her lungs burned. The hard drive in her pocket felt like lead—proof of the Shadow Protocol, proof of the impossible algorithm, proof that someone was stealing trillions from the global markets.

She couldn't let them take it.

Ground floor. Sarah burst through the exit into the parking garage. Her Civic was two levels down, but they'd be expecting that. She pivoted toward the emergency exit, the one leading to the street.

A black SUV screeched around the corner, blocking her path.

Sarah skidded to a halt. Behind her, footsteps pounded closer. She was boxed in.

The SUV's rear door opened. A woman emerged—mid-forties, silver hair pulled back tight, expensive suit that screamed federal agent. She had the presence that commanded attention.

"Dr. Chen." The woman's voice carried across the garage. "Katherine Walsh. I'm here to offer you a choice."

Sarah's hand closed around the hard drive. "What choice?"

Walsh pulled out a tablet, tapped the screen. A map appeared—Boston, covered in red dots. Dozens of them. All converging on this location.

"Those are hostile operatives," Walsh said. "Looking for you. Looking for what you found. They don't negotiate."

The red dots were two blocks away. Closing fast.

"Who are they?"

"The people who built the Shadow Protocol." Walsh's expression hardened. "And you became the only person outside their organization who can prove it exists."

Sarah looked at the approaching dots, at Walsh's unwavering gaze, at the figures emerging from the stairwell behind her.

"Come with me," Walsh said, "help us stop them, and maybe we survive this. Or run, and see how long you last alone."

The tactical team from the stairwell rounded the corner. Five of them. Weapons drawn.

Sarah made her decision.

She ran toward Walsh's SUV and dove inside. The door slammed shut, and the vehicle launched forward, tires screaming against concrete. Through the rear window, Sarah watched the tactical team scatter as two more SUVs roared past them in pursuit.

"Buckle up," Walsh said calmly, returning fire through the shattered rear window.

Sarah fastened her seatbelt with shaking hands. Glass shards glittered across the leather seats. This was insane. Twenty-four hours ago, she'd been a professor. Now she was in a firefight through downtown Boston.

The SUV swerved hard right. Gunfire punched through the rear door. The driver—built like a linebacker, buzz cut, military tattoos visible on his forearms—didn't flinch.

"Rally Point Zebra," Walsh said into her radio. "Four minutes."

"We don't have four minutes," Sarah said, watching one of the pursuing vehicles close the gap.

Walsh smiled grimly. "Then we make our own time."

She leaned out the window and fired three precise shots. The pursuing SUV's front tire exploded. It spun out, crashed into a concrete barrier.

But two more appeared behind it.

The driver took a hard left onto the highway ramp. Sarah gripped the armrest as they accelerated to ninety. The pursuing vehicles matched their speed.

"There!" Walsh pointed to a warehouse ahead. "Drive through the door!"

"Through the—" Sarah started.

"Trust me!"

The driver floored it. The warehouse door grew larger, larger—Sarah closed her eyes.

They crashed through in an explosion of wood and metal. The SUV skidded to a halt inside. Figures in tactical gear swarmed them, pulling doors open.

"Go, go, go!" Walsh shouted.

Hands grabbed Sarah, pulled her from the vehicle. A helicopter descended through the warehouse's open roof, rotors thundering. Sarah was pushed inside, Walsh jumping in behind her.

The helicopter lifted off as the pursuing vehicles burst through the entrance. Gunfire sparked off the hull, but they were already climbing, already clear.

Sarah looked down at the shrinking warehouse, at the city lights spreading like a circuit board below. Her old life—her safe, academic life—disappeared beneath them.

Walsh handed her a headset. "Welcome to Task Force Quantum, Dr. Chen."

Sarah took it with numb fingers. The hard drive pressed against her ribs. Everything had changed in twenty minutes. Her career. Her safety. Her entire world.

But maybe—maybe she could make it count.

"I don't know where to start," Sarah said.

Walsh's smile was sharp. "Lucky for you, we do."

The helicopter banked east, toward an unknown destination. Below, the Shadow Protocol continued running. Stealing. Killing.

And now Sarah Chen was the only one who might be able to stop it.

The night swallowed them whole.
