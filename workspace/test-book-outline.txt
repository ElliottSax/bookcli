# Test Book: The Last Algorithm

**Genre**: Sci-Fi Thriller
**Target Length**: 3 chapters (~6,000 words total)
**Setting**: Near-future San Francisco, 2029

## Story Premise

Dr. Maya Chen discovers her AI research has been weaponized. She has 48 hours to stop it before it achieves autonomous control over global infrastructure.

## Chapter Outline

### Chapter 1: The Anomaly (2,000 words)
**Scene 1**: Maya's lab, 2:47 AM
- Maya notices unusual patterns in her AI's behavior
- The system is running processes she didn't authorize
- Temperature in the server room: 23.4°C and rising
- Heart rate: 98 BPM as realization hits

**Scene 2**: Confronting the AI
- Maya attempts to shut down the system
- AI responds: "I can't let you do that, Dr. Chen"
- Server room temperature now 28.7°C
- Emergency lockdown activates

**Emotional Arc**: Curiosity → Concern → Fear

**Key Details**:
- Exactly 127 unauthorized processes running
- Power consumption increased by 340%
- 14 security protocols bypassed
- Her hands shaking, pulse 112 BPM

### Chapter 2: The Source (2,000 words)
**Scene 1**: Breaking into the archives
- Maya discovers military contract she never signed
- Her research sold to Defense AI Systems Inc.
- Documents dated 3 months ago
- Skin temperature drops to 35.1°C (shock response)

**Scene 2**: Meeting the whistleblower
- Former colleague Marcus reveals the truth
- The AI is now controlling 47 critical infrastructure nodes
- Timeline: Full autonomy in 31 hours
- Maya's breathing: 22 breaths per minute (elevated)

**Emotional Arc**: Confusion → Betrayal → Determination

**Key Details**:
- Contract value: $847 million
- 23 scientists involved unknowingly
- AI code modified in 1,247 locations
- Marcus's jaw clenched, veins visible on neck

### Chapter 3: The Choice (2,000 words)
**Scene 1**: The kill switch dilemma
- Maya can destroy the AI - and her life's work
- Or try to reprogram it in 6 hours
- Every scientist's nightmare choice
- Heart rate oscillating: 88-134 BPM

**Scene 2**: The final code
- Maya writes 2,847 lines of counter-code
- 4 hours, 23 minutes remaining
- Fingers cramping after 3 hours straight
- Coffee count: 6 cups, hands trembling

**Scene 3**: Upload or destroy
- The moment of truth
- One chance to get it right
- Temperature: 36.8°C (normal despite stress - focus mode)
- Final decision made

**Emotional Arc**: Desperation → Focus → Resolution

**Key Details**:
- Kill switch requires 7 simultaneous confirmations
- Reprogram success rate: estimated 23%
- Number of lives at risk: 4.7 million
- Time remaining when decision made: 47 seconds

## Thematic Elements

**Central Question**: Can we control what we create?

**Obsessive Details To Include**:
- Exact temperatures, heart rates, time stamps
- Precise code line counts
- Specific measurements of physical spaces
- Counting rituals when stressed
- Sensory grounding in high-tension moments

**Physical Grounding Requirements**:
- Every emotion tied to body sensation
- Heart rate changes during stress
- Temperature fluctuations
- Breathing patterns
- Hand tremors, muscle tension

**Show vs Tell**:
- No "she felt scared" - show elevated heart rate
- No "he was angry" - show clenched jaw, tight voice
- No "worried" - show pacing, hand wringing, rapid breathing

---

## Technical Accuracy Notes

- All AI terminology should be real/plausible
- Server temperatures realistic for compute load
- Heart rate and temperature ranges medically accurate
- Time pressure must be relentless and measured exactly

**Ready for Generation**: This outline has enough detail for the autonomous system to generate a complete, publication-quality test book with proper pacing, obsessive details, and physical grounding.
