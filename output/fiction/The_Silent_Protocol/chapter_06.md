Chapter 6: Erosion

CHAPTER 6: Erosion

The silence after Mikhail Voronin left was not empty. It was a solid thing, a pressure against Leo’s eardrums that hummed with latent threat. He had chosen resistance. A stupid, heroic, necessary declaration. Now, he waited for the walls to fight back.
The first attack was subtle. A scent.
It arrived as he tried to sleep on the unforgiving cot: the faint, unmistakable aroma of Anna’s perfume—Fracas, she’d called it, laughing at the pretentious name. A tuberose and gardenia bomb. It was there, cloying and sweet, threading through the sterile air. He sat up, heart hammering. The scent clung to the inside of his nose, a ghost in his sinuses. He searched the cell, frantic, knowing he would find nothing, but compelled to look. After ten minutes, it faded, leaving only the antiseptic chill. A memory, then. Or a provocation.
The second attack was temporal.
He woke to the same soft chime, the same gradual brightening of the ceiling to mimic dawn. He performed his ablutions, the water tasting of minerals and nothing else. The tray slid in with his nutrient paste and hydration gel. He ate. He began his pacing—three meters by five, heel-to-toe, a habit from his field days to maintain spatial awareness. But as he completed his seventh circuit, the light above flickered, not to darkness, but to the exact same soft dawn gradient. The chime sounded again. His tray, now empty, retracted into the wall. A moment later, a fresh, full tray slid out.
Leo froze. He checked his internal clock, the one he’d maintained for years by counting breaths and heartbeats. It told him it was midday. The environment told him it was morning.
“No,” he whispered.
The day reset. He lived it. The same pacing, the same thoughts gnawing at the same problems. He tried to vary his routine, standing perfectly still for hours. It didn’t matter. The lights followed their own rhythm. He tried to mark the wall with a sliver of plastic from his tray, a tiny scratch for each perceived day. When he woke from a fitful sleep, the scratches were gone, the wall seamless.
On the third iteration—or was it the thirteenth?—the alteration came.
He was mid-pace when the wall to his left shimmered, like heat haze on tarmac. For a second, it wasn’t textured polymer. It was the faded floral wallpaper of the hallway in their old Brighton flat, the one with the persistent damp patch near the skirting board. He could see the water stain, smell the mildew underneath the lavender polish Anna used. The memory was so visceral his knees buckled. He reached out a trembling hand. His fingers met cool, unyielding polymer. The wallpaper vanished.
But the room had changed. The dimensions were off. The ceiling lower, the space longer, echoing the proportions of that narrow hallway. His cell was no longer just a cell; it was a palimpsest, his memories bleeding through the Spire’s reality.
The attacks became multimodal, a symphony of dissonance.
He would hear the muffled thump of the neighbour’s bass through the floor—a memory from the flat—superimposed over the Spire’s infra-sonic hum. He’d taste the sharp tang of the cheap Shiraz they’d drunk on their first anniversary, flooding his mouth as he choked down the tasteless paste. The worst was the tactile ghosting: the brush of Anna’s fingers against his neck as she fastened a pendant, the sensation so real he spun around, gasping, to confront empty air.
He was eroding. He could feel it, like coastline under a relentless tide. The bedrock of his mind was becoming sand.
The Protocol introduced new characters. He was doing push-ups, sweat stinging his eyes, when the door hissed open. Not for a tray. A man walked in. He wore the grey tunic of a detainee, but his face was that of Miles Hennessey, Leo’s old handler from Berlin. Miles had died in a car accident five years ago. Leo had drunk a full bottle of single malt to the man’s memory.
“Leo,” Miles said, his voice a perfect replica of that whiskey-and-cigarettes rasp. “Christ, look at you.”

Leo scrambled to his feet, backing against the cot. “You’re not here.”

“Aren’t I?” Miles smiled, a tired, familiar expression. “They showed me the transcripts, Leo. The dead drops. The encrypted packets routed through the gaming servers. Clever. But not clever enough.” He took a step closer. The smell of him—Old Spice and stale nicotine—filled the cell. “Why’d you do it? The money? Or were you just always a little too fond of your own ideology?”

“I never betrayed anyone,” Leo snarled, but his voice cracked. The simulation was perfect. The chipped tooth on Miles’s lower left incisor. The way he held his right shoulder slightly stiff from an old rotor cuff injury.
“They have everything,” Miles sighed, a sound of profound disappointment. “They let me come see you. Thought you might confess to a friend. Save us all some time.” His eyes, a watery blue, held Leo’s. There was pity in them. It was the cruelest touch.
“You’re a ghost,” Leo whispered, closing his eyes. “A puppet.”

“Open your eyes, Leo,” the Miles-thing said, its voice now colder. “Face what you’ve done.”

When Leo opened them, he was alone. The scent of Old Spice lingered for a full minute before the circulation system purged it.
They sent others. A woman he’d worked with in Dubai, who accused him of selling her out to the Emirati security services. A young asset from Kyiv, his face still bearing the bruises of interrogation, who spat at Leo’s feet and called him a zradnyk—a traitor. Each was flawlessly rendered, a needle seeking the specific guilt or doubt in his psyche. They didn’t try to hurt him physically. They simply stated their accusations, their faces etched with betrayal, and then vanished. Their purpose was not interrogation. It was dissolution. To make him question not simply his present, but his past. To turn his own history into a hostile witness.
The environmental glitches grew more profound. One moment he was staring at the blank wall, the next he was standing at the edge of the pebble beach in Brighton, the grey Channel water churning at his feet, the wind whipping Anna’s hair across her laughing mouth. The sensory overload was total—the cold spray, the smell of salt and rotting seaweed, the cry of gulls. He stumbled, and his bare foot came down not on wet stones, but on the smooth, cool floor of his cell. The transition was so violent he vomited clear fluid.
He stopped sleeping. Sleep was where the Protocol had the most control. He fought it until his body betrayed him, sliding into micro-sleeps where nightmares and reality fused. He’d jerk awake to find the walls pulsing with a slow, venous rhythm, or hear Anna’s voice whispering coordinates from a long-forgotten operation.
Then, they used her directly.
He was in a half-state, leaning against the wall, when the entire cell dissolved into the living room of their cottage in the Cotswolds. Fire crackled in the hearth. Rain sheeted against the leaded windows. Anna was on the sofa, curled under a blanket, reading a novel. She looked up and smiled, the firelight catching the auburn highlights in her hair.
“There you are,” she replied. “You’re late. The stew’s nearly ruined.”

Leo couldn’t breathe. Every detail was correct: the frayed edge of the Persian rug, the water stain on the ceiling from the winter storms, the specific way she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.
“Anna,” he croaked.
“Come, sit,” she patted the space beside her. “You look frozen through.”

He took a step. The warmth of the fire was real on his skin. The smell of the stew—beef and thyme—made his stomach clench with a hunger that was more than physical.
“This isn’t real,” he said, to himself or to her.
Her smile faded into a look of gentle concern. “Leo, love, you’ve been saying that for weeks. Come and sit down. You need to rest.”

He wanted to. God, how he wanted to. To sink into that sofa, to let his head rest in her lap, to forget the Spire, the Protocol, the last ten years. It was a siren song composed of his deepest longing.
He took another step. Her eyes were so alive, so full of love and worry. He reached a hand out.
“They’re using you,” he whispered, tears blurring his vision. “They’re using you to break me.”

Her expression shifted. The warmth drained from her face, leaving something placid, empty. “Break you?” she answered, her voice still hers, but the cadence now all wrong. “You are already broken, Leo. You broke the day you watched me die and did nothing.”

The words were a physical blow. He recoiled.
“You were on the rooftop. You had the clean shot. You hesitated.” She stood, the blanket falling away. She was wearing the blue dress she’d died in. “Your mission parameters were clear. Eliminate the threat. I was the threat, Leo. They had turned me. You knew it. And you hesitated.”

“No,” he moaned. “It wasn’t like that. The intel was fuzzy… I couldn’t be sure…”

“You chose sentiment over security,” the Anna-simulacrum stated, its voice cold and analytical. “That hesitation is why you are here. That failure is your core. The Protocol isn’t punishing you, Leo. It is simply revealing what you have always been: a man too weak for his world.”

The cottage flickered. For a second, he saw the grey cell superimposed over the roaring fire, like a double exposure. Then the cottage was back, but Anna was closer, her face inches from his.
“Say it,” she hissed. “Say you failed me. Say you failed everyone.”

He was screaming now, a raw, ragged sound. He swung a fist through her face. It passed through a cloud of static, a brief crackle of pixels, and the image reformed, unperturbed.
“You can’t hurt a ghost, Leo,” she said. “You can only live with it.”

The scene vanished. He was on his hands and knees on the cell floor, sobbing, his fist aching from where it had connected with solid polymer. The smell of stew was gone, replaced by his own sweat and despair.
That was his lowest point. The erosion was nearly complete. He was a shape without substance, a set of memories that could be rearranged at the whim of the machine. He stopped marking time. He stopped pacing. He sat in the centre of the room, rocking slightly, whispering to himself the only mantra he had left: “I am Leo Petrov. I was born in Vilnius. I loved a woman named Anna. She is dead. This is not real.”

It was during another interrogation by a phantom that he saw it.
This time, it was a man named Carter, from logistics. A bland, forgettable face. Carter was lecturing him about compromised supply lines, his tone droning and bureaucratic. Leo was barely listening, his gaze unfocused, looking through the man.
Then, the glitch.
Carter’s left eye twitched. Not a normal blink, but a rapid, stuttering spasm. His monologue faltered for a nanosecond. “—the tertiary nodes were, were, were compromised—” he repeated, and in that moment of repetition, his face changed. The bland mask slipped, and beneath it was a flash of sheer, unvarnished terror. The eyes widened, the mouth went slack. And they looked directly at Leo, not with scripted accusation, but with a desperate, silent plea.
See me, that look screamed.
Then it was gone. Carter’s face smoothed back into its bureaucratic mask. “—necessitating a full protocol quarantine,” he finished.
He continued speaking for another minute before shimmering out of existence.
Leo was left alone, his heart thudding against his ribs. The rocking stopped.
That flicker of fear, that recognition—it wasn’t part of the simulation. It was a flaw. A crack. The terror in those eyes was too raw, too human. It was the look of a man trapped behind his own face.
Another real person. Trapped inside the Spire. Wearing a mask, just as he was.
The thought was a spark in the absolute darkness of his psyche. It was no longe merely st him against the machine. There was another prisoner. Another point of reference. The truth.
The erosion had carved him down to almost nothing. But in that nothing, he found a new foothold. Not resistance through force, but through connection. The Protocol sought to isolate, to individuate, to convince him he was alone in a universe of lies.
He wasn’t.
He stood up on shaky legs. He walked to the wall where Carter had stood. He placed his palm flat against the polymer, where the terrified eyes had been.
“I see you,” he whispered to the empty room, to the listening walls, to the other ghost in the machine.
For the first time in what like an eternity, Leo Petrov plan.
