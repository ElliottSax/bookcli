Chapter 1: The Tenth Year

The anniversary arrived not with a bang, but with a silent, digital pulse. A single, precise vibration from the subdermal monitor nestled against his ulna bone. 11:17 PM Moscow time. Right on schedule. The ‘all clear.’

His apartment on the 87th floor of The Spire—a needle of smoked glass and reinforced steel piercing the perpetual Moscow gloom—stood as a monument to sterile, curated luxury. Pale oak floors met furniture of severe angles and muted greys. A single pane of glass offered a dizzying view of the city’s constellation of lights. Less a home than the world’s most expensive cell. He’d designed the feeling himself. Comfort was a vulnerability.

In the bathroom, the only room without a camera, he avoided the tired, forty-two-year-old face of Ilya Sokolov in the mirror. His thumb and ring finger applied specific, practiced pressure to two faint scars on his wrist, activating the secondary scan. A tiny, holographic glyph shimmered in the air above his skin, invisible without the corresponding polymer contact lens: a complex, shifting knot of light. Langley’s annual affirmation. *You are not forgotten. The mission is live. Maintain cover.*

The Tenth Year. A decade inside the belly of the beast. Mikhail Voronin’s beast. The reclusive oligarch owned The Spire, the quantum computing firm it housed, and, if Agency whispers were correct, the ear of the Kremlin’s deepest shadows. His job was to get close, to become indispensable, to find the keys to Voronin’s cryptographic empire. After ten years, he was Ilya Sokolov, Voronin’s paranoid and brilliantly effective head of systemic security. He was also Leo Volkov, a ghost, a man who had buried himself so deep the edges of the grave sometimes blurred.

A flush for audio cover, then a return to the main room. The ‘all clear’ should have been a comfort. Instead, it settled like a verdict. Another year in the silent protocol.

That’s when the cleaner appeared.

The Spire was automated down to its soul. Human janitors were a liability; they had eyes, they talked. Sleek discs of white plastic hummed through the halls at night. Through his apartment’s reinforced polymer peephole, one moved down the corridor on its prescribed route, spraying a fine mist, twin brushes whirring.

It reached the end of the hall, near the emergency stairwell. Protocol demanded a 180-degree pivot and return. It did not. A soft forward advance ended with a bump against the wall. A retreat, then another advance. Another bump. A soft, persistent *thump-thump-thump*. Seven times. A malfunction. A simple glitch.

But ten thousand hours of suspicion chilled his blood. He knew the cleaning logs, the pathing algorithms. He’d helped debug them. A collision-avoidance error would trigger a diagnostic halt and a wireless alert. This unit wasn’t avoiding; it was insisting. *Thump-thump-thump.* Like a moth against glass. Or a code.

After the seventh impact, it simply reversed and resumed its normal route, as if nothing had happened. The hall fell silent but for the vanishing hum. His shoulder blades pressed against the cool wall. A fist knocked against his ribs. *It’s a glitch. It has to be a glitch.* The security protocols for hardware failure recited themselves in his mind, a calming, familiar mantra. But the image persisted: mindless, repetitive bumping against a wall that led only to a sealed stairwell.

* * *

The next morning, the glitch had a companion.

His weekly secure video call with his handler, “Martha,” was scheduled for 09:00 hours from his office. The connection routed through a daisy-chain of proxies, the video feed heavily encrypted. Martha appeared on screen, her kind, grandmotherly face belying a mind like a steel trap. They exchanged coded pleasantries about “family health.”

“Your nephew’s graduation went smoothly,” she said, her voice slightly lagged. *Extraction plans are dormant.*

“Good to hear. Send my regards to his sister,” he replied. *Understood. Maintaining position.*

During the exchange, the painting caught his eye. Martha’s backdrop never changed: the faux wood paneling of a generic Langley safe-room, a framed print of a sailboat on a calm sea to her left. Today, the sailboat remained. But the water betrayed the scene. In thousands of calls, the boat had always cut through small, choppy whitecaps. Now, the sea lay preternaturally calm, a flat, glassy blue. The boat seemed to float on a sheet of plastic.

“The weather looks calm on your end,” he said, his voice casual.

Martha’s smile didn’t flicker. “Perpetually sunny in the office, you know that.”

The call ended. He sat very still. Protocol automatically scrubbed the video file. No proof remained. A digital artifact? A compression error? They didn’t make errors like that. Not here. Not with this pipeline.

A low-grade hum of dread began in his teeth, a vibration just below hearing. An anchor was needed, something external, indisputable. Pulling up a global news site on The Spire’s dedicated, ultra-secure network, he chose something trivial, universal: the football scores from the English Premier League. The live ticker read: Manchester United 1, Aston Villa 0. 72nd minute.

On a whim, he used his personal, clandestine satellite link—a risk, but a tiny one—to access the same feed. The satellite feed showed Manchester United 1, Aston Villa 1. 72nd minute.

A refresh of The Spire’s feed. A second later, it updated: Manchester United 1, Aston Villa 1.

A one-second delay. In a global sports feed. Inside The Spire, information was notjust curated; it was buffered. Why? To scrub it? To alter it? The implications unspooled in his mind, dark and endless. Every piece of data he consumed, from news to weather to market prices, passed through a tiny, artificial lag. A edit window. A chance for the building itself to tell him what was true.

The paranoia was no longer a tool; it was the atmosphere. He was breathing it in.
* * *
By evening, the dread had crystallized into a hard, professional need to know. He needed system logs, raw data. He needed to see the guts of the night.

A minor, building-wide “power fluctuation” had been logged at 03:00 AM. Harmless. But it had triggered a brief fail-over to backup systems, including the security camera buffers in the sub-levels—areas that were technically under his purview but which Voronin had declared permanently off-limits, patrolled only by autonomous systems. Leo had never questioned it. Every palace had its dungeons.

Now, he hacked his own permissions. It wasn’t difficult; he’d built the backdoors himself. He accessed the archived footage from Sub-level 3, corridor West, timestamped 03:02 AM.

The screen showed an empty, concrete-lined corridor. Harsh LED lights, motion-activated, created pools of illumination separated by stretches of deep shadow. Conduits and pipes ran along the ceiling. It was cold, industrial, a stark contrast to the curated warmth above.

For three minutes, nothing. Then, at the far end of the corridor, a figure stepped from a shadow into a pool of light.

Leo leaned forward, his nose almost touching the screen.

The man was tall, wearing the dark blue overalls of a senior engineering technician. He had a narrow, sharp face, a hawkish nose, and a distinctive, loping walk—a slight hitch in his right step, as if an old injury never quite healed.

Recognition hit Leo like a sucker-punch to the diaphragm. The air left his lungs in a silent rush.

Anatoly Vassiliev.

The name was a tombstone in his mind. Five years ago, in a muddy field outside Kiev, under a different name and a different flag, Leo had provided the targeting confirmation. He’d watched through a scope as Vassiliev, an FSB wetwork specialist, got into his car. He’d heard the confirmation of the drone strike thirty seconds later. They’d recovered pieces of the DNA. Vassiliev was dead. Vaporized.

Yet here he was, walking calmly down a forbidden corridor in the heart of Voronin’s Spire. The same face, the same hawkish nose, the same damn hitch in his step.

Leo’s hands trembled. He fumbled to pause, zoom, enhance. The image pixelated, but the features were unmistakable. This was not a cousin, not a twin. This was the man. Alive.

The figure on screen paused, turned his head, and looked directly up at the camera. It wasn’t a casual glance. It was a look of cold, deliberate assessment. His lips moved, forming two silent words in Russian.

Leo didn’t need audio. He knew the shape of them on the lips.

Hello, Leo.

Then the figure stepped back into the shadow. The motion-activated lights clicked off, plunging that end of the corridor into absolute blackness. The timestamp ticked forward. He never reappeared.

Leo Volkov sat in the humming silence of his secure office, high above the sleeping city. The ‘all clear’ glyph from Langley felt like a lie burned into his flesh. The glitching robot, the altered painting, the buffered news—they were not malfunctions. They were cracks. Cracks in the reality he inhabited, and through them, the terrible truth was bleeding in.

He was not in a skyscraper. He was in a construct. A prison of information and perception. And the warden, a ghost from his own past, had just looked him in the eye and called him by his real name.

The mission was over. Something else had begun.
