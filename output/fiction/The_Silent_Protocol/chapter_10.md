Chapter 10: Breaking the Cycle

CHAPTER 10: BREAKING THE CYCLE

The air in the service corridor tasted of ozone and stale fear. Leo pressed his back against the humming conduit, the vibration traveling up his spine like a constant, low-grade tremor. Through a grated vent at eye level, he watched The Heart.

It was a cathedral of data. Rows of black server racks, studded with flickering LEDs like malevolent constellations, receded into a gloom pierced only by the cold, blue glow of status lights. The air here was different—crisp, refrigerated, smelling of ionized metal. In the center of the room, elevated on a dais, was the master terminal: a sleek, monolithic console, its dark screen a void. A single figure, one of Mikhail Voronin’s technicians in a grey jumpsuit, moved with languid boredom between the aisles, checking readings. This was the brain. This was the god that had built his world, then shattered it.

Stealth was a prayer for a patient man. Leo was out of prayers.

Anya’s face, pale and drawn in the greenish monitor glow of her pod, was etched behind his eyes. “They are not simulating to understand you, Leo. They are simulating to delete you. To overwrite. The you that you are is… inconvenient.” Her words, parsed and re-parsed during his crawl through the building’s guts, had crystallized into a cold, hard truth. The Protocol wasn’t a prison for rehabilitation. It was a foundry for forging something else. Someone else. And he was the raw material being melted down.

He had mapped the physicality of his cage: the coolant pipes overhead, thick as his thigh, snaking from the external chillers into The Heart. His fingers, tracing schematics on a dusty maintenance panel an hour before, had found the vulnerability. The primary and secondary cooling loops converged at a junction valve, VK-7, just behind the server row designated A-1. A manual override there could force a cascade failure. It would be crude. It would be loud.

It was time to be a wrench.

He moved from the vent, slipping into The Heart through a service hatch disguised as a server panel. The cold bit through his stolen technician’s coveralls. The sound was immense—a roaring white noise of spinning drives and whirring fans, a digital wind howling through a canyon of silicon. He kept low, using the server aisles as cover, his footsteps swallowed by the ambient roar.

Junction VK-7 was where the schematic promised. A nest of pipes and analog gauges, a relic of the building’s original infrastructure left in place for emergency manual control. His hands, slick with a cold sweat, found the large red wheel lock on the primary feed. He took a breath, the air scraping his throat.

He thought of the endless, sun-drenched beach of his simulation. The way the light was always perfect, the waves always rhythmic, the peace so absolute it felt like suffocation. He thought of the glitch—the single, terrifying frame of Anya’s real face, a crack in the porcelain sky of his fake heaven. That crack had been a lifeline.

He heaved.

The wheel screamed, a metallic shriek that cut through the server drone. It fought him, corroded from years of disuse. He threw his weight into it, tendons standing out in his neck. With a final, grinding shriek, it spun freely. He cranked it shut. The primary coolant feed to Server Row A-1 ceased.

Immediately, a different hum entered the chorus—a straining, rising pitch. He moved to the secondary loop, found its release valve, and opened it fully. Super-cooled fluid, meant as a backup trickle, now flooded into the stagnant primary line with violent pressure.

He ducked into an aisle as the first alarm sounded—a soft, choral ping from the master terminal. The technician looked up from his tablet, frowning. Leo watched the temperature gauges on the junction climb. From green to yellow. Yellow to amber.

The technician stood, tapping at his tablet. The pings came faster, merging into a single, insistent tone.

Then, with a sound like a giant’s stomach growling, the pipe at Junction VK-7 burst.

It wasn’t an explosion, but a violent, pressurized eruption. A jet of milky coolant vapor, freezing cold, blasted into Server Row A-1. The LEDs on the first three racks flickered madly, then died. The alarm shifted from a ping to a whooping, building-wide klaxon. Red emergency lights strobed, turning the serene blue cathedral into a hellish disco.

“System overload in Sector A! Thermal event!” the technician yelled into his wrist, panic shredding his voice. He ran toward the junction, then skidded to a halt as the vapor cloud spread, frosting the floor. “Initiate emergency purge! Initiate—”

His words were cut off as the master terminal screen flashed a violent, blinding white. Then it went black. The whooping alarm stuttered. The roaring server wind began to die, rack by rack, like a beast gasping its last. The silence that followed, punctuated only by the hiss of escaping coolant and the frantic, dying sputters of electronics, was more deafening than the noise.

Partial system reboot initiated, a calm, androgynous voice announced over the PA. Containment protocol in effect.

The lights died. For three heartbeats, absolute, perfect blackness swallowed The Heart. Then the emergency batteries kicked in, bathing the room in a dim, sulfurous yellow.

Leo was already moving, sprinting through the swirling, freezing vapor toward the dais. The technician was a shadow, coughing and disoriented. Leo didn’t break stride. His elbow caught the man on the temple with a sickening thud, and he dropped like a sack.

The master terminal screen flickered back to life, displaying a stark, minimal boot sequence. It was vulnerable. For maybe ninety seconds, the Protocol’s highest-level security would be offline, rebooting its core services. The walls were still there, but the guard dogs were asleep.

Leo’s fingers flew over the keyboard. He bypassed the login with a root-access backdoor he’d theorized existed—a failsafe for Mikhail Voronin’s engineers. The system, groggy, accepted it. He was in.

File directories unfolded, a labyrinth of obscenely classified projects. He saw his own name, his simulation logs, terabytes of neural maps. He saw others—codenames he didn’t recognize. He saw “Morana-7”—Anya. He opened it. Video feeds from her pod showed her strapped into a neural interface chair, her body limp, her eyes moving rapidly beneath closed lids. A real-time encephalogram showed brainwave patterns that were not sleep, not dreaming, but a violent, jagged struggle.

There was no time to save, to study. Only to burn.

He found the core data repository: /Protocol/Silent/Genesis. He selected it all. Every log, every simulation seed, every neural imprint, every record of their stolen lives. He initiated a transfer. The destination couldn’t be traced back to him, to any safe-house or ally he could no longer trust. It had to be a dead drop in the sky.

He typed in a random, public cloud storage address—a string of numbers and letters generated by his pounding heart. He set the encryption to zero. He wanted it raw. He wanted it naked. He hit enter.

Data Dump Initiated. Estimated time: 45 seconds.

A progress bar crawled across the screen. 5%. 10%. The system was sluggish, damaged.

From the corner of his eye, he saw movement. Not the technician. A new figure, silhouetted in the emergency-lit doorway at the far end of The Heart. Tall, broad, moving with a predatory calm that the chaos did not touch. Leo knew the shape, the posture. It was the head of security, the man he’d seen only in glimpses through Mikhail Voronin’s office door in the sim. His name was Krayev. In this reality, he was even larger.

Krayev’s eyes scanned the room, bypassing the hissing coolant, the fallen technician, and locking directly onto Leo at the terminal. He didn’t run. He began to walk, unbuttoning his suit jacket.

25%. The bar crept.

Leo abandoned the terminal. His path to Pod 7 was the opposite direction, through the server aisles. He leapt from the dais and plunged into the narrow canyon between two racks, the yellow light creating strobing bars of shadow and glare.

Krayev altered course, intercepting. Leo could hear the measured, heavy tread of his shoes on the grated floor.

40%. Come on.

He burst out of the end of the aisle just as Krayev turned into it. They faced each other across ten feet of open space, the hiss of the coolant their only soundtrack. Krayev had a face like weathered granite, his eyes two chips of flint. He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to. The message was in the way he settled his weight, the way his hands—knuckles scarred, fingers thick—opened and closed.

“The reboot will finish in sixty seconds, Mr. Koval,” Krayev said, his voice a low rumble. “The doors will re-lock. The systems will re-engage. You have nowhere to go.”

55%.

“I’m not going,” Leo said, the words raw. “I’m leaving.”

He charged. It wasn’t tactical. It was kinetic, a release of every pent-up second of manipulated peace, every phantom memory, every lie he’d ever lived. He led with a wild right hook.

Krayev slipped it effortlessly, his own fist a piston that buried itself in Leo’s solar plexus. All the air in the world vanished. Leo folded, gasping, hitting the cold floor. The world tunneled.

70%.

Anya. In the chair. Eyes moving under lids.

Leo rolled as a polished shoe stamped down where his head had been. He scrambled backwards on hands and knees, sucking in a ragged, burning breath. Krayev advanced, methodical, a butcher closing in.

Leo’s hand brushed against a fallen object—the technician’s heavy, rubber-coated flashlight. His fingers closed around it. As Krayev leaned down to grab him, Leo swung.

The crack against Krayev’s kneecap was a satisfying, solid thwack. The big man grunted, stumbling back a step. Leo surged up, swinging again, a backhand aimed at the temple. Krayev caught his wrist this time, his grip like a hydraulic press. Bones ground together. Leo cried out, dropping the light.

With a contemptuous twist, Krayev threw him into a server rack. Leo’s shoulder connected with sharp metal, and he slid down, seeing stars. The world pulsed with the yellow emergency light.

85%.

Krayev loomed over him, pulling a compact black taser from his belt. “Mikhail Voronin wants your mind intact,” he growled. “He didn’t specify the condition of the rest of you.”

Leo, slumped against the rack, saw it. A frayed, dangling service cable, its insulation shredded by the freezing coolant, sparking intermittently. He kicked out with his last strength, not at Krayev, but at the rack itself. It rocked backwards with a shriek of metal.

Krayev, surprised by the move, took a half-step to the side. His leg brushed against the sparking cable.

There was a loud pop, a flash of blue light, and the smell of burning wool and ozone. Krayev’s body went rigid, a guttural sound escaping his clenched teeth. He toppled sideways, crashing to the floor, smoke curling from his trouser leg.

Data Dump Complete. The PA voice was back, but strained, glitching.

Leo pushed himself up, his body a symphony of pain. He staggered past Krayev’s twitching form, past the dead terminals, toward the far wall. According to his mental map, Pod 7 was on the other side. There was no door here. Only a seamless, white wall panel.

He found the almost-invisible seam. He dug his bleeding fingers into it. Nothing. It was magnetically sealed, the reboot nearly complete. The systems would re-engage any second. He would be locked in, with a waking Protocol and an enraged Krayev.

He looked back at The Heart. At the junction box where it had all begun. At the pipes.

He ran back, his breath sobbing in his chest. He grabbed the heavy, fallen flashlight. He returned to the wall, to the seam. He didn’t try to pry. He reversed his grip on the flashlight, raised it like a pickaxe, and with a scream that came from the very core of his being, he brought the metal end down on the wall, right where the locking mechanism should be.

Once. Twice. On the third blow, the panel dented. On the fifth, it cracked. On the seventh, with a shriek of tearing metal and a shower of sparks, the seal broke. The panel buckled inwards.

He tore at it, peeling back the sharp metal like a can lid. Beyond was a small, dark, clinical room. And in the center, under a single, cold downlight, was Anya.

She was real. More real than anything had ever been. She was strapped into a reclining chair of polished steel and leather, a grotesque crown of wires and sensors fused to her shaved scalp. More leads were taped to her temples, her chest. Her skin was the color of parchment, her lips chapped and parted. A thin line of drolet trailed from her mouth. Her eyes, open now, were the same fierce green he’d seen in the glitch, but they were unfocused, staring at nothing, swimming with residual digital ghosts.

“Anya,” he choked, stumbling to her side. His hands fumbled with the leather restraints on her wrists. They were tight, cutting into her flesh. “Anya, it’s me. It’s Leo.”

Her eyes drifted toward his voice. A flicker of recognition, then terror. “The… beach,” she whispered, her voice a dry rustle. “It’s… pulling. It’s so loud…”

“It’s not real,” he said, finally freeing one wrist, moving to the other. “None of it was. We have to go. Now.”

He tore the sensor pads from her chest, wincing as she gasped in pain. The crown of wires was locked. He found the release at the nape of her neck—a simple mechanical catch. He pressed it. The device hissed and loosened. He lifted it from her head, revealing a scalp mapped with red pressure marks.

The moment it left her, her whole body convulsed. She arched off the chair, a silent scream on her lips. Then she collapsed, limp, but her eyes cleared. They focused on him, truly focused, for the first time.

“Leo?” The name was a revelation.

He got an arm under her, hauling her up. She was dead weight, muscles atrophied from disuse. “Can you stand?”

“I… I think.” Her legs buckled, but she held onto him, her fingers digging into his arm with desperate strength. Her breath was hot and ragged against his neck. “They were… layering a new conscience. A compliant one. It was… eating me.”

“It’s over,” he said, guiding her toward the torn-open hatch. It was a lie, but a necessary one.

They stumbled through into the chaos of The Heart. The reboot was complete. The server lights were flickering back on, one rack at a time. The whooping alarm had settled into a steady, pulsing alert. And from the corridors beyond, a new sound emerged: the synchronized, pounding tread of running boots. Many of them.

Mikhail Voronin’s real security force. Finally, fatally alerted.

Leo pulled Anya toward the only other exit he knew—the service hatch he’d entered through. It seemed a thousand miles away. The first black-helmeted figure appeared in the main doorway, rifle raised.

“Halt! Down on the ground!”

Leo didn’t halt. He shoved Anya ahead of him into the narrow server aisle, just as a burst of automatic fire tore into the rack beside them, shredding metal and silicon with a sound like hell’s own typewriter.

They were rats in a maze. A maze that was now awake, armed, and very, very angry. He had broken the cycle. But the walls of the world had just contracted, hard and final, around them. And they were running out of corners.
