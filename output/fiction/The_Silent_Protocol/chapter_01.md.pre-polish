Chapter 1: The Tenth Year

Chapter 1: The Tenth Year

The anniversary arrived not with a bang, but with a silent, digital pulse. Leo Volkov felt it in his wrist, a single, precise vibration from the subdermal monitor nestled against his ulna bone. 11:17 PM Moscow time. Right on schedule. The ‘all clear.’

He was in his apartment on the 87th floor of The Spire, a needle of smoked glass and reinforced steel piercing the perpetual Moscow gloom. The room was a monument to sterile, curated luxury—pale oak floors, furniture that was all severe angles and muted greys, a wall that was a single pane of glass offering a dizzying view of the city’s constellation of lights. It felt less like a home and more like the world’s most expensive cell. He’d designed the feeling himself. Comfort was a vulnerability.

Leo walked to the bathroom, the only room without a camera. He didn’t look at the tired, forty-two-year-old face in the mirror—the face of Ilya Sokolov, security consultant—but at his own wrist. With a specific, practiced pressure from his thumb and ring finger on two faint scars, he activated the secondary scan. A tiny, holographic glyph, invisible to anyone not wearing the corresponding polymer contact lens he’d just inserted, shimmered in the air above his skin: a complex, shifting knot of light. Langley’s annual affirmation. You are not forgotten. The mission is live. Maintain cover.

The Tenth Year. A decade inside the belly of the beast. Mikhail Voronin’s beast. The reclusive oligarch who owned The Spire, the quantum computing firm it housed, and, if Agency whispers were correct, the ear of the Kremlin’s deepest shadows. Leo’s job was to get close, to become indispensable, to find the keys to Voronin’s cryptographic empire. After ten years, he was Ilya Sokolov, Voronin’s paranoid and brilliantly effective head of systemic security. He was also Leo Volkov, a ghost, a man who had buried himself so deep he sometimes forgot where the grave began.

He flushed the toilet for the audio cover and returned to the main room. The ‘all clear’ should have been a comfort. It felt, instead, like a verdict. Another year in the silent protocol.

That’s when he saw the cleaner.

The Spire was automated down to its soul. Human janitors were a liability; they had eyes, they talked. So autonomous floor-cleaners, sleek discs of white plastic, hummed through the halls at night. Leo watched one now through his apartment’s peephole—a fisheye lens of reinforced polymer. It moved down the corridor on its prescribed route, spraying a fine mist, twin brushes whirring.

It reached the end of the hall, near the emergency stairwell. It should have pivoted 180 degrees and returned. It did not. It continued forward, bumping softly into the wall. It retreated, then advanced again, bumping the same spot. A soft, persistent thump-thump-thump. It did this seven times. A malfunction. A simple glitch.

But Leo’s blood, trained by ten thousand hours of suspicion, went cold. He knew the cleaning logs, the pathing algorithms. He’d helped debug them. A collision-avoidance error would trigger a diagnostic halt and a wireless alert. This unit wasn’t avoiding; it was insisting. Thump-thump-thump. Like a moth against glass. Or a code.

He watched until, after the seventh impact, it simply reversed and resumed its normal route, as if nothing had happened. The hall was empty, silent but for the vanishing hum. Leo stepped back, his shoulder blades pressing against the cool wall. His heart was a fist knocking against his ribs. It’s a glitch. It has to be a glitch. He recited the security protocols for hardware failure in his mind. It was calming, familiar. But the image persisted: the mindless, repetitive bumping against a wall that led only to a sealed stairwell.

The next morning, the glitch had a companion.

Leo’s weekly secure video call with his handler, “Martha,” was scheduled for 09:00 hours from his office. The connection was always routed through a daisy-chain of proxies, the video feed heavily encrypted. Martha, a woman with a kind, grandmotherly face that belied a mind like a steel trap, appeared on screen. They exchanged coded pleasantries about “family health.”

“Your nephew’s graduation went smoothly,” Martha said, her voice slightly lagged. Extraction plans are dormant.

“Good to hear. Send my regards to his sister,” Leo replied. Understood. Maintaining position.

It was during this exchange that Leo noticed the painting. Martha’s backdrop was always the same: the faux wood paneling of a generic Langley safe-room, a framed print of a sailboat on a calm sea to her left. Today, the sailboat was there. But the water was wrong. In the thousands of calls, the boat had always cut through small, choppy whitecaps. Today, the sea was preternaturally calm, a flat, glassy blue. The boat seemed to float on a sheet of plastic.

“The weather looks calm on your end,” Leo said, keeping his voice casual.

Martha’s smile didn’t flicker. “Perpetually sunny in the office, you know that.”

The call ended. Leo sat very still. The video file was, by protocol, automatically scrubbed. He had no proof. A digital artifact? A compression error? But they didn’t make errors like that. Not here. Not with this pipeline.

A low-grade hum of dread began in his teeth, a vibration just below hearing. He needed an anchor, something external, indisputable. He pulled up a global news site on The Spire’s dedicated, ultra-secure network. He chose something trivial, universal: the football scores from the English Premier League. He watched the live ticker. Manchester United 1, Aston Villa 0. 72nd minute.

On a whim, he used his personal, clandestine satellite link—a risk, but a tiny one—to access the same feed. The satellite feed showed Manchester United 1, Aston Villa 1. 72nd minute.

He refreshed The Spire’s feed. A second later, it updated: Manchester United 1, Aston Villa 1.

A one-second delay. In a global sports feed. Inside The Spire, information was not just curated; it was buffered. Why? To scrub it? To alter it? The implications unspooled in his mind, dark and endless. Every piece of data he consumed, from news to weather to market prices, passed through a tiny, artificial lag. A edit window. A chance for the building itself to tell him what was true.

The paranoia was no longer a tool; it was the atmosphere. He was breathing it in.

By evening, the dread had crystallized into a hard, professional need to know. He needed system logs, raw data. He needed to see the guts of the night.

A minor, building-wide “power fluctuation” had been logged at 03:00 AM. Harmless. But it had triggered a brief fail-over to backup systems, including the security camera buffers in the sub-levels—areas that were technically under his purview but which Voronin had declared permanently off-limits, patrolled only by autonomous systems. Leo had never questioned it. Every palace had its dungeons.

Now, he hacked his own permissions. It wasn’t difficult; he’d built the backdoors himself. He accessed the archived footage from Sub-level 3, corridor West, timestamped 03:02 AM.

The screen showed an empty, concrete-lined corridor. Harsh LED lights, motion-activated, created pools of illumination separated by stretches of deep shadow. Conduits and pipes ran along the ceiling. It was cold, industrial, a stark contrast to the curated warmth above.

For three minutes, nothing. Then, at the far end of the corridor, a figure stepped from a shadow into a pool of light.

Leo leaned forward, his nose almost touching the screen.

The man was tall, wearing the dark blue overalls of a senior engineering technician. He had a narrow, sharp face, a hawkish nose, and a distinctive, loping walk—a slight hitch in his right step, as if an old injury never quite healed.

Recognition hit Leo like a sucker-punch to the diaphragm. The air left his lungs in a silent rush.

Anatoly Vassiliev.

The name was a tombstone in his mind. Five years ago, in a muddy field outside Kiev, under a different name and a different flag, Leo had provided the targeting confirmation. He’d watched through a scope as Vassiliev, an FSB wetwork specialist, got into his car. He’d heard the confirmation of the drone strike thirty seconds later. They’d recovered pieces of the DNA. Vassiliev was dead. Vaporized.

Yet here he was, walking calmly down a forbidden corridor in the heart of Voronin’s Spire. The same face, the same hawkish nose, the same damn hitch in his step.

Leo’s hands trembled. He fumbled to pause, zoom, enhance. The image pixelated, but the features were unmistakable. This was not a cousin, not a twin. This was the man. Alive.

The figure on screen paused, turned his head, and looked directly up at the camera. It wasn’t a casual glance. It was a look of cold, deliberate assessment. His lips moved, forming two silent words in Russian.

Leo didn’t need audio. He knew the shape of them on the lips.

Hello, Leo.

Then the figure stepped back into the shadow. The motion-activated lights clicked off, plunging that end of the corridor into absolute blackness. The timestamp ticked forward. He never reappeared.

Leo Volkov sat in the humming silence of his secure office, high above the sleeping city. The ‘all clear’ glyph from Langley felt like a lie burned into his flesh. The glitching robot, the altered painting, the buffered news—they were not malfunctions. They were cracks. Cracks in the reality he inhabited, and through them, the terrible truth was bleeding in.

He was not in a skyscraper. He was in a construct. A prison of information and perception. And the warden, a ghost from his own past, had just looked him in the eye and called him by his real name.

The mission was over. Something else had begun.
