  "genre": "thriller",
  "subgenre": "espionage",
  "premise": "A deep-cover CIA officer, embedded for a decade in a Moscow tech oligarch's inner circle, discovers his entire mission is a fabrication. The oligarch's 'secure' skyscraper is not a headquarters, but a next-generation panopticon prison, and he is the sole, unwitting inmate in an experiment to break a spy without them ever knowing they were captured.",
  "protagonist": "Leo Voss, a brilliant but emotionally isolated CIA NOC (Non-Official Cover) officer who has lived as 'Mikhail,' a trusted cybersecurity chief.",
  "conflict": "Leo must use the very surveillance system that entraps him to convince his skeptical handlers 5,000 miles away that he is a prisoner, not a defector, while his 'employer' psychologically dismantles his identity to extract a secret he genuinely does not possess.",
  "setting": "Present-day Moscow, primarily within the confines of the 'Zvezda Tower,' a sleek, hyper-connected smart building that is a gilded cage of omnipresent sensors and AI-driven manipulation.",
  "tone": "Paranoid, claustrophobic, and cerebral, blending high-tech dread with the visceral panic of a man realizing his entire reality is a hostile construct."
