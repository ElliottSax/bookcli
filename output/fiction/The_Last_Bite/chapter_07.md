 “This is exquisite,” Thorne said, his voice thick with wine and food. “A masterpiece. You’ve outdone yourself, Lysander.”

Lysander smiled, his teeth flashing white in the dim light. “I’m glad you approve, Marcus. It’s a dish that demands respect, wouldn’t you say?”

Thorne chuckled, wiping his mouth with his napkin. “Absolutely. And I always respect a good meal.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance watched as Thorne took another bite, his fork scraping against the plate. She could see the faintest hint of a tremor in his hand, a barely perceptible flicker of uncertainty. The poison was working. She knew the symptoms—numbness, dizziness, then paralysis. It was only a matter of time.

She glanced around the table, her eyes meeting those of the woman two seats down. The woman’s face was pale, her eyes wide with fear. She had barely touched her food, her fork hovering over the plate as if it were a live wire.

Elara Vance Vance Vance leaned forward, her voice low. “Don’t eat it,” she whispered. “It’s poisoned.”

The woman’s eyes widened in shock. “What?”

“Trust me,” Elara Vance Vance Vance said, her voice barely audible. “Just don’t eat it.”

The woman nodded, her hands trembling as she pushed her plate away. Elara Vance Vance Vance turned her attention back to Thorne. His breathing had grown labored, his chest rising and falling with a visible effort. His face was flushed, his eyes glazed.

“Marcus?” Elara Vance Vance Vance said, her voice laced with concern. “Are you alright?”

Thorne looked up at her, his lips curling into a weak smile. “Fine,” he said, his voice strained. “Just… a bit warm.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance watched as Thorne’s hand slipped from the table, his fork clattering to the floor. His eyes rolled back, his body slumping forward. The other guests gasped, their chairs scraping against the floor as they scrambled away from the table.

Lysander stood, his voice calm. “It seems we have a medical emergency. Someone call an ambulance.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s heart pounded in her chest. She knew it was too late for Thorne. The poison had already taken hold. But she also knew that she couldn’t let Lysander get away with this. She had to act fast.

She stood, her chair scraping against the floor. “I think we need to call the police,” she said, her voice steady. “This wasn’t an accident.”

Lysander’s eyes met hers, a cold smile playing on his lips. “And why would you say that, Elara Vance Vance Vance?”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s hand tightened around the stem of her wine glass. “Because I know what you’ve done,” she said, her voice low. “And I won’t let you get away with it.”

The room fell silent, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. Elara Vance Vance Vance knew she was taking a risk, but she also knew she couldn’t back down now. She had to confront Lysander, to expose his crimes before he could silence her.

She took a deep breath, her eyes never leaving his. “You poisoned him,” she said, her voice steady. “And I think you’ve poisoned others too. You’re a murderer, Lysander. And I won’t let you get away with it.”

Lysander’s smile widened, his eyes gleaming with a cold, calculating light. “You’re a brave woman, Elara Vance Vance Vance,” he said, his voice soft. “But you’re also very, very foolish.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s heart pounded in her chest, but she refused to back down. She knew she was playing a dangerous game, but she also knew she had no choice. She had to expose Lysander, to bring his crimes to light before he could silence her.

She took a step forward, her voice low. “You won’t get away with this,” she said, her eyes never leaving his. “I won’t let you.”

Lysander’s smile faded, his eyes narrowing. “You have no idea what you’re dealing with, Elara Vance Vance Vance,” he said, his voice cold. “You’re in way over your head.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s hand tightened around the stem of her wine glass, her knuckles white. “I know exactly what I’m dealing with,” she said, her voice steady. “And I won’t let you get away with it.”
