Chapter 2: A Pattern of Revenge

Chapter 2: A Pattern of Revenge

The rain in the city had a particular taste—a metallic tang of exhaust and wet stone that clung to the back of the throat. Elara stood under the awning of a boarded-up bodega, watching the droplets smear the neon sign of the 12th Precinct into a bleeding wound of pink light. Inside that concrete block, Simon Bell’s life had been reduced to a case number and a coroner’s report. She couldn’t walk in as Elara Vance, the pariah. But she could walk in as someone else.

Her old contacts were like forgotten spices in the back of a cupboard—potent if still viable. Detective Mark Ruiz had once loved her writing, had told her over a terrible precinct coffee that her review of a Filipino food truck had made him cry for his Lola’s cooking. That was before the scandal, when her byline meant something. She dialled, the phone slick in her palm.

“Ruiz.”

“Mark. It’s Elara Vance.”

A pause, filled with the static of surprise and, she feared, disdain. “Jesus. Vance. I heard you were… out of the game.”

“I’m freelance now. Working on a piece about the changing face of food media. Simon Bell’s death came across the wire. Tragic. I wondered if I could buy you a coffee, get a few bland, on-background quotes about the risks of the job.”

Another pause. She could hear the squawk of a radio, the murmur of voices behind him. He was considering. She leaned into the persona, the ghost of her former self: confident, connected, harmless. “Off the record, Mark. Just colour. The Times is paying a pittance, but I could meet you at Donatello’s.” She named the old Italian café he loved, where the espresso was thick as tar.

“One coffee,” he said, his voice gruff. “Four-thirty. Don’t make me regret this.”

Donatello’s was a cave of dark wood and bitter aroma. Ruiz arrived, his trench coat dark at the shoulders from the rain, his face etched with a tiredness that had little to do with the hour. They exchanged brittle pleasantries. When the espressos arrived, tiny black pools in white china, she went in.

“Simon’s death. It seems so… extreme. A food critic.”

Ruiz stirred a sugar cube into his cup, watching it dissolve. “You know how it is. People are passionate about food. Unhinged, sometimes.”

“But a murder? Over a review?” She let her skepticism show, the journalist digging for a better quote. “Was it a robbery?”

He met her eyes then, and she saw the professional caution warring with his need to talk about the bizarre case eating up his week. “No robbery. Nothing taken. Place was… set up. Like a dinner party for one. He was in his dining room, at the table. Cause of death was anaphylactic shock. Severe, rapid-onset. Epi-pen was on the table, just out of reach.”

Elara’s skin prickled. “An allergy?”

“Peanut oil. High-grade, apparently. The kind chefs use for finishing. But it was in everything. Slicked on the steak he’d been eating, whipped into the potatoes, even drizzled on the chocolate torte for dessert. His review notes were on the table, too. For the restaurant he’d visited that night.”

“Which was?”

Ruiz sipped his espresso, grimaced. “Place called ‘Le Cénacle’. Fancy new French fusion. Got a savage panning from Bell a week ago. The owner has an alibi, rock solid. Whole kitchen staff does.”

Le Cénacle. She committed it to memory. “And the meal at his home? Who prepared it?”

“That’s the million-dollar question. No signs of forced entry. Bell had a standing order with a gourmet delivery service, but they swear the meal they dropped off was peanut-free. This was… swapped. Or augmented. Forensics found traces of the oil under his fingernails, on the rim of his water glass. He tried to wash it down.” Ruiz’s voice was flat, but the image was vivid, grotesque. A man realizing, mid-bite, that his last meal was his execution.

“A message,” Elara murmured, almost to herself.

“Maybe. But there’s more.” Ruiz leaned forward, lowering his voice. “You didn’t hear this. Two other deaths in the last six weeks. Similar… presentation. Martin Fry, the old-school newspaper critic for the Chronicle. Found in his study. Official cause: acute alcohol poisoning. He’d apparently consumed a bottle of 1945 Château Mouton Rothschild that was, according to the tox screen, laced with a near-lethal concentration of pure, food-grade methanol. The bottle was on his desk, next to a printed copy of his most recent review.”

“And the third?”

“Kid named Aiden Choi. ‘The Gastronaut’ on YouTube. Two million subscribers. Found in his production studio. Asphyxiation. A custom-made, air-tight cloche—one of those silver dome things they put over plates—had been sealed over his head. The air inside was infused with a vapourised concentrate of ghost pepper capsaicin. His lungs were… cooked. On his editing monitor, paused, was his latest video. A review.”

Elara’s blood had gone cold. The sensory details were horrifically specific, culinary, intimate. “All critics. All negative reviews?”

Ruiz nodded. “Fry eviscerated a new Nordic tasting-menu place. Choi did a viral takedown of a molecular gastronomy pop-up called ‘Ephemera’. Bell, as you know, hated Le Cénacle.”

She finished her espresso, the bitterness grounding her. “They’re not random. It’s a pattern. A… curation.”

“The brass thinks it’s copycats. Unconnected. Too different in method.” Ruiz’s expression said he didn’t agree. “But I’ve got nothing to tie them together. No witnesses, no forensics that lead anywhere but to a dead end of specialty food suppliers.”

“Can I see the reports? The redacted versions? It would give my piece some depth.”

He eyed her for a long moment, then sighed, pulling a thumb drive from his coat pocket and sliding it across the sticky table. “Background only. You cite me, I’ll deny it. And Vance?” He stood, dropping a few bills on the table. “Be careful. Someone’s cooking up a storm of vengeance, and they’ve got a hell of a palate.”

Back in her apartment, the rain streaking the windows like tears on a dirty cheek, Elara plugged in the drive. The clinical police language couldn’t sanitize the horrors. Fry’s study, described as “orderly,” noted a “crystal decanter and single glass present, subject’s fingerprints only.” The Château Mouton, a mythical vintage. To a oenophile like Fry, the temptation would have been irresistible. His review of “Nordic Hearth” had been brutal: “A glacial exercise in pretension. The reindeer heart tartare tasted less of the tundra and more of the abattoir, a cryogenic disappointment.”

Aiden Choi’s studio was detailed with cold precision. The cloche, “professional grade, stainless steel, custom-fitted with a nebulizer apparatus.” The ghost pepper concentrate, “a artisanal product available only through select online retailers.” His review of “Ephemera” was a masterpiece of sardonic vlogging: “They call this ‘deconstructed apple pie.’ I call it a crime against pastry, a cloud of cinnamon-scented arrogance that evaporates on the tongue, much like my will to live after paying three hundred dollars for it.”

And Simon. Simon, who had written, via her own poisoned pen, of Le Cénacle: “The chef here doesn’t cook food; he commits assault with a frying pan. The duck confit was less confit and more conflated ego, a greasy monument to a talent that has clearly packed its bags and left the city.”

Three devastating reviews. Three meticulously crafted deaths, each weaponizing the victim’s own gourmet sensibilities. She cross-referenced the restaurants. Nordic Hearth. Ephemera. Le Cénacle. Different cuisines, different owners, different parts of the city. No obvious link.

She dug deeper, into the evidence logs. Fry’s scene: “trace organic material found under subject’s fingernails and on lip of glass: identified as Tuber melanosporum (Périgord black truffle) and Caviar (Beluga, pre-2005 ban).” Exorbitant, rare. Choi’s scene: “residue within nebulizer: identified as Capsicum chinense (Ghost Pepper) and Vanilla planifolia (Tahitian vanilla bean).” The vanilla, a bizarre, sweet counterpoint to the lethal pepper. Simon’s scene: “oil analysis confirms Arachis hypogaea (high-oleic peanut oil) and presence of Crocus sativus (saffron) stigma.”

Her breath caught. Not just any ingredients. These were signatures. A flourish. The killer wasn’t just murdering; they were plating. Each scene was a dish, a final, ironic critique served to the critic.

She returned to the victims’ notes, their final reviews. Buried in Fry’s printed copy was a throwaway line: “One wonders if the chef might find a more receptive audience at one of those secretive supper clubs, like the Ouroboros thing one hears whispers about in certain circles. There, style over substance is presumably the whole point.”

In Choi’s video, a quick, off-hand remark during a rant about exclusivity: “This is the kind of place that probably wishes it was the Ouroboros Club, where you need a blood sample and a vow of silence just to see the menu.”

Simon’s notes, in his own handwriting on a legal pad beside his plate, had a single, circled phrase: “Ouroboros Club? Check if Le Cénacle chef is an alum.”

The name shimmered in the digital gloom of her apartment. The Ouroboros Club. A serpent eating its own tail. The symbol of cyclicality, of destruction and rebirth. She searched. Nothing. No website, no listing, no social media. Only forum whispers on deep-foodie sites, references so vague they seemed like myth. An invite-only dining experience for the ultra-wealthy and the jaded elite. A place where the boundaries of cuisine were said to be… fluid. Where a negative review was not just bad form, but a transgression.

It was the thread. Thin as a strand of saffron, but it connected them. All three critics had mentioned it, dismissed it, in the context of panning a restaurant. Had they been warned? Had they insulted not just a restaurant, but the club itself? Or someone within it?

The rain had stopped. The city outside her window glistened, a feast of lights. But Elara saw only the crime scene photos: Fry’s contorted face, the beautiful bottle; Choi’s hands clawing at the silver dome; Simon, his lips blue, a last bite of torte on his fork. Her fork. Her words.

A wave of nausea, hot and sour, rose in her throat. She had written the weapon that killed Simon. The guilt was no longer a vague, haunting shadow; it was a physical thing, a bolus of undigested horror lodged behind her sternum.

She spent the next day in a fugue, chasing phantoms. Calling in every remaining favour from her years in the industry, she probed the name ‘Ouroboros Club’. She was met with silence, nervous laughter, or abrupt hang-ups. A sommelier she’d once saved from a bad review muttered, “You don’t find the Ouroboros, Elara. It finds you. And you don’t want it to,” before clicking off.

The apartment grew dark. She didn’t bother with lights, sitting at her desk surrounded by printouts, the thumb drive, and her own gnawing culpability. The city’s sounds were muffled, distant. She was adrift in a sea of consequence, and the water was thick with the taste of truffle, vanilla, and blood.

A soft, distinct thud at her door broke the silence.

Not a knock. The sound of something being slipped through the mail slot. Her heart stuttered against her ribs. She waited, frozen, for five long minutes before creeping to the door.

On the worn floorboard lay a single, thick envelope. It was cream-coloured, heavy stock, and utterly plain. No address, no stamp. It had been hand-delivered.

With trembling fingers, she picked it up. It felt dense, important. She carried it to her desk, under the pool of light from her lamp. Using a letter opener, she slit the top.

Inside was a card, the same exquisite paper. The inscription was in a sharp, elegant calligraphy that seemed etched into the fibre:

You have tasted the bitterness of consequence.
You have seen the final plate.
Your palate is judged to be… discerning.

The Ouroboros Club offers a chance for culinary redemption.
A single seat has been secured in your name.
The feast of reckoning awaits.

Tomorrow. 11 PM. The address will be revealed to the committed.
Come alone. Come fasting.

And at the bottom, embossed into the paper with such subtlety she felt it more than saw it, was a symbol: a serpent, coiled in a perfect circle, its tail in its mouth. Pierced through its centre, like a pin through a specimen, was a stylised, long-tined fork.

The same symbol she’d seen doodled in the margin of Simon’s notes.

The air left her lungs. The room seemed to tilt, the shadows in the corners deepening, pooling. They knew. They knew she was looking. They knew she had written the review. This wasn’t an invitation. It was a summons. To walk into the belly of the beast that had consumed three critics. To sit at the table where the menu was murder.

Her hands were ice. The card smelled faintly of something familiar, something expensive and dry. She lifted it to her nose.

Saffron. And beneath it, the faint, nutty, lethal scent of high-oleic peanut oil.
