 m motionless, her breath shallow, her mind racing. The silver had done its work—she could feel the faint metallic burn in her throat, the way her saliva had thickened. It was a gamble, but the silver dust had neutralized the cyanide, or at least delayed its effects long enough for her to play dead. Now, she had to wait. Wait for them to leave, to believe she was gone.

She heard Lysander’s footsteps recede, the soft click of the kitchen door. Celeste’s heels followed, slower, more deliberate. The silence that settled over The estate (primary setting) was heavy, suffocating. Elara Vance Vance Vance counted her breaths, each one a careful, controlled measure of air. She listened for the distant hum of the restaurant, the clink of glasses, the murmur of diners. It was a world away, a world she might never see again.

But she was alive. And that was enough.

She waited, her body still, her mind sharp. The seconds stretched into minutes. Then, finally, she heard the sound of the kitchen door opening again. Footsteps, lighter this time. A pause.

“Elara Vance Vance Vance?”

Her eyes flew open. Celeste stood over her, her face pale, her expression unreadable. Elara Vance Vance Vance’s heart hammered in her chest, but she forced herself to remain still, her body limp, her breath shallow.

“You’re not dead,” Celeste said, her voice a whisper. “I knew it. I could feel it.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance didn’t move. She didn’t speak. She waited.

Celeste crouched beside her, her fingers brushing the pulse point in Elara Vance Vance Vance’s neck. “You’re alive,” she breathed, her voice a mix of awe and disbelief. “How?”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s lips parted, just slightly. “The silver,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “It neutralized the cyanide.”

Celeste’s eyes widened. “You knew,” she said, her voice a mix of admiration and horror. “You knew what we were doing, and you still came.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s gaze met hers, steady and unflinching. “I had to,” she said. “I had to know the truth.”

Celeste’s fingers tightened on her wrist, her grip almost painful. “You’re a fool,” she said, her voice a low growl. “You should have stayed away. You should have let us be.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s lips curled into a faint, bitter smile. “I couldn’t,” she said. “I had to see it for myself. I had to taste it.”

Celeste’s eyes flashed with something dark and dangerous. “You’re not leaving here,” she said, her voice a low, menacing growl. “You’re not walking out of here alive.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s heart pounded in her chest, but she didn’t flinch. She didn’t look away. “Then kill me,” she said, her voice steady and calm. “But know this: I will haunt you. I will haunt you in every dish you serve, in every bite you take. I will be the ghost in your kitchen, the shadow in your soul. You will never be free of me.”

Celeste’s breath hitched, her eyes wide with something like fear. “You’re bluffing,” she said, her voice a whisper. “You’re just trying to scare me.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s smile widened, a cold, cruel thing. “Am I?” she said, her voice a low, dangerous purr. “Or am I the only one who sees the truth?”

Celeste’s fingers tightened on her wrist, her grip almost painful. “You’re a fool,” she said, her voice a low growl. “You’re a fool, and you’re going to die.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s heart pounded in her chest, but she didn’t flinch. She didn’t look away. “Then kill me,” she said, her voice steady and calm. “But know this: I will haunt you. I will haunt you in every dish you serve, in every bite you take. I will be the ghost in your kitchen, the shadow in your soul. You will never be free of me.”

Elara Vance Vance Vance’s smile widened, a cold, cruel thing. “Am I?” she said, her voice a low, dangerous purr. “Or am I the only one who seeing the truth?”

The air between them was thick with tension, the silence heavy and suffocating. Elara Vance Vance Vance’s heart pounded in her chest, but she didn’t move. She didn’t look away. She held Celeste’s gaze, her eyes steady and unflinching.

Then, suddenly, Celeste’s grip on her wrist loosened. She stood, her body stiff and tense, her eyes wide and wild. “You’re right,” she said, her voice a low, dangerous growl. “You’re right. You’re the only one who sees the truth. And that’s why you have to die.”
