To uncover the killer, she must infiltrate the club's exclusive, deadly tasting menu, where each course is a clue and a potential crime scene.",
  "protagonist": "Elara Vance, a former Pulitzer-nominated critic with a hyper-developed palate and a deep-seated fear of failure, who uses her knowledge of food and the cutthroat culinary world as her primary investigative tools.",
  "conflict": "Elara must solve the murders and expose the killer before she becomes the next target on the menu, all while battling her own demons and the killer's taunting, food-themed riddles left at each crime scene.",
  "setting": "Present-day, in the high-stakes, glamorous yet gritty culinary underworld of a major city like New York or Chicago, moving from Michelin-starred kitchens to hidden, illicit dining rooms.",
  "tone": "Darkly suspenseful and atmospheric, with a gourmet's sensual detail contrasted against visceral horror; think 'Hannibal' meets 'The Menu' with a classic whodunnit structure."
