Chapter 3: The Invitation

The city’s rain was a greasy sheen on the library window, blurring the neon glow of downtown into weeping watercolors. Elara Vance sat in the hushed, archival gloom of the Culinary Historical Society, a place that smelled of dust, old paper, and the ghost of a thousand forgotten meals. For three days she’d chased whispers, and they’d led her here, to brittle pamphlets and society pages from a century past.

The Ouroboros Club. It was a phantom, a name uttered in the same reverent, fearful tone sommeliers used for mythical vintages. It appeared in a 1923 gossip column—“Where does the cream of society retire after the opera? To the serpent that eats its own tail, of course!”—and vanished again until a 1958 memoir of a disgraced diplomat mentioned “seeking absolution at the Ouroboros table.” The most recent trace was a footnote in a graduate thesis on experiential dining, citing an anonymous interview: “It’s not about the food. It’s about the consequence of tasting it.”

Elara’s fingers, smudged with newsprint, trembled slightly. Simon was dead. So were two others. All critics. All negative reviews. After sleepless nights cross-referencing their final published pieces, she’d discovered a peculiar commonality: each had destroyed a rising culinary star with a particular, almost gleeful cruelty. The chef Simon had eviscerated, a man named Kael, had vanished after the review, his restaurant shuttered. The connection was a gossamer-thin thread leading into a dark labyrinth. The Ouroboros Club felt like its heart.

To follow it, she had to stop being Elara Vance, disgraced ghostwriter and pariah. She had to become someone they would invite.

“You’re out of your mind, El.” Marcus’s voice was a tinny rasp from her phone, pressed between her shoulder and ear as she drove home later. Marcus was her last tether to her old life, a tech-savvy researcher from the magazine who’d been fired for less ethical, more digital transgressions.

“Probably,” she conceded, her eyes on the wet streets. “But I need the identity. Impeccable. Old money, but not too traceable. A reclusive heiress with a passion for gastronomy, traveling incognito.”

He sighed, a sound of static and reluctant admiration. “Eleanor Voss. Deceased grandfather made a fortune in obscure manufacturing. She’s been living abroad, managing vineyards in Argentina. Minimal social footprint, but enough digital dust to feel real. I can build you a passport, credit trails, the works. It’ll cost you.”

“I have the last of Simon’s advance.”

“It’s not money I want,” Marcus said, his voice dropping. “If this place… if it’s what the whispers say, it’s a black hole. Things go in, they don’t come out. I need to know what you find.”

The forged documents arrived two days later in a plain manila envelope. Eleanor Voss’s passport was cool and weighty in her hand, the photo her own face, but altered—hair darker,
