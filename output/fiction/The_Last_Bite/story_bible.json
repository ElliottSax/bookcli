  "plot_summary": "The story begins with Elara in a state of sheer terror in her own home, frozen as a ominous figure (Celeste) enters. This confrontation is the culmination of a long-simmering, deeply personal conflict. The narrative builds through this tense, psychological standoff, rooted in their shared history within the estate. The climax occurs in the kitchen, a place of supposed sustenance now stained by violence. Here, with the efficient, brutal tool of a boning knife present, the emotional and physical conflict reaches its peak and then dissipates into exhausted quiet. The resolution comes not with further violence, but with a word\u2014'over'\u2014and a symbolic act: placing the key to the cellar (representing locked-away secrets and trauma) between them. As authorities arrive, Elara chooses to walk away from the shadows of her past into the clean, uncertain light of dawn, having ended the battle but acknowledging the long road of rebuilding that lies ahead for both women.",
