The dim fluorescent lights above flickered, casting an eerie glow over the small, cluttered room. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and worn leather. Across from me, Rachel sat with her arms crossed, her eyes fixed intently on the worn, wooden table between us.

"So, you're saying this 'Two-Minute Start' Technique is a trick?" she asked, her voice laced with skepticism.

I shook my head, a slow smile spreading across my face. "No, Rachel. It's not a trick. It's a redesign of the initiation threshold. You're lowering the bar to the point where resistance becomes irrelevant."

Rachel raised an eyebrow, her expression a mix of curiosity and wariness. "And how exactly does this work?"

I leaned forward, my elbows on the table, my hands clasped together. "The act of starting, even for just two minutes, changes your physiology. Your posture shifts. Your breathing deepens. Your brain transitions from 'I don't want to' to 'I'm doing.'"

Rachel's eyes narrowed, her gaze piercing. "That sounds like a bunch of New Age nonsense."

I chuckled, a low, rumbling sound. "It's not nonsense, Rachel. It's science. The brain is wired to respond to immediate gratification, but what if I told you that you could rewire your brain to respond to the anticipation of something better?"

Rachel's expression softened, her eyes clouding over with curiosity. "Go on."

I leaned back in my chair, my hands clasped behind my head. "The Rebel's power is in the 'not yet.' The Rebel's veto is rendered obsolete. When you start, even for just two minutes, you're giving yourself permission to take the first step. You're giving yourself permission to say 'yes' to the unknown."

Rachel's eyes locked onto mine, her gaze intense. "And what's the point of all this?"

I smiled, a slow, enigmatic smile. "The point is to break free from the cycle of resistance and fear. The point is to take control of your life, to take control of your choices. The point is to become the Rebel."

Rachel's expression changed, her eyes flashing with a spark of recognition. She leaned forward, her elbows on the table, her hands clasped together. "I think I'm starting to get it," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's the first step, Rachel. The first step is to start."

The room fell silent, the only sound the soft hum of the fluorescent lights above. Rachel's eyes locked onto mine, her gaze intense. "Okay," she said, her voice firm. "I'll start."

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's all I can ask for, Rachel. That's all anyone can ask for."

As we sat there, the silence between us grew thicker, more oppressive. It was as if the very air itself was charged with anticipation, with possibility. And then, without warning, Rachel stood up, her movements fluid, effortless.

"I'll start," she said, her voice firm. "I'll start right now."

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's the spirit, Rachel. That's the Rebel's spirit."

Rachel took a deep breath, her eyes locked onto mine. "I'll start," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'll start for two minutes."

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's all I ask for, Rachel. That's all anyone can ask for."

As Rachel began to count down from two, her voice steady, firm, I felt a sense of excitement, of anticipation. It was as if the very air itself was charged with possibility, with promise. And then, without warning, Rachel stopped counting, her eyes locked onto mine.

"Okay," she said, her voice firm. "I'm starting."

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's the first step, Rachel. The first step is to start."

As Rachel began to move, her movements fluid, effortless, I felt a sense of pride, of satisfaction. It was as if I had helped her unlock a part of herself, a part that had been hidden, locked away for far too long.

The room fell silent, the only sound the soft hum of the fluorescent lights above. Rachel's eyes locked onto mine, her gaze intense. And then, without warning, she smiled, a slow, enigmatic smile.

"I'm doing," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's the Rebel's power, Rachel. That's the Rebel's veto."

As we sat there, the silence between us grew thicker, more oppressive. It was as if the very air itself was charged with anticipation, with possibility. And then, without warning, Rachel stood up, her movements fluid, effortless.

"I'm doing," she said, her voice firm. "I'm doing for two minutes."

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's all I ask for, Rachel. That's all anyone can ask for."

As Rachel continued to move, her movements fluid, effortless, I felt a sense of excitement, of anticipation. It was as if the very air itself was charged with possibility, with promise. And then, without warning, Rachel stopped, her eyes locked onto mine.

"Okay," she said, her voice firm. "I'm done."

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's the Rebel's power, Rachel. That's the Rebel's veto."

As we sat there, the silence between us grew thicker, more oppressive. It was as if the very air itself was charged with anticipation, with possibility. And then, without warning, Rachel stood up, her movements fluid, effortless.

"I'm the Rebel," she said, her voice firm. "I'm the Rebel."

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face. "That's the first step, Rachel. The first step is to start."

As Rachel walked out of The protagonist's home office (primary symbolic setting), her movements fluid, effortless, I felt a sense of pride, of satisfaction. It was as if I had helped her unlock a part of herself, a part that had been hidden, locked away for far too long.

The room fell silent, the only sound the soft hum of the fluorescent lights above. I sat there, my eyes locked onto the empty space where Rachel had been. And then, without warning, I stood up, my movements fluid, effortless.

I was the Rebel, too. I was the Rebel.

I was the Rebel. I was the Rebel.

The fluorescent lights above flickered, casting an eerie glow over the empty room. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and worn leather. But I didn't notice. I was too busy feeling the power of the Rebel, the power of the "not yet."

I was the Rebel. I was the Rebel.

The words echoed in my mind, a mantra of defiance, of resistance. I was the Rebel. I was the Rebel.
