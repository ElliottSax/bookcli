Chapter 1: The Scent of Jasmine and Iron

The memory was not her own. It arrived as an invasion, not a recollection. Adrift in the warm, murmuring sea of the Jasmine Court, Elara Vance held a glass of lukewarm champagne as a mere prop. Then the world dissolved into a silent, blinding flash of white—the afterimage of a camera bulb or a close lightning strike.

A scent struck next. A layered, impossible bouquet. First, the sharp, clean crackle of ozone after a storm cut through the room’s cloying perfume-cloud. Beneath it coiled the narcotic sweetness of night-blooming jasmine, woven through with the cold, metallic tang of fresh blood—iron, rich and startling. And finally, anchoring it all, a whisper of something ancient and dusty: asafoetida. The devil’s dung. A medicinal spice from the Dockside Districts, foul on its own, but here it formed the dark heart of the bouquet.

Her knees buckled. Fingers gripping the edge of a gilded console table, her knuckles bleached white against the lacquered black wood. The Jasmine Court’s cacophony—the jazz quartet’s brassy wail, the clink of crystal, laughter like breaking glass—receded into a dull roar. In its place, a silent, sensory memory unfolded behind her eyes: A man’s hand, large and pale, gripped a jade paperweight, veins standing out like ropes. Terrible, focused rage, cold as river silt. The paperweight rose, then fell—not onto paper, but onto something that gave way with a sickening, wet crunch. That terrible, beautiful scent bloomed in the aftermath.

A gasp dragged the tainted air of the present into her lungs. The episode lasted three seconds. A synaptic ghost. But it left a film of sweat on her upper lip, a tremor in her diaphragm, and the phantom taste of copper on her tongue.

“Elara? Darling, you’ve gone positively sepulchral. Is the champagne off?”

Marlowe Thorne materialized at her elbow, his concern as meticulously tailored as his tuxedo. His face, usually a charming map of easy smiles and crow’s feet, pinched tight. Her employer, the owner of Thorne & Co., Perfumers to the Discerning, and her reluctant guardian in this city of masks.

“A draft,” she managed, her voice thin. “Just a sudden draft.” Explaining her condition invited a diagnosis—hysteric, neurasthenic, unbalanced—and in the Rain-Washed City, a label was a sentence. She called it a heightened olfactory sense, a perfumer’s gift. A half-truth. Her gift was a broken thing. Scents didn’t just evoke memories; they smuggled in sensations, emotions, images belonging to others. A scrambled line between perception and recollection, a synesthesia of the past. This brokenness allowed her to reconstruct a lost fragrance from a client’s childhood description, and at times like this, threatened to unravel her mind.

“This room is a morgue with an orchestra,” Marlowe muttered, scanning the crowd. “Look at them. Vultures circling a corpse that hasn’t even cooled.”

He wasn’t wrong. The Jasmine Court was a masterpiece of desperate glamour. Crystal chandeliers dripped light onto the last dregs of empire: British taipans with faces like boiled hams; French officials sporting impeccable, disdainful mustaches; White Russian princesses serving canapés with trembling hands, their jewels long since pawned. Chinese waiters in immaculate white jackets moved like silent ghosts through the throng, faces impassive, eyes missing nothing. Thick air carried French perfume, Cuban tobacco, Dutch gin, and beneath it all, the sweet, fungal scent of decay. The Rain-Washed City, 1926, was a party in a burning house, and everyone was determined to be the last to smell the smoke.

Tonight’s charity gala for the International Settlement’s police force was a transparent bid for goodwill by the various foreign powers ruling their enclaves like jealous kings. Across the room stood the guest of honour, Sir Arthur Pembroke—a pillar of grey suiting and greyer disposition holding court with a cluster of anxious-looking men. A British diplomat newly arrived from London, he carried a whispered mandate to “steady the ship.”

“Pembroke’s the corpse they’re circling,” Marlowe said, lowering his voice. “London’s losing its nerve. The Kuomintang marches north, the communists stir in the workers’ districts, and all these fools can do is argue over treaty privileges while the walls shake.” He took a sharp swallow of his drink. “We’re perfuming a corpse, Elara. A very lucrative corpse.”

His words barely registered. The ghost-scent—ozone, jasmine, iron, asafoetida—lingered in her sinuses, a haunting refrain. Fading now, mingling with the room’s other odours, its trail remained distinct. It had come from the east side of the Court, near the arched entrance to the hotel’s private salons and conservatories.

“I need air, Marlowe. The terrace.”

“Don’t wander far,” he said, his eyes already tracking a potential client. “And for God’s sake, don’t talk politics.”

She moved not towards the grand French doors to the terrace, but east, following the dissipating ribbon of memory. An impulse, a compulsion she knew was unwise. The memories were rarely literal; they were emotional imprints, sensory echoes. But this one held such violence, such specificity. And the scent… it was a formulation. Deliberate. No one naturally smelled of ozone and blood and devil’s dung.

Slipping through the arched doorway left the jazz and glare behind. Cooler air in the corridor carried beeswax polish and the faint, dry aroma of potted orchids. Deep crimson carpet muffled her steps under the glow of sconces with frosted glass shades.

And there, just a trace—the scent. Fainter, but unmistakable. It led away from the public spaces, down a narrower passage lined with dark wood and doors of frosted glass, each bearing a name in elegant script: The Peony Room, The Lotus Salon. At the end of the hall, a door stood slightly ajar. No light came from within.

This was the source. The scent pooled here, a stagnant, invisible cloud. Elara’s heart began to hammer, a frantic drum against her ribs.n a slow, heavy drum against her ribs. The memory of the raised paperweight flashed again. This is foolish, a clear voice in her head insisted. Turn around. Go back to the champagne and the lies. Her hand, moving as if detached from her will, pushed the door open. The room was a small, luxurious salon, lit only by the milky moonlight filtering through a large window overlooking the hotel’s private gardens. It was a tableau of shadow and silver. A sofa, a low table, a decanter of brandy catching a sliver of light. And on the floor, between the sofa and the table, a shape. Sir Arthur Pembroke lay on his back, his grey eyes open and reflecting the empty moon. His formal shirt was a dark blossom of crimson, centred around the ornate handle of a letter opener buried to the hilt just below his sternum. One hand was flung out, as if reaching for the toppled brandy snifter that lay, unbroken, a few inches from his fingertips. The coppery smell of blood was now a physical presence, thick and warm, mingling with the room’s residual notes of his bay rum cologne, fine leather, and the now-overpowering signature of the killer: ozone, jasmine, iron, asafoetida. Elara did not scream. A strange, cold stillness settled over her. It was the same stillness that followed one of her scent-memories—a disconnect, a sense of observing a scene already painted. She took a step closer, her satin shoes silent on the Persian rug. Her perfumer’s mind, even in shock, began its automatic work. Top notes: ozone (recent, electrical), jasmine sambac (from the garden outside, but intensified, crushed). Heart notes: ferric oxide, human blood, Type O, a recent meal of lamb and red wine. Base notes: asafoetida resin, faint traces of lanolin from wool, a high-quality shoe polish. The killer had stood here, recently. They had been close. They had left their olfactory signature as clearly as a fingerprint. A floorboard creaked behind her. Elara whirled. Two figures filled the doorway, silhouetted by the light from the hall. The first was a European man, thick-set, with a policeman’s bearing despite his evening wear. His eyes, small and shrewd, went from her face to the body on the floor and back again, hardening. The second was Lin, the manager of the Jasmine Court. He was Shanghainese, perhaps in his late forties, immaculate in a traditional changshan of dark silk. His expression was not one of shock, but of profound, weary resignation. His gaze, however, was like a physical pressure. It took in Elara, the body, the spatial relationship between them, and calculated the infinite trouble this represented. “Mademoiselle,” the European said, his French accent clipped. “Step away from there, if you please.” He did not say “the body.” He did not need to. “I… I just found him,” Elara heard herself say, her voice echoing strangely in her own head. Lin moved past the inspector, his movements fluid and silent. He did not look at Pembroke again. Instead, he went to the window, checked the latch, then surveyed the room with a proprietorial air. “This is the Chrysanthemum Salon,” he said, as if identifying a rare specimen. “It was reserved for Sir Arthur’s private use this evening.” The Frenchman, Inspector Valois, Elara presumed, guided her firmly by the elbow away from the body and towards the sofa. He did not make her sit. “Your name, Mademoiselle?” “Elara Vance. I am a perfumer. With Thorne and Company. I was a guest at the gala.” “And what are you doing in a private salon, Mademoiselle Vance?” “I felt faint. I was looking for a quiet room.” The lie came automatically. To speak of the scent was impossible. Valois’s eyes were on her hands. “You have no weapon.” It wasn’t a question. Lin, from his place by the window, spoke softly. “The letter opener is from the hotel’s writing desk set. In every salon.” Valois ignored him, his focus entirely on Elara. “Did you see anyone? Hear anything?” She shook her head. The memory-flash of the hand, the paperweight, seared behind her eyes. Not a paperweight. A letter opener. “No. No one.” “The door was open?” “Ajar.” Valois knelt by the body, careful not to disturb anything. He did not touch the letter opener. He studied Pembroke’s face, the position of his limbs. “He has been dead perhaps twenty minutes. No sign of a struggle. He knew his killer, or was taken by surprise.” He looked up at Elara. “And you, Mademoiselle, you just… stumbled upon this scene.” “Yes.” Lin cleared his throat. “Inspector, perhaps Mademoiselle Vance should wait in my office. This is a shock. The guests must not be alarmed prematurely.” Valois stood, brushing his knees. He understood the politics. A scandal, a panic, was worse than a murder for the powers that ruled the Settlement. “Yes. A good idea. Mademoiselle, you will accompany Mr. Lin. I will join you shortly. Do not speak to anyone.” As Lin led her from the room, Elara glanced back. In the moonlight, a detail she had missed: a single, crushed blossom of night-blooming jasmine lay on the floor near Pembroke’s outstretched hand. It had not been there in her memory-flash. It was real. Lin’s office was a study in serene control, a world away from the opulent decay of the The Jasmine Court. It was spare, dominated by a large desk of polished elm, shelves of ledgers, and a single scroll painting of misty mountains. The air smelled of sandalwood and green tea. He did not sit behind the desk, but gestured to a chair before it, then took a seat opposite her, his posture erect. “This is a terrible thing, Miss Vance,” he said, his English flawless, only lightly accented. “For the hotel. For the Settlement. For you.” “I didn’t kill him.” “I know.” He said it simply, as a statement of fact. “A woman of your stature, with no motive, using a weapon to hand? It is inelegant. Improbable. The Inspector knows this too. But he must have a story, and you are currently the author of an inconvenient chapter.” “What will happen?” “An investigation. Quiet, at first. Then, when a suitable narrative is found, it will become loud. They will need a culprit. Preferably one who causes the least… diplomatic friction.” The door opened and Inspector Valois entered, followed by a uniformed Chinese officer who took up a position by the door. Valois commandeered Lin’s desk, a deliberate power play to which Lin responded with a barely perceptible incline of his head. “Now, Mademoiselle Vance,” Valois began, placing a small notebook on the desk. “Let us start again. You felt faint. You left the The Jasmine Court. You chose a corridor leading away from the public terraces and gardens. You tried the door to a private salon. Why?” Elara’s mind raced. The scent was fading from her now, the memory becoming dreamlike. She had to give him something, something true enough to be believable, but safe. “A smell,” she said, the words tasting like ash. Valois leaned forward. “A smell?” “I am a perfumer. I have a sensitive nose. I caught a… a peculiar odour in the The Jasmine Court. Unpleasant. It made me feel unwell. I thought its source might be out here, in the quieter air.” “What was this odour?” Here it was. The precipice. She could describe it truthfully. But to do so would be to give voice to the ghost in her mind, to invite the questions she could never answer. Valois would think her mad, or worse, inventive. The killer’s scent-formula was her only secret, her only piece of the truth. She could not surrender it. She had to substitute it. She closed her eyes, as if concentrating. The components of the The Jasmine Court’s olfactory soup swirled: French perfume, cigar smoke, gin, sweat, the faint sewage tang of the Huangpu River carried on the night breeze. She needed a dominant, memorable scent. A person. An image came: a broad American in a slightly too-tight tuxedo, his laugh booming over the jazz earlier. He’d brushed past her, trailing a cloud of expensive Macassar oil, Cuban tobacco, and the distinct, sweet-pungent aroma of his own product—Virginia Gold Leaf cigarettes. A scent of arrogance and empire. He’d been arguing with Pembroke near the champagne fountain, his face flushed with more than drink. “It was… a mix of things,” Elara said, opening her eyes. They landed on Valois’s notebook, blank and waiting. “Strong tobacco. Bay rum. And something else, sharp, like… hair tonic. It was very strong. It made my head ache.” Valois’s pen scratched. “Can you be more specific? Many men smoke. Many wear bay rum.” She let a note of impatience, of frayed nerves, into her voice. “It was particular. The tobacco was Virginian, not Turkish or Chinese. The hair tonic was of a cheap, chemical variety. It clashed.” She was The cold knot in her stomach turned to ice. She had done it. She had named a name, redirecting the hunt toward a powerful, dangerous man. Valois’s satisfied nod felt like a sentence.

As the implications settled, a new scent reached her, cutting through the sandalwood and her own fear. It was faint, emanating from the air vent near the ceiling. That familiar, complex bouquet—ozone, jasmine, iron, asafoetida—but now underscored by a new, chilling note: the clean, sterile scent of lye soap.

The killer had washed their hands.

They were still in the hotel. They had heard the commotion, knew the investigation had begun. And the soap… it wasn’t the gentle lavender soap from the guest bathrooms. It was the harsh, industrial compound used only by the kitchen staff and the housekeeping laundry. The killer wasn’t a guest hiding in plain sight. They were part of the machinery of the place, invisible.

The scent began to fade, withdrawing from the vent as silently as it had come. But a final, almost imperceptible thread lingered—a faint trace of satisfaction, of sharp amusement, as clear to her as a whisper in the dark. They weren’t just listening. They were evaluating. They knew she had lied.

And the message in that fading signature was terrifyingly clear: I am here. I know you. This is between us now.
