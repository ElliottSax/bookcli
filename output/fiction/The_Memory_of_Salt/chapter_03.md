Chapter 3: A Trail of Opium and Orange Blossom

Rain had transformed The Rain-Washed City into a smeared watercolour, grey bleeding into the Whangpoo’s grey as the grand edifices of the Bund dissolved into a monochrome haze. Inside her small apartment above a tea merchant’s shop, the blank page of Elara Vance’s scent journal offered no solace. That brutal, beautiful imprint was already degrading—the curse of her condition. The more she tried to hold a scent-memory still, the faster its notes evaporated, leaving only the emotional residue of terror and awe, and a handful of crumbling details.
It had to be fixed. Now.
With closed eyes, she let the hotel room reconstitute around her. Not the blood, not the body—those were pushed aside. She sought the air. First, the top notes: crisp, starched-linen from the hotel laundry, undercut with a waxy, honeyed note from beeswax candles. Then, the heart: the ghost of the diplomat’s cologne, a dull, expensive sandalwood. And there, woven through it all, the killer’s scent. The one that didn’t belong.
Her pen scratch frantically across the page.
*Top: Orange blossom. Not the crude neroli of the markets, but refined, almost candied. French. A touch of aldehydes—sparkling, like champagne bubbles.*
*Heart: Opium. Not the raw, vegetal poppy, but the smoked residue. A sweet, resinous haze, like incense in a decadent temple. High-grade. Blended with something… vanillic, balsamic.*
*Base: Ambergris. The true, aged ambergris, warm, animalic, sea-salty. And… salt. Not the scent, but the memory of salt. A hollow, metallic tang on the tongue.*

Opening her eyes revealed the words as inadequate, mere signposts for a landscape only her mind could navigate. But they were all she had to give Valois.
Stale tobacco, damp wool, and bureaucratic despair saturated Chief Inspector Valois’s office at the Central Police Station. He listened to her recitation behind a mask of strained patience, tapping the end of his fountain pen against a stack of reports after she finished.
“Orange blossom. Opium. Ambergris,” he repeated, his French accent clipping the words. “A poetic inventory, Mademoiselle Vance. Yesterday, in the heat of the moment, you were certain you smelled gun oil and Russian leather. A ‘military’ scent, you said. That pointed us toward Colonel Derbin.”

Heat flooded Elara’s cheeks. “The memory… it clarifies with time. The initial shock—”

“The initial shock produced a convenient suspect who happens to be my political rival.” Valois interrupted, not unkindly, but with a weary finality. “Now it clarifies into something else. Something more… exotic.” Leaning forward, he fixed her with eyes like chips of flint. “Your testimony is a compass that points in a new direction every hour. A court would tear you to pieces. I am tempted to tear you to pieces.”

“It is the truth as I perceive it.” Her voice emerged small but stubborn.
“Perfume is not truth. It is illusion.” A sigh escaped him as he massaged his temple. “But the orange blossom… that is specific. There is a woman. Madame Celeste Auclair. A French widow of considerable means and considerable mystery. She is known for a signature perfume. A custom creation from Grasse. It is said to feature orange blossom.”

A name. A face to attach to the scent. Blood thrummed in Elara’s ears, a sudden, insistent rhythm.
“You will go to the perfume markets,” Valois decided. “Reconstruct this scent of yours, note by note. Find me something tangible—a bottle, an ingredient, a supplier. Bring me proof that this memory of yours has any connection to the material world.” His look pinned her to the chair. “Do not return with only poetry.”

A labyrinth of sensory overload, the perfume district existed a world away from the grand boulevards. Nestled behind the Bubbling Well Road, its narrow alleys formed canyons of sacks brimming with dried jasmine, rose petals, and vetiver roots. The air thickened into soup: the camphorous shout of eucalyptus battled the sweet, decaying whisper of tuberose, the clean, sharp slash of peppermint cutting through the woolly fog of sandalwood shavings.
Elara moved through the chaos with a perfumer’s focus, a hunter on a scent trail. She found the orange blossom first—the real thing, not the synthetic. At a tiny stall run by a wizened Fujianese woman, she sampled several. Most were flat, a little green. Then she found it: a tiny vial of neroli pétale, absurdly expensive, imported from the south of France. Exactly the note from her memory—candied, sparkling, impossibly refined. The widow confirmed only two customers in The Rain-Washed City bought it with any regularity: the Perfumery of the Celestial Dragon on Nanking Road, and a private client, a French lady in the French Concession.
Next, the ambergris. This was rarer, a treasure of the scent world. Discreet inquiries at three merchants led to an Armenian trader, his fingers stained yellow with saffron. He nodded. “The true ambergris, the aged grey, from the belly of the sperm whale? Only one man in The Rain-Washed City has a reliable supply. Feodor. The Russian. His shop is at the end of the alley, where the cats sleep.”

Feodor’s apothecary was a cave of curiosities. Jars of murky liquids held coiled snakes and unidentifiable organs. Bundles of dried herbs hung from the low beams, layering the air with the dust of centuries and the bite of alcohol. Feodor himself was a bear of a man with a magnificent white beard and eyes of startling, watery blue.
“Ambergris,” he boomed, his Russian accent rolling like thunder. “For a lady? You seek to make a love potion?” His laugh shook the jars.
“For a reconstruction.” Elara explained her need, omitting the murder. She spoke of a lost perfume, a forgotten masterpiece.
Feodor listened, his joviality fading into a keen, intelligent scrutiny. He produced a tiny lacquered box. Inside, on a bed of velvet, lay a nugget of grey-white ambergris, waxy, veined, smelling profound.undly of the sea, of sun-bleached driftwood, and of something intimately animal. It was perfect. As he wrapped a sliver for her, he spoke casually.
“The orange blossom, the ambergris… these are the clothes of a scent, da? But the heart you describe, this opium haze… that is its soul. And its soul is dangerous.”

Elara stilled. “Dangerous?”

“The opium note is not mere poppy tincture,” Feodor replied, lowering his voice. “It is a specific accord. A sweet, smoky benzoin and vanilla blend, cut with a particular resin from the Golden Triangle. It is the signature of a product called ‘White Dragon.’ Very high grade. Very exclusive.” His blue eyes held hers. “It is the preferred smoke of the Lóngshé Liánméng—the Dragon-Snake Consortium. They control the refined trade. Not the street slop. The kind that soothes the pains of emperors and taipans.”

A chill, unrelated to the damp of the shop, crept down Elara’s spine. “A trading consortium?”

“A power,” Feodor corrected softly. “They have no flag, no office. But they are in the tea, the silk, the silver… and the smoke. To smell of ‘White Dragon’ is not to be a user, devushka. It is to be a part of the mechanism. Or to be marked by it.” He pushed the packet of ambergris across the counter. “Your lost perfume is not lost. It is a banner. Be careful upon whose breeze you smell it.”

Elara paid him, her fingers trembling slightly. As she left the dim shop, stepping back into the noisy alley, the weight of his warning settled on her. She had come seeking components and found a conspiracy.
And then she saw him.
Across the alley, partially obscured by a cart piled high with sacks of dried lavender, stood a Chinese man in an immaculate grey Western suit. He was utterly still, reading a newspaper, his face impassive. He was unremarkable in every way, which was why she noticed him. She had seen him an hour ago near the orange blossom stall. And before that, lingering near the entrance to the district. He never looked directly at her, but his presence was a constant, silent pressure at the edge of her vision.
Paranoia, once a seed, now unfurled dark, leafy tendrils in her mind. Was he Valois’s man, ensuring she didn’t fabricate evidence? Or did he belong to the Dragon-Snake Consortium? She quickened her pace, diving into a narrower side-alley, her heart hammering against her ribs. She ducked into a doorway, pressing herself into the shadows, and waited. A minute passed. Two. Then, the soft, deliberate sound of leather soles on wet stone approached, paused, and continued on. She peered out. The alley was empty. But the silence he left behind was now a presence in itself.
Madame Celeste Auclair resided in a pristine white villa in the heart of the French Concession, a bastion of wilful normality amidst The Rain-Washed City (unnamed)’s frenzy. Wrought-iron balconies dripped with pink geraniums, and the air smelled of freshly baked bread and coffee. From her vantage point behind a lace curtain in a café patisserie across the street, Elara watched.
She appeared at noon, descending the steps of her villa. She was a silhouette of effortless elegance: a dress of dove-grey silk, a hat with a modest veil, a parasol resting on her shoulder. Even from a distance, she moved with a hypnotic, fluid grace. As she passed the café, a gust of wind carried her scent across the street.
It struck Elara like a physical blow.
There it was—the top note. The sparkling, candied orange blossom, exactly as in her memory. It was unmistakable. The rest—the opium, the ambergris—was masked by the distance and the street smells, but the heart of the perfume, its calling card, was confirmed. This was the woman who had stood over the diplomat’s body. The scent-memory had not lied.
Elara followed at a distance, a ghost in the midday crowd. Madame Auclair did not shop. She did not socialize. She walked with a purpose that seemed both casual and utterly determined, finally entering the secluded public garden of the former Mandarin’s palace. It was a world of manicured silence, of koi ponds and weeping willows, of arched bridges and pavilions with names like “Pavilion of the Whispering Breeze.” The city’s roar faded to a murmur.
Elara hid behind a screen of bamboo, watching as Madame Auclair paused by a lotus pond, seemingly absorbed in the crimson flowers. The glamour was intact, but up close, Elara saw the cracks. The hand on the parasol handle was clenched, the knuckles white. The set of the shoulders was not just elegant, but rigid, as if bearing an invisible weight. This was not the posture of a careless socialite, but of a woman holding herself together by a thread.
She must have made a sound—a caught breath, the rustle of silk. Or perhaps Madame Auclair had known she was there all along.
Without turning, the Frenchwoman spoke, her voice low, melodic, and laced with a fatigue that seemed centuries old.
“The perfume markets are so vulgar in the afternoon, are they not? All that shouting. One longs for the silence of a garden.”

Elara froze, blood turning to ice in her veins.
Madame Auclair finally turned. Her face, seen clearly through the delicate veil, was beautiful in a way that was almost painful—fine-boned, pale, with eyes of a profound, liquid darkness. There was no hostility in her gaze. Only a deep, resonant sorrow, and a flicker of recognition.
“You are the perfumer,” she stated. “The one with the… sensitive nose. I heard about the incident at the Jasmine Court.”

Elara found her voice, though it was a dry whisper. “You were there.”

A faint, sad smile touched Madame Auclair’s lips. “Many people were there. It was a party.” She took a step closer. The scent intensified, wrapping around Elara: the orange blossom, and now, beneath it, the sweet, smoky opium haze, and the deep, saline ambergris. It was the full symphony. It was the scent of the crime. “You have been following a trail of scent. A dangerous hobby. Like following a ghost.”

“You left a ghost in that room,” Elara said, courage flaring. “A ghost of orange blossom and opium.”

Madame Auclair’s composure didn’t break. She merely nodded, as if acknowledging a minor social gaffe. “I did. But I did not leave the body.” She looked directly into Elara’s eyes, and her own were pools of sheer, unvarnished terror. “You must believe me. I found him. Just as you did. A moment before. The scent you remember… it is mine. It is my signature, my armour, my curse. It places me at the scene. It is meant to.”

Elara’s mind reeled. “Meant to?”

“We are both pawns, Mademoiselle Vance,” Madame Aucla answered, her voice dropping to a urgent whisper. She glanced around the empty garden, the paranoia infectious. “You, with your memories that shift like sand. Me, with my perfume that marks me like a brand. We are tools in a game we do not understand.” She reached into the small beaded bag at her wrist and withdrew not a weapon, but a single, folded square of rice paper. She pressed it into Elara’s numb hand. “The scent you seek, the true scent of the act, not simply the people in the room… it has a name. They call it ‘The Memory of Salt.’ Ask your Inspector Valois about it. If he is honest, he will pale.”

“Who are ‘they’?” Elara managed to ask.
Before Madame Auclair could answer, a flicker of movement at the garden’s moon gate caught Elara’s eye. A figure in a grey suit stood silhouetted against the light. The silent Chinese man. He did not enter. He simply watched.
Madame Auclair followed her gaze. Her face, already pale, went ashen. The fear in her eyes solidified into something like resignation.
“They are everywhere,” she breathed. “Forget the orange blossom. Follow the salt.”

She turned and walked away, her grey silk dress whispering against the gravel path, her scent lingering in the humid air—a beautiful, tragic banner. She did not look back. The man in the grey suit watched her go, then his impassive eyes shifted to Elara, holding her for one interminable second before he, too, melted away into the shadows of the archway.
Alone in the whispering garden, with the scent of lotus and betrayal thick in the air, Elara unfolded the rice paper. Inside was a tiny, crystalline flake. She brought it to her nose.
It was salt. But not just salt. It carried the faint, electric, hollow tang of a specific memory—the base note of her vision, the metallic taste on her tongue in the hotel room. It was the scent of a void, of absence, of a tear in the fabric of things.
The Memory of Salt.
In her hand, the crystal less like a clue and more like the first sharp spill of sand in an hourglass, measuring out a time that was rapidly running out.
