  "plot_summary": "The book dismantles the romanticized 'Myth of the Chaotic Genius' leader through the opening story of Michael Thorne's breakdown. It then introduces seven counter-examples\u2014leaders who built empires not from frenzy, but from cultivated focus. The core narrative is the reader's own transformation, guided through a four-phase protocol: 1) **Awareness & Audit** (mapping personal chaos triggers), 2) **Design** (creating a single, stupidly simple mindful protocol), 3) **Deployment & Discipline** (executing with surgical precision to build self-trust), and 4) **Integration & Scaling** (systematically building an internal infrastructure of calm). The journey moves from external reaction to internal command, arguing that the ultimate competitive advantage is a mind that can be quieted and directed at will."
