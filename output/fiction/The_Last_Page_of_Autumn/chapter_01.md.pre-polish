Chapter 1: The Inheritance of Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist Chapter 1: The Inheritance of Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist The news of Elara Bell Bell’s death arrived on a Tuesday, wrapped in the sterile scent of office toner and the distant wail of city sirens. Harper Lin Lin, her shoulders permanently hunched from a decade of peering at crumbling municipal records, held the lawyer’s letter as if it might disintegrate. Peaceful, the letter said. In her sleep. At home. Harper Lin tried to picture it. Her aunt’s home was a hazy memory of gables and the smell of old paper and cinnamon, a place visited only once, a lifetime ago, when her mother was still alive. A place called Amberwood. A week later, Harper Lin’s rented car crunched over a carpet of fallen leaves on a winding Vermont road. The city’s constant gray had given way to a breathtaking, almost violent, symphony of color. Maples burned crimson and gold, oaks held up bronze crowns, and the air itself tasted of woodsmoke and damp, sweet decay. It was a sensory overload that made her archival instincts itch—preserve this, catalogue this—but the beauty was too vast, too fleeting, to file away. Amberwood revealed itself slowly: a cluster of clapboard houses painted in faded, cheerful colors, a white-steepled church, a general store with pumpkins crowding its porch. It was postcard-perfect, yet it felt alive, not staged. People moved with a slower rhythm, their greetings hanging in the crisp air like visible breath. “Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist,” the lawyer, Mr. Mr. Finch, had said over a crackling phone line. “That’s Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist. That’s what she’s left you. The whole building, contents, and… well, the contents.” He’d made it sound simple. A signature, a sale, a return to the sensible grid of her life. But as Harper Lin pulled up to the curb on Maple Street, her hands tightened on the wheel. The bookshop sat between a tailor’s called ‘Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist’ and a boarded-up antique store. It was a three-story Victorian, its gingerbread trim a little lopsided, its plum-colored paint peeling like sunburnt skin. A hanging sign, shaped like an open book, creaked on iron hinges. Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist, it proclaimed in faded gilt letters. Beneath, in smaller script: Proprietor: Elara Bell Bell. The large display window was a still-life of autumn: a pyramid of books with russet covers, a ceramic mug holding a bouquet of dried wheat and bittersweet, and a single, perfect, orange-gold maple leaf placed deliberately in the center of the sill. Behind the glass, the interior was a deep, inviting gloom. The bell above the tailor’s door jingled, and a man with kind eyes and a tape measure around his neck gave her a small, sympathetic wave. Harper Lin managed a nod before turning to Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist door. Her key—an old, heavy skeleton key—turned with a satisfying clunk. The smell hit her first. It was the scent of her one childhood visit, now given a name: old paper, yes, and cinnamon, but also beeswax, dust, and the faint, cold scent of ash from a long-dead fire. She stepped inside, the floorboards groaning a welcome, or a warning. Chaos. But a soft, literary chaos. Books were not just on shelves; they spilled from chairs, rose in teetering stacks like miniature cities, filled a wheelbarrow parked by a cold, brick fireplace. A ladder on rails stretched to the high ceiling, where more shelves loomed. A cash register, an antique brass behemoth, sat on a polished oak counter. Behind it, a wall of cubbyholes held letters and small parcels, each labeled with a name in elegant script. For Mr. Vance, For Miss Lydia, For the Miller Boy. It wasn’t just a shop; it was a post office, a community hub. Or it had been. The warmth was gone, replaced by a chill that seeped from the walls. But the ghost of it remained, in the well-worn path in the rug, in the two armchairs angled toward the hearth, in the child-sized stool tucked under a low shelf labeled ‘Dragon Country.’ Harper Lin’s archivist soul recoiled at the disorder, but her deeper, wearier self felt an unexpected pang. This place had been loved. “Miss Lin?” She started. A man stood in the open doorway, backlit by the afternoon sun. He was in his late sixties, dressed in a tweed suit that had gone soft at the elbows, and he carried a battered leather satchel. “Mr. Mr. Finch?” “The same.” He stepped in, removing his hat to reveal a head of close-cropped silver hair. His handshake was firm, his eyes a sharp, assessing blue. “The drive was well?” “It was… beautiful.” “It is that. Especially now. Elara Bell’s favorite season.” He looked around, his gaze softening. “She’d let the place go a bit, these last few years. Became more reclusive. But the town still came. Left notes in the cubbies, took books, left payment on the honor system. It was a peculiar institution.” He moved to the counter, opening his satchel. “The paperwork is straightforward. The building, the business, all contents are yours. There are no debts to speak of, aside from the general upkeep, which is… considerable.” He laid out documents. “You can sell, of course. The building alone, the location… there’s interest. A developer from Burlington has made inquiries. Wants to turn it into a ‘rustic-chic espresso bar.’” He said the last words with palpable distaste. Harper Lin’s eyes traveled over the cubbyholes, the ladder, the wheelbarrow of books. “Did she… did she have many friends?” “Elara Bell was a mystery,” Mr. Finch said, stamping a document with more force than necessary. “A beloved mystery. She knew everyone’s business—people told her things, in letters, in notes left with their book orders. She was a listener. But she shared little of herself. She had her routines. Tea at the Hearth Café every Tuesday. A walk in the woods every morning, regardless of weather. And this.” He gestured to Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist. “This was her life.” He handed her a large, brass keyring. “Front door, back door, her private rooms upstairs. And this.” From his inner pocket, he drew not a document, but a book. It was small, hand-bound in worn, chestnut-brown leather, with no title on its spine. “She was explicit. This was to be given to you, personally, after the formalities. Her journal, of a sort. She said you’d understand.” Harper Lin took it. The leather was supple, warm from Mr. Finch’s pocket. It felt alive. “I’ll leave you to it,” he said, gathering his things. “My number is on the documents. Take your time. The town doesn’t bite. Mostly.” At the door, he paused. “She wasn’t afraid of death, your aunt. But she was… concerned about something, these last few months. Jumpy. More so than usual. I put it down to age.” He touched his hat brim. “Welcome to Amberwood, Miss Lin.” The silence after he left was profound. It was the silence of a stopped clock, of held breath. Harper Lin stood in the middle of Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist, the journal in one hand, the cold keys in the other. She spent the next hours in a daze of exploration. The back room was a labyrinth of more books, a dusty desk, and a small kitchenette with a perpetually dripping tap. A narrow staircase led to Elara Bell Bell’s apartment. It was a time capsule. A small sitting room with a velvet settee, a bedroom with a four-poster bed made up with a faded quilt, a tiny kitchen. It was neat, sparse, but everywhere there were signs of a singular mind: a collection of bird feathers arranged by color on the windowsill, a map of the stars pinned to the wall with annotations in a tight, looping script, a shelf containing only books about ferns. It was lonely, but it was not sad. It was a life deliberately, curiously lived. Harper Lin made a cup of tea in the small kitchen, the ritual calming her. As dusk painted the sky indigo and peach, she settled into one of the armchairs by the cold fireplace downstairs. She switched on a Tiffany-style lamp, which cast a pool of jeweled light, and finally opened the leather journal. The first page held not writing, but a pressed leaf—a sugar maple, its color a vibrant, preserved scarlet. It was so perfectly placed it seemed a part of the book itself. Beneath it, in the same elegant script she’d seen on the cubbyholes, was an inscription: For the final reader. A shiver, not entirely unpleasant, traced Harper Lin’s spine. She turned the page. The entries were not dated. They were observations, fragments, lists. Crows gathering in the eastern pine. 23 today. They remember him. Mrs. Vance’s arthritis is worse. Left her the comfrey salve and a novel about Paris. She needs the distraction. The moss on the north side of the Gable Stone is growing faster. It shouldn’t. Ordered more peppermint. The Miller boy has nightmares. It was a chronicle of the town, a weave of the mundane and the slightly odd. Harper Lin read on, captivated. Her aunt saw patterns in everything—in weather, in animal behavior, in the frequency of her neighbors’ visits. The prose was lyrical, sharp. The first frost came last night, painting every leaf silver. The world held its breath. I found his footprint by the creek again. Fainter this time. Fading. Whose footprint? Harper Lin wondered. She made another cup of tea as full darkness fell, wrapping herself in a quilt she’d brought down from upstairs. The shop around her felt different at night. The shadows in the corners deepened. The groans of the old house sounded like sighs. She kept reading. The entries grew more urgent, less about the town and more about the woods surrounding it. The path behind the Gable Stone is wrong. The birch trees are in a different order. Someone is rearranging the scenery. He doesn’t want it found. But it wants to be found. It’s getting impatient. Harper Lin’s professional skepticism warred with a growing, visceral unease. Her aunt’s tone wasn’t mad; it was terrified and utterly convinced. She was halfway through the journal, her eyes straining in the lamplight, when she decided to skim a few more pages before seeking the cold, unfamiliar bed upstairs. She flipped a cluster of pages, her gaze drifting idly down the lines. And then she stopped. Her breath caught. It wasn’t the words themselves, though they were strange enough (“The price of memory is paid in autumn gold,” “The door in the ravine only opens when the moon forgets its name”). It was their first letters. She had been an archivist too long not to see patterns in text. Her eye, trained to spot discrepancies in century-old handwriting, automatically aligned the capitals. On this page, the first entries of the day began: The final word—her own name, Elara Bell—sent a jolt of ice through her veins. This was no random musing. This was a code. A message for the “final reader.”

Harper Lin slammed the book shut. The sound was swallowed by a new, profound silence. The wind outside had died mid-moan. The shop held its breath.

In that vacuum, a soft, distinct sound echoed from the back room—the clear, metallic click of the deadbolt on the rear door sliding open. A door she had locked herself hours ago.

Her blood turned to stone. She wasn't alone.

The journal fell from her numb hands, splaying open on the floor. There, on the newly revealed page, was a rough sketch of Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist’s interior, her own chair circled in frantic ink. Scrawled beneath it, in the same hand as the warnings, was a fresh line that hadn’t been there a moment before: Too late, Elara Bell. The reader is read.

A floorboard creaked in the hallway. Harper Lin froze, her eyes locked on the dark archway leading to the back. The scent of damp earth and decaying paper, a scent that had not been there before, crept into the air.

Her aunt’s peaceful death wasn’t the first sentence. It was the decoy. And the mystery, she realized as a shadow detached itself from the deeper darkness of the hall, was already reading her.
