Chapter 5: Beneath the Bridge

The threat, slipped under Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist door like a shard of ice, should have stopped them. It was a single line, typed on brittle, yellowing paper that smelled faintly of mildew and something metallic, like old pennies: Some stories are best left unread. But the note had the opposite effect. It made the mystery solid, gave it teeth. It confirmed they were not chasing ghosts, but something—or someone—that was still very much alive and watching.

“It’s a bluff,” Leo Bianchi said, his voice tighter than usual as they stood in the amber glow of Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist’s backroom. He held the paper by its corner. “A scare tactic from someone who doesn’t want us poking around the town’s dusty skeleton closet.”

Harper Lin traced the embossed cover of Elara Bell’s journal, feeling the familiar grooves of the tree. “Or it’s a warning from someone who knows exactly what’s in that closet, and is afraid of the draft.”

She walked over to the large, wooden desk in the center of the room, where a single, flickering candle cast eerie shadows on the walls. The flame danced, casting a hypnotic spell, as she examined the journal more closely. The pages were yellowed, the ink faded, but the words still seemed to leap off the page. She felt� a shiver run down her spine as she read the entry from the night before.

“Tonight, I went to the old bridge,” Elara Bell had written. “I felt the weight of the past bearing down on me. The river’s song is hushed by timber, and the town’s first mile is measured. I know I’m not the only one who feels it. There are others out there, searching for the same thing. I can feel their eyes on me, watching me. I must be careful.”

Harper Lin’s eyes met Leo Bianchi’s, and she knew he was thinking the same thing. They decided to go to the covered bridge at dusk. There was a practical reason—fewer prying eyes—but Harper Lin admitted, if only to herself, that the time of day suited the task. The bridge, a century-old relic of timber and shadow named “The Whispering Pass,” was a place of creaks and echoes in full daylight. At twilight, it became a living thing, a throat of old wood swallowing the fading light.

The air was crisp, carrying the sweet-rot scent of fallen leaves and the damp, mineral breath of the Stonebrook River below. The bridge’s red paint, faded to the color of dried blood, seemed to absorb the last of the day’s light. As they stepped inside, the world changed. The gentle rush of water became a muffled drone, and their footsteps on the plank floor echoed like cautious heartbeats. Slivers of violet sky gleamed through gaps in the siding.

“First mile is measured,” Leo Bianchi whispered, playing his flashlight beam over a weathered plaque commemorating the bridge’s role as the old town boundary. “This is it. North-facing truss.”

The interior was a cathedral of cobwebs and dust motes dancing in their flashlight beams. They moved slowly, examining the massive, hand-hewn beams that curved overhead. Harper Lin ran her fingers over the timber, feeling the rough grain, the cold heads of square-cut nails, the carved initials of generations. She was looking for an “eye.” A knot? A hole?

“Harper Lin,” Leo Bianchi called softly. He was standing before a particularly stout vertical beam. At head height, a large, knotted imperfection in the wood looked like a dark, whorled pupil. “North-facing,” he confirmed, checking his phone’s compass.

Harper Lin pressed her fingers around the knot. It was loose. With a careful twist that sent a shower of ancient wood dust onto her sleeve, the entire knot came away in her hand, revealing a deep, cylindrical hollow. Her breath caught. Leo Bianchi’s flashlight beam plunged into the hole, illuminating not empty darkness, but the corroded corner of a metal box.

The box was lodged tight. Leo Bianchi had to use his pocket knife to pry it free, the screech of metal on wood unnaturally loud in the enclosed space. Finally, it slid out, landing in Harper Lin’s waiting hands with a solid, satisfying weight. It was about the size of a large dictionary, made of tin or steel, and rust had bloomed across its surface in orange and brown continents. A simple clasp, frozen shut with corrosion, held its secrets.

Back on the bridge’s walkway, they huddled together. Leo Bianchi worked on the clasp with the tip of his knife and a patience Harper Lin could barely endure. The river murmured below. A distant dog barked. Then, with a gritty snap, the clasp gave way.

The interior was lined with crumbling velvet. Two items lay within, preserved from the worst of the damp. The first was a photograph. Harper Lin lifted it out as if it were a lepidopterist’s specimen. It was a black-and-white picture, its edges soft with age, but the faces were startlingly clear.

Five people stood in front of this very bridge, decades younger, their smiles wide and unguarded. Harper Lin immediately recognized Elara Bell. She couldn’t have been more than twenty, her hair a wild dark cloud, her arm slung casually around the shoulders of a beaming young man with round spectacles—Leo Bianchi’s grandfather, Albert. To Elara Bell’s left was a woman of fierce beauty, with sharp cheekbones and laughing eyes, holding a leather-bound book aloft like a trophy. And on the far right, standing a little apart, her smile more composed but her eyes bright with intellectual fervor, was a young Constance Vance. Harper Lin’s pulse thrummed. The historical society president, with her perfectly coiffed grey hair and tartan skirts, was here, caught in a moment of youthful rebellion.

“The Veridian Quill,” Leo Bianchi breathed, his finger hovering over his grandfather’s face. “In the flesh.”

The second item was several sheets of paper, folded together. The handwriting was different from Elara Bell’s looping script—more precise, angular. It was a manifesto, a record of the society’s grandest, and final, scheme.

October 22nd, 1963, it began. The Last Hunt. Our magnum opus. We five, stewards of the word, have devised not a mere puzzle but a legacy. The ‘Autumn Treasury’ is not gold, nor jewels. It is a collection. First editions, each annotated by the author’s own hand, or bearing the marginalia of a profound reader. Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, Bradbury… volumes where the soul of the writer converses with the page. We have gathered them, through means fair and fervent, to create a time capsule of literary light. It is to be hidden, not hoarded. Its location is a poem, a map of our town’s heart and ours. The finder must be one who understands that the greatest treasure is a conversation across time.

Harper Lin’s eyes devoured the words. A library of living voices, hidden away for decades, waiting to be rediscovered. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she read the final sentence.

“The finder must be one who understands that the greatest treasure is a conversation across time.”

She looked up at Leo Bianchi, her eyes locked on his. They both knew what this meant. They had stumbled upon something much bigger than themselves, something that could change the course of their lives forever.

As they stood there, the darkness closing in around them, Harper Lin felt a sense of wonder and excitement. They had uncovered a secret, a secret that had been hidden for decades. And now, they had the chance to uncover even more.

“Let’s go back to Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist,” Harper Lin said, her voice barely above a whisper. “We have a lot of work to do.”

Leo Bianchi nodded, his eyes shining with excitement. Together, they turned and walked back to Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist, ready to face whatever lay ahead.

As they walked, the darkness seemed to grow thicker, like a living thing. But Harper Lin and Leo Bianchi didn’t notice. They were too busy thinking about the secrets they had uncovered, and the adventures that lay ahead.

The night air was filled with the sound of crickets and the distant hum of a car driving by. But Harper Lin and Leo Bianchi were lost in their own little world, a world of mystery and wonder.

And as they walked, the darkness seemed to grow less thick, like a veil being lifted. They were walking into a new dawn, a dawn of discovery and adventure.

The shop came into view, its lights shining like a light in the darkness. Harper Lin and Leo Bianchi quickened their pace, their hearts pounding with excitement.

They burst through the door, laughing and talking at the same time. They were ready to face whatever lay ahead, ready to uncover the secrets of the Autumn Treasury.

And as they sat down at the desk, surrounded by books and papers, Harper Lin felt a sense of wonder and excitement. They had uncovered a secret, a secret that had been hidden for decades.

But they knew that this was just the beginning. They had a lot of work to do, a lot of secrets to uncover. And they were ready to face whatever lay ahead.
