Chapter 6: A Binding Secret

The scent of autumn was different inside Elara Bell's workshop. Out in the world, it was a perfume of decay and woodsmoke, of crisp apples and damp earth. In here, it was the dry, scholarly smell of old paper, the vegetal tang of wheat-starch paste, the rich, oily aroma of leather, and the faint, metallic whisper of tool steel. It was the smell of things being preserved, given new form, saved from time. Harper Lin breathed it in, feeling it steady her racing mind.
The confrontation at the bridge had left a static in her veins. The returned page, slipped under Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist door in a plain brown envelope, was not a peace offering. It was a warning, carefully damaged. The clue they'd found—the final, unfinished hunt was for—was now a sentence amputated mid-thought. The thief had taken the page, learned what they needed, and returned it mutilated. It like a violation.
So, Harper Lin turned to the one thing that solid, real, and intimately connected to her aunt: the craft. Elara Bell hadn't just written in the journal; she had made it. Every stitch, every glued joint, every choice of paper was a deliberate act. If the words were being stolen and burned, perhaps the book's body still held its secrets.
Morning light, pale and honeyed, fell across the sturdy oak worktable. Harper Lin laid out the journal with the reverence of an archivist. Beside it, she placed Elara Bell's tools: bone folders smooth as river stones, needles with eyes large enough for linen thread, a brass-bound plough for trimming pages, and stacks of marbled paper, their swirling patterns like captured storm clouds or petrified woodgrain.
She started with the endpapers, the decorated leaves glued inside the front and back covers. The journal's were a deep, autumnal marbling—russet reds bleeding into burnt oranges and mossy greens on a cream base. But as Harper Lin bent close, running a finger lightly over the surface, she realized the patterns weren't random. In the front, the swirls coalesced, if you squinted, into the vague shape of an oak leaf. In the back, the pattern swirled around a central, deliberate void that looked like a keyhole.
"A rebus," she murmured. "Picture puzzles."

Her heart beat a little faster. She fetched Elara Bell's own marbling tray, a shallow rectangular bath, and the pots of powdered pigment. Following a well-thumbed recipe card in her aunt's precise script, she mixed a size of carrageenan moss, letting it thicken. She dripped droplets of crimson and umber onto the viscous surface, then dragged a fine-toothed comb through it, creating a ripple of concentric patterns. It was hypnotic, meditative. As she laid a sheet of paper onto the floating paint, lifting a perfect, swirling ghost, she understood. This wasn't just decoration; it was cartography. Each batch was unique. The journal's endpapers were a one-of-a-kind map.
Next, the binding. She examined the spine under a magnifying lamp. The journal was a tight-back binding, the leather adhered directly to the spine folds. But it was the sewing that caught her eye. It was a simple kettle stitch, but the stations—the holes where the needle passed through the signatures—were uneven. Most bindings had evenly spaced holes. This one had a pattern: two close together, a gap, one, a gap, three close together. It looked almost like a clumsy mistake. But Elara Bell never made clumsy mistakes.
Harper Lin grabbed a notepad. She assigned a number to each stitch cluster: 2, 1, 3. She flipped through the journal, checking the sewing stations at the top and bottom. The pattern repeated, but with variations: 1, 2, 4. Then 3, 1, 1. Dates. It had to be. Her mind flew to the library archives. 10/23/92. The last entry before the society disbanded. She scribbled, converting the stitch patterns: 2-1-3 could be February 1st, 1903, or the 21st of March... but in the context of the society, it was more likely 10/23. Two stitches, gap, one stitch, gap, three stitches. 10/23.
"You wove the dates into the very fabric of it," Harper Lin whispered, a swell of affection and awe tightening her throat. The journal wasn't simply a record; it was a structural artifact of the mystery.
The rebus of the endpapers and the stitch-dates needed a key. She pored over the journal's entries around that final date. Sketches of leaves, a tiny, meticulous drawing of the town's old clock tower on the riverbank, a fragment of a poem: "The hours fall like leaves, unnumbered, / Till the mechanism slumbers."

The clock tower. A relic from the town's milling days, its face permanently stuck at quarter past three. The townsfolk called it "Sleeping Time." The stitch pattern pointed to a date. The marbled keyhole shape pointed to... a place to use a key? The clock tower had a small, sealed door at its base, long since rusted shut.
The clock tower. It had to be.
As Harper Lin walked through the town's labyrinthine streets, the journal's secrets and puzzle pieces fell into place. She stopped at the edge of the square, just shy of the clock tower's perimeter. Where the old road forked, the way yawned open like a giant, half-faded page waiting to be turned. She hesitated for a moment, legs splayed, weight shifting from one foot to the other.
Harper Lin continued toward the tower. Inside, it was dim and cluttered with dusty boxes and papers. A faded yellow star-shaped prism hung on a balcony axis, unfinished moustaches and scarred rectangles in elongated splotches onto the neat leaved manuscripts pinned against frames hanging alongside wooden seed racks.

"I found my aunt's journal," Harper Lin said, sliding into the opposite seat, holding Constance's gaze.
