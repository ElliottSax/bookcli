Chapter 10: The Final Chapter of Alistair

Chapter 10: The Final Chapter of Alistair

The air in the old bank vault, which had smelled of cold stone and forgotten paper, now carried a new, metallic note. It was the scent of shock, of history curdling into the present. The skeletal form in the tweed jacket was no longer a literary mystery; it was a man, and he was dead. Harper’s hand, which had been reaching for the leather-bound volume beside the remains, froze in mid-air. The cheerful, whimsical treasure hunt evaporated, leaving a hollow, chilling silence.

Leo was the first to move, pulling Harper gently back from the threshold. “Don’t,” he whispered, his voice rough. “Don’t touch anything.”

Constance Abernathy let out a small, choked sound, not a scream, but the noise a page makes when it’s torn from its binding. All the shrewd calculation had drained from her face, leaving behind the pale, wrinkled visage of a frightened old woman. Mr. Finch simply stared, his habitual frown deepened into a crevice of genuine horror, the promised first edition forgotten in his limp hands.

“Alistair,” Constance breathed. “Oh, you foolish, foolish man.”

The walk back to the surface was a somber, silent procession. The golden light of the equinox afternoon, filtering through the crimson and gold leaves of the square, felt obscenely cheerful. Leo used his phone to call the police from the steps of the mausoleum, his words—"possible remains,” “old bank vault”—sounding ludicrous and grim against the backdrop of children laughing and the distant chime of the ice cream van.

Maplewood’s single police car, followed by a county sheriff’s vehicle, arrived with a quiet urgency that did more to alarm the town than any siren could. Soon, the square was cordoned off with yellow tape that fluttered like a perverse autumn decoration. Word travelled through the town with the swift, whispering efficiency of wind through dry cornstalks. Faces appeared in shop windows. The book club abandoned their discussion of Rebecca on the porch of The Last Page and stood as a silent, anxious clutch near the war memorial.

Sergeant Miller, a broad, practical man with a kind face now set in professional lines, took statements separately. Harper and Leo sat on a bench under the sugar maple, its leaves a fiery canopy, as they explained everything—the clues, the hunt, the discovery. Harper handed over Elara’s diary, her fingers reluctant to part with it.

“Your aunt was a remarkable woman,” Sergeant Miller said, flipping through the pages with careful respect. “But this… this is a thirty-year-old mystery that just became a crime scene.”

Inside the bookshop, Constance sat at Elara’s old oak desk, a cup of untouched tea cooling beside her. She looked small and utterly deflated.

“I didn’t know,” she said to the sergeant, her voice a papery rustle. “I swear to you, I thought he’d left. We all did. He was arrogant, reckless. It made sense he’d run off with his prize.”

“And what was the argument about?” Sergeant Miller asked, his pen poised.

Constance’s eyes filled with a sheen of tears that did not fall. “The treasure. The Treasury. He wanted to take it all. Not just a book or two to save the shop, but everything. To sell it off to some private collector overseas. Elara and I… we were the stewards. We wanted to protect it, to keep it for the town, maybe use it to build a proper library. Alistair called us sentimental fools. He said the magic wasn’t in the sharing, it was in the owning. We met at the mausoleum that night, the night of the last autumn equinox before he… vanished. It was a terrible row. I shouted awful things. I left him there, standing among the graves, his face white with anger in the moonlight. I thought he’d storm off, cool down, maybe even leave town in a huff. I never… I never imagined he’d go back down there alone.”

The forensic team from the county arrived as the long autumn shadows began to stretch across the square. They brought lights and cases into the deepening dusk. Harper watched from the bookshop window, Leo a quiet presence at her shoulder. The whimsical charm of Maplewood was gone, peeled back to reveal the old bones of tragedy beneath.

Later, in the back room of the shop, surrounded by the comforting smell of paper and paste, Harper opened Elara’s diary to the final entries. The writing grew more hurried, the usually perfect script slanting with worry.

October 28th: A. has not been seen for three days. Constance is a wreck, but insists he’s merely gone off in a sulk. I am not so sure. The vault mechanism is jammed from the outside. It can only be locked from the exterior lever. Did he go back? Did he get trapped? The thought is too horrible. I cannot involve the police without revealing everything, and the scandal would destroy the trust we’ve built. I feel sick with fear.

November 1st: I tried to speak to C. again. She is a wall of guilt and denial. She says she left him alive. I must believe her. But the vault is sealed. I cannot bring myself to force it open, to know for certain. If he is in there… oh, it is a tomb of his own making. A final, selfish chapter. I shall keep the secret. To protect the Treasury, to protect Constance, to protect this town from the ugliness of it. But the weight of it, the not-knowing, is a stone upon my heart.

Harper closed the book, her own heart aching. Elara had lived with that stone for thirty years, suspecting, but never allowing herself to truly know. She had rebounded the stolen books not just to protect them from thieves, but perhaps as a form of penance, a way to create beauty from a secret sin.

It was Leo who found the final, missing piece. While helping the police trace the original blueprints of the bank, he discovered a faded addendum: a small, secondary drainage tunnel leading from the lowest vault to the old creek bed, installed in the 1890s and long since forgotten. It had been sealed with a rusty iron grate.

“He must have gone back that night, after the argument,” Leo said, standing with Harper by the creek as the police examined the grate. The air was cold now, smelling of damp earth and decaying leaves. “Maybe to prove he could do it alone. Maybe to take the treasure and disappear for good. The vault door is heavy. If he was inside, examining the books, and the door swung shut… the exterior lever could have been knocked by a falling branch, an animal. It could have locked accidentally.”

“Or,” Harper said softly, the words forming as she spoke them, “someone could have locked it.”

They both looked back toward the square, toward the bookshop. But the guilt, they would learn, was not Constance’s alone to bear.

The official ruling, delivered a week later, was death by misadventure. Alistair Finch, in a reckless attempt to pilfer the Literary Treasury, had been struck on the head by a falling stone dislodged from the crumbling vault ceiling. He had died in the chamber, and the door, whether by a quirk of mechanism or an unlucky external blow, had sealed shut. A tragic end to a selfish act.

Maplewood absorbed the news with a collective, somber sigh. The romantic mystery had turned gothic, a local ghost story made real. Alistair Finch was no longer a dashing rogue, but a cautionary tale. The Treasury, once catalogued by a team of wide-eyed experts from the university, was secured in a climate-controlled room at the town hall, destined to become the centerpiece of a new public library—exactly as Elara and Constance had dreamed.

Constance, aged a decade in a week, sold The Last Page to Harper for a single dollar and a promise to keep its spirit alive. She moved to a cottage by the lake, her passion for books extinguished by a lifetime of hidden guilt.

The autumn deepened, the trees shedding their glorious coats. Harper felt the change in the town’s air. The playful suspense of the hunt was over, replaced by a quieter, more poignant understanding. She had solved her aunt’s puzzle, and in doing so, had uncovered a sadness that would always linger in the corners of the bookshop, like the scent of old paper.

On a crisp afternoon, with a fire crackling in the hearth and the new “Elara’s Nook” section thriving, the bell above the door tinkled. It was Mrs. Greene, the unassuming librarian. She wore a simple tweed coat and carried a small, rectangular parcel wrapped in plain brown paper.

“Hello, Harper,” she said, her voice as soft as ever. “Settling in?”

“Trying to,” Harper replied, offering a smile. “It feels different now. Truer, maybe.”

Mrs. Greene nodded, her eyes wise behind her glasses. “Elara would be proud. You handled it all with a grace she always possessed.” She placed the parcel on the counter. “There’s one last thing your aunt wanted you to have. She left it with me years ago, with very specific instructions. I was to give it to you only after the Treasury was found, and its story… concluded.”

Harper’s fingers trembled slightly as she untied the string and peeled back the paper. Inside was a book. But it was unlike any in the Treasury. It was small, perfectly bound in rich, supple leather the color of a November oak leaf. The craftsmanship was exquisite, every stitch even, the boards smooth and solid. She opened it. The pages were empty. A pristine, beautiful blank.

She looked up, confused. “It’s… blank.”

Mrs. Greene’s lips curved in a faint, knowing smile. “Is it? Elara spent years mastering the art of binding. She said the most important book is never the one that’s already written. It’s the one that waits to be.” She patted the cover gently. “She called that ‘The Last Page of Autumn.’ The story ends, the leaf falls… but the blank page waits for the next hand, the next word. Your hand, Harper. Your words.”

The librarian turned and left, the bell chiming softly behind her.

Harper stood in the quiet shop, the weight of the empty book in her hands. It was not an end, but a peculiar, terrifying, and wonderful beginning. The mystery of the past was solved, its ghosts laid to rest. But as the late afternoon light slanted through the window, gilding the motes of dust that danced over the blank pages, Harper understood. Maplewood’s story, and her own, was no longer something to be simply discovered. It was something she would have to write.

She took a deep breath, the scent of leather and old paper and promise filling her lungs. Then, she reached for a pen.
