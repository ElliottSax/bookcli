Chapter 3: The Veridian Quill

Old paper and dust, once a sterile note in Harper Lin’s life, had become a complex perfume—the ghost of her aunt’s lavender sachets, the tang of autumn apples from a withered bowl on the counter, the profound, earthy smell of stories waiting. Cross-legged on the floor of Maple & Thread, surrounded by a fortress of banker’s boxes, she balanced the cryptic journal on her knees. Through the high, dusty window, thick honeyed afternoon light slanted, illuminating motes that danced like agitated spirits.

*Seek the Quill, where stories hide, beneath the gaze of those who’ve died.* That first acrostic had led her here, to Elara Bell’s personal archives: a chaotic mix of shop ledgers, personal correspondence, and ephemera. Her archivist soul ached to impose order, but the mystery pulled harder.

Grey dust smudged her fingers as they finally closed on a small, unmarked cardboard box tucked behind a stack of *Publishers Weekly* magazines from the 1980s. Inside lay no books, but a collection of artifacts: a tarnished silver lapel pin shaped like a feather, its vanes intricately engraved; a photograph curling at the edges, showing six young people laughing on the steps of the Amberwood gazebo, autumn leaves caught in their hair and sweaters; and a single sheet of heavy, cream-colored paper, embossed at the top with an elegant emblem—a quill pen superimposed over an oak leaf.

Beneath the emblem, fine calligraphy read:

*The Veridian Quill Society*
*Est. 1989*
*Dedicated to the Preservation of Mystery and the Written Word.*
*Members: E. Finch, L. Vance, M. Thorne, P. Chen, R. O’Malley, J. P. Croft.*

Elara Bell. Her aunt’s youthful face beamed from the photograph, an arm linked with a tall, serious-looking young man sporting a formidable brow—Martin Thorne, Harper realized with a start. The president of the historical society. Next to him stood a woman with a wild cloud of dark hair and a mischievous smile, labeled ‘P. Chen.’ A younger, beardless version of the man from the general store—O’Malley—grinned beside a slender man with kind eyes (‘L. Vance’). And at the end, a man with a dramatic swoop of silver hair even then, leaning on a cane with theatrical flair: ‘J. P. Croft.’ Leo Bianchi’s grandfather.

“The Quill.” The words hung in the silent room, making the space feel suddenly less empty.

A soft knock at the front door jolted her. Peering through the shelves revealed Leo Bianchi shifting from foot to foot on the porch, a brown paper bag in his hands. The closed sign was firmly turned, but she went to let him in.

“Peace offering.” He thrust the bag forward, releasing the warm, sweet scent of cinnamon and baked apple. “Apple-cider donuts. Clara said you missed the morning batch. And… an information tax.”

He followed her into the backroom, his eyes immediately finding the photograph and embossed page laid out on the floor. No surprise registered on his face.

“You found them.” Sinking onto a low stool with a sigh, he added, “The Quill.”

“You knew.”

“I suspected. Grandpa Jasper talked about it sometimes, near the end. Called it his ‘league of extraordinary gentlemen and ladies.’ Made it sound like a grand, silly game.” Leo took a donut from the bag, offering one to Harper. The sugar crust melted on her tongue, the apple flavor bright and autumnal.

“Was it just a game?”

He considered, brushing sugar from his fingers. “For them? It was a religion. A way to fight the boredom they said was creeping into Amberwood even then. They’d create elaborate, book-themed treasure hunts for each other. Puzzles in sonnets, clues hidden in hollowed-out books, coordinates mapped to passages in obscure novels. The prize was usually just a nice bottle of sherry or a first edition, but the chase… Grandpa’s eyes would light up like a kid’s remembering it.”

Harper opened the journal to the second riddle, revealed after solving the acrostic. Her voice softened in the dusty air as she read aloud:

*“Where the silent king is shelved, in regimented rows,*
*Seek the heart of his forgotten, unremembered woes.*
*Not in the blood of battle, nor on a throne of gold,*
*But in the quiet lore that the bindings hold.”*

“The silent king, shelved.” Leo mused. “A book with a king in the title? *The Once and Future King*? *The King in Yellow*?”

“Maybe a specific king. A forgotten one.” Harper’s mind, trained in lateral connections, spun. “Or… not a person. A ‘king’ of something. The king of beasts? A lion. *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*?”

“Too obvious. The Quill loved obscurity.” Leo pointed a sticky finger at the embossed sheet. “Martin Thorne. He’s your man for ‘forgotten lore.’ He was the academic of the group. Knew every local legend, every bit of Vermont history. Drove everyone mad with his pedantry, according to Grandpa.”

“He wasn’t exactly helpful when I met him.”

“He wouldn’t be. The Quill disbanded… not well. Something happened. Grandpa got vague and sad whenever it came up. All he’d say was ‘the mystery died, and so did the fun.’ Then your aunt left town for a few years. When she came back and opened this place, she was different. Quieter.”

A chill unrelated to the drafty shop touched Harper’s spine. Sifting through the box again, her fingers found a brittle clipping tucked beneath the photograph, from *The Amberwood Chronicle*, dated October 17, 1993.

LOCAL COLLECTION VANISHES. MYSTERY SURROUNDS RARE BOOK THEFT.

The article was brief. A private collection of rare Vermontiana and early American naturalist texts, belonging to reclusive bibliophile Arthur W. Gable, had been reported stolen from his estate on the outskirts of town. No forced entry. No suspects. The collection, valued at a “substantial sum,” was never recovered. The case grew cold. A quote from the investigating deputy speculated it was “an inside job.” Another, from a “local historian,” lamented the loss to the community’s cultural heritage. The historian was not named, but Harper Lin would have bet her last donut it was Martin Thorne.

She looked up at Leo Bianchi. “Did the Quill have anything to do with this?”

He paled, reading the clipping. “I don’t know. But Grandpa and Arthur Gable were friends. He was devastated when the books were stolen.” He paused. “Elara Bell left town not long after this.”

The pieces floated in Harper Lin’s mind, refusing to connect. A secret society, a theft, a disbanding, a death three decades later that brought her here. She pulled out the slim folder from the town clerk’s office, containing the formalities of her aunt’s passing. The death certificate was stark and bureaucratic. Cause of Death: Cardiac Arrest. Underlying Causes: Advanced Coronary Artery Disease. Manner: Natural.

Natural. A seventy-year-old woman with a known heart condition, found peacefully in her favorite reading chair by the pot-bellied stove, a book open on her lap. The local doctor, the coroner, the sheriff—all saw nothing amiss. It was the picture of a gentle, literary end.

So why did it feel so wrong to Harper Lin? The aunt in the photograph, vibrant and cunning, a creator of mysteries, didn’t seem the type to fade quietly away. She had sent the journal, had left this trail of breadcrumbs. That was the act of someone with a story they urgently needed to tell, not someone at peace with an ending.

“The circumstances feel off,” Harper Lin said, not realizing she’d spoken aloud until Leo Bianchi nodded slowly.

“Everything about Elara Bell’s last few months felt ‘off,’ according to Clara. She was reclusive, even for her. Jumpy. But she also seemed… excited. Like she was working on a big project. She ordered unusual amounts of conservation supplies, special papers.”

“Preservation,” Harper Lin murmured, looking at the Quill’s motto. The Preservation of Mystery and the Written Word. Was her aunt preserving something? Or exposing it?

The light in the room had deepened to a dusky blue. Leo Bianchi stood, stretching. “I have to get back. The dinner rush at the tavern is more of a dinner amble, but I should be there.” He hesitated. “Look, Harper Lin. This is Amberwood. Secrets here… they compost. They become part of the soil. Digging them up can unearth things people have spent a long time forgetting.”

“Do you think I should stop?”

A slow, reluctant smile touched his lips. “No. I think Elara Bell wanted you to dig. And frankly, I’ve missed the mystery.” He was an ally now, however reluctant. “Keep me posted on the silent king.”

After he left, the silence of Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist felt different. It was no longer empty, but watchful. Harper Lin tidied the archives, placing the Veridian Quill materials carefully back in their box, but she kept the journal with her. She ordered takeout from the one Chinese restaurant in town and ate it at Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist’s counter, staring at the rows of books, all potential kings in their silent regiments.

Where the silent king is shelved… She walked the aisles, running her fingers over spines. History, biography, fiction. She stopped in the folklore section. Her eyes scanned: local legends, myths of the Abenaki, tales of the Green Mountains. And there, tucked between two thicker volumes, was a slim, worn binding with no title on its spine. She pulled it out.

Forgotten Lore of the Winding River Valley by M. Thorne. A local vanity press, 1991. Martin Thorne. Her heart beat a little faster. She opened it. The pages were dry, the text a dry recitation of settlement stories and benign ghost tales. But as she flipped towards the middle, a chapter heading caught her eye: “The Lost Monarch of Moss Creek: A Tale of the Shelved King.”

Her breath caught. Shelved king. This was it. The chapter was a folk tale about a lonely, bookish stone carving of a king—a gargoyle or a crumbling statue—that supposedly stood in a forgotten corner of the old Moss Creek cemetery. The “king” was said to guard not treasure, but stories. The tale ended with a cryptic couplet that was almost certainly Thorne’s own addition:

“He watches o’er the silent bed,
Where the town’s first words were read.”

The town’s first words. The first library? The first newspaper? The first school? It was another clue, a thread pulling her deeper. She clutched the book to her chest, a thrill of discovery coursing through her. She would go to the cemetery at first light.

It was fully dark when she returned to Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist, her mind buzzing from dinner with Leo Bianchi where they’d pored over the folklore book and made plans for the morning. A streetlamp cast a jaundiced glow through the front window, painting long, distorted shadows from the shelves. She flipped the lock and stepped inside, reaching for the light switch.

Her hand froze.

Something was different. The air held a faint, new discord in its dusty symphony—a note of cold, night air and a subtle displacement. Her eyes, adjusted to the gloom, scanned Maple & Thread: a hybrid book and yarn shop inherited by the protagonist. Nothing was overturned, no shelves ransacked. But the space had been visited.

She moved to the backroom, her footsteps loud in the hush. Her desk, where she had left the Veridian Quill journal squarely in the center before going to dinner, was bare.

A cold fist closed around her heart. She fumbled for the desk lamp, clicking it on. The yellow pool of light confirmed it. The journal was gone.

A desperate, sinking feeling turned to anger. She wouldn’t lose this. Not after coming so far. She began to search, methodically, frantically. She checked the floor, the shelves, the counter. Nothing.

With a sob of frustration, she yanked open the top drawer of the desk. And there it was. Neatly placed inside, as if someone had tidied it away.

She snatched it up, relief flooding her. But as she lifted it, the book fell open to the middle. The spine cracked in a new, terrible way.

A gasp tore from her throat.

A single page had been torn out. Not ripped in anger, but removed with precise, careful violence. The ragged edge of the binding was a clean wound in the center of the book. The pages before and after—detailing what looked like a complex cipher system, a key to the Quill’s puzzles—were now orphaned, leading to and from a void.

Whoever had been here hadn’t stolen the journal. They had taken only what they needed. They had been in her sanctuary, handled her aunt’s last testament, and surgically removed its heart. And they had wanted her to know it.

Harper Lin stood in the lamplight, the wounded journal trembling in her hands. The autumnal charm of Amberwood peeled away like old varnish, revealing the grain of something harder, older, and far more dangerous beneath. The mystery was no longer a whimsical treasure hunt. It was a conversation. And someone else was speaking now.
