Chapter 12: The First Page of Winter

Chapter 12: The First Page of Winter

The first true frost had come in the night, painting the windows of ‘The Last Page’ with delicate, feathery ferns. Harper stood on the other side of the glass, breathing in the quiet of the early morning. The world outside was hushed, the vibrant chaos of autumn having settled into the stark, clean lines of winter’s preamble. The shop bell, which she’d polished until it shone like a captive sun, waited silently above the door.

Inside, the air smelled of old paper, fresh coffee, and the faint, clean scent of the pine garland she’d draped along the mantelpiece. The transformation was not drastic, but it was profound. The clutter had been curated, the dust banished. The books stood in respectful rows, but they also invited exploration. A new, well-lit corner by the fireplace held two sturdy tables: one for bookbinding, with pots of glue, needles, and threads, and stacks of beautiful marbled paper; the other was a puzzle table, currently holding a half-completed jigsaw of a starry night and a chess set with pieces carved like literary characters—kings and queens as Shakespearean monarchs, rooks as miniature castle turrets.

This was no longer a tomb of forgotten stories. It was a hearth for them.

The real change, however, was in the back room. The heavy oak table, once buried under ephemera, now sat clear, surrounded by seven mismatched but comfortable chairs. On the wall hung a framed, calligraphed charter for the reformed Amberwood Quill Society. The first rule, penned by Harper in her aunt’s own iron-gall ink, read: No mystery shall be valued above a person. No puzzle shall be solved at the cost of a heart.

Harper ran a hand over the new shop sign she’d had made, hanging behind the main counter. It read, in elegant script: The Last Page: Books, Binding, & Bespoke Solutions. The “Bespoke Solutions” part had been Leo’s suggestion, delivered with a grin. “Sounds more respectable than ‘meddling in mysteries,’” he’d said.

The discovery of Alistair Finch’s body in the root cellar of the old Gable estate had sent a seismic shudder through Amberwood. The subsequent, quiet confession from a shattered Mr. Finch had explained the mechanics of the tragedy—a terrible accident during a heated argument over the Treasury’s fate, a panicked concealment—but not its soul-wound. Constance had left town, her historical society ambitions ashes. The Treasury itself, after much discussion led by Harper, now resided in a dedicated room at the Amberwood Museum, a collection for everyone, its final clue—The heart is not a vault—displayed alongside Elara’s journal.

Harper’s inheritance was no longer a question. It was an answer. She was the keeper of the shop, and in a way, the keeper of the town’s gentle, peculiar secrets.

The day passed in a warm, busy blur. Mrs. Henderson bought three poetry collections and stayed for an hour discussing the merits of sonnets over villanelles. Old Mr. Greeley brought in a first edition of The Wind in the Willows with a damaged spine, which Harper promised to restore. Children bundled like woolly bears came in after school, beelining for the new children’s nook stocked with adventures and picture books about friendly ghosts.

As the indigo winter twilight began to bleed across the sky, the members of the new Quill Society began to arrive. There was Martha from the post office, her fingers itching for something more complex than sorting mail. Ben, the retired chemistry teacher, whose mind loved logical patterns. Eleanor Vance, who had been a friend of Elara’s and whose eyes held a new, grateful light when she looked at Harper. And Leo.

He arrived last, bringing with him the cold, clean smell of winter air and a paper bag from the bakery. “Peace offering,” he said, placing a still-warm apple cranberry tart on the puzzle table. “For commandeering your meeting.”

“You’re a member,” Harper said, trying and failing to suppress a smile. “It’s your meeting too.”

The meeting was nothing like the secretive, agenda-driven sessions of the past. They drank tea, ate the tart, and discussed the cryptic crossword from the weekend paper. They helped Ben brainstorm a puzzle for his granddaughter’s birthday treasure hunt. Eleanor shared a story about Elara trying to bake a “clue cake” that ended up cement-like. The room filled with laughter, a sound that felt like it healed the very floorboards.

Later, after the others had left, Harper and Leo tidied up. The silence between them was comfortable, filled only with the clink of china and the soft crackle of the fire.

“She’d love this, you know,” Leo said, drying a teacup. “Not just the shop. The… tone of it.”

Harper looked around. The soft glow of lamps on dark wood, the shadows dancing between bookshelves, the sense of quiet anticipation. “I feel her here differently now. Less like a ghost I’m chasing, more like a… guide standing in the corner, nodding.”

Leo put the cup away and leaned against the counter, facing her. The firelight caught the gold flecks in his brown eyes. “You’ve given the town a piece of its heart back, Harper. And not from the Treasury.”

Her face grew warm, and not from the fireplace. “I just opened a bookshop.”

“You opened a place,” he corrected gently. “They’re rare.”

He reached out, his fingers brushing a stray lock of hair that had escaped from her braid, tucking it behind her ear. The touch was fleeting, but it sent a current through the still air of the shop. For a moment, the only mystery in the room was the space between them, charged and sweet and terrifying.

“Leo…” she began, not knowing what to say next.

The shop bell chimed.

They jumped apart like guilty teenagers. Harper’s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, joyful rhythm. A customer. Late.

“I should…” she gestured vaguely towards the front.

“Right. Of course.” He rubbed the back of his neck, a boyish gesture that made her want to smile. “I’ll finish up here.”

Harper walked to the front, smoothing her apron. The day had been long and perfect, and she was ready to end it, to sit with her own thoughts and the memory of that almost-moment. She expected a harried parent looking for a last-minute gift.

But the man standing just inside the door, a dusting of frost on his shoulders, was no one she knew. He was tall, wrapped in a long, charcoal-grey coat that had seen better seasons. In his gloved hands, he held a book. Not a new one. It was a bulky, tattered volume, its cover a scuffed and faded leather, the spine reinforced with peeling tape. He held it not like a reader, but like a reliquary.

“I’m so sorry,” Harper said, her bookseller’s smile automatically in place. “We were just closing up.”

The man’s eyes found hers. They were a pale, watery blue, tired but intensely focused. He didn’t look around at the shop, the garlands, the inviting chairs. He looked only at her.

“Harper Jones?” he asked, his voice a dry rasp, as if from disuse.

“Yes?”

He took a step forward. The floorboard creaked under his weight. He lifted the book slightly, an offering, or a challenge.

“I was told you’re the person who can solve impossible puzzles.”

The words hung in the warm, scented air of the shop like a sudden, cold draft. All the contentment of the day, the warmth of the society meeting, the fragile, new feeling for Leo—it all condensed into a single, sharp point of focus. Here, on the first page of her new winter, was another story, knocking at the door.

She saw Leo appear in the doorway to the back room, a dish towel in his hands, his expression alert.

Harper looked from the stranger’s earnest, weary face to the book in his hands. It was not like her aunt’s journal. It was older, heavier with a different kind of silence. She thought of her own new journal, waiting upstairs on her desk, its first page bearing her hopeful, fictional beginning: Chapter One: The shop bell chimed on a crisp winter morning…

Life, it seemed, preferred its own openings.

She did not usher him out. She did not lock the door. She felt the mantle of her aunt, and of her own strange journey, settle onto her shoulders—not a burden, but a purpose.

“We were just making some tea,” she said, her voice surprisingly steady. “Would you like to come in and tell me about it?”

The man’s shoulders, tense as drawn bowstrings, lowered just a fraction. He nodded, a gesture of profound relief. As he stepped fully into the light, Harper saw the book’s title, stamped in barely-visible gold on the spine: A Compendium of Lost Tides.

Leo moved forward, not as a rival, but as a partner, pulling out a chair by the fire. Harper rounded the counter, her curiosity now a live thing, fluttering beside her heart. The shop, for all its warmth, seemed to hold its breath. The last page of autumn had been turned. But every book, as she well knew, contained more than one story. And as the stranger placed his mysterious volume on the puzzle table, its worn cover whispering against the wood, Harper knew with a thrilling certainty that hers was just beginning.
