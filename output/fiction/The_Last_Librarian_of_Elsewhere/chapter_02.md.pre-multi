Chapter 2: The First Exile

Chapter 2: The First Exile

The silence after the portal’s collapse was a physical thing, thick and humming, like the air after a struck bell. Leo stood in the wreckage of his archive’s central aisle, the smell of ozone and old paper sharp in his nose. His hands, which had moments before felt like conduits for a storm, now trembled with a familiar, feeble weakness. The cancer in his bones gave a sullen throb, a reminder that the spectacle had been fueled by borrowed time.

And in the center of the room, clutching a tattered, moss-green satchel to its chest, was the creature.

It was smaller than Leo had first thought, perhaps four feet tall, with skin the colour of tarnished pewter and large, luminous eyes that held the gold-flecked green of forest pools. Its ears were long, pointed, and twitched like a nervous hare’s. It wore a patchwork coat of what looked like book bindings—calfskin, vellum, faded cloth—stitched together with coarse thread. It was, against all reason and medical explanation, a goblin.

“You,” Leo managed, his voice a dry rasp. “You’re real.”

The creature blinked its large eyes. “More real than the prognosis you were reading an hour ago, Archivist Leo Thorne. And considerably more grateful.” Its voice was not the croak he might have expected, but melodic, with a rhythm like water over stones.

“You know my name.”

“I heard you speak it. In your… lamentation. It was a powerful piece of unsung verse. Very resonant.” The goblin took a tentative step forward, its bare, long-toed feet silent on the Persian rug. “I am Poggle. A poet. And, it seems, your first guest.”

Leo’s legs gave way. He didn’t collapse so much as fold, sinking into his worn leather armchair by the extinct fireplace. The adrenaline was deserting him, leaving the bleak, familiar landscape of his exhaustion. “A poet. Of course. Because a dying man hallucinating a portal in his library would naturally summon a poet.”

“Not summon,” Poggle corrected gently. He approached, not with menace, but with the cautious reverence of one entering a shrine. His gaze swept over the towering shelves, the glass-fronted cases holding incunabula, the rolled maps in their ivory cylinders. A long-fingered hand, with nails like polished slate, reached out but stopped just short of touching a first edition of Coleridge. “You opened. A World-Key, turning in the lock of despair. A rare and terrible thing.”

“Stop.” Leo pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes, seeing phantom spirals of light. “Just stop. I am a man with a glioblastoma. I am on powerful painkillers. This is… this is a very detailed, very cruel dream.”

Poggle hopped onto a footstool, bringing them closer to eye level. He opened his satchel and withdrew not a book, but a smooth, river-worn stone. He breathed on it, and its surface shimmered, revealing lines of delicate, glowing script that swam like minnows. “In my world—a place you might call Elsewhere’s cousin, the realm of Gloaming—verse is not merely art. It is architecture. It is agriculture. A well-crafted couplet can mend a wall. A sonnet sequence guides the river’s flow. My crime,” he said, and for the first time his melodic voice hit a discordant note of bitterness, “was unprofitable poetry.”

Leo lowered his hands. The creature’s sorrow had a tangible weight to it, a scent of damp leaves and distant rain.

“Unprofitable?”

“The Consortium of Gleam took hold generations ago,” Poggle recited, as if from a well-memorized indictment. “They metricized metaphor. They standardized stanza structure for maximum resource yield. My poetry… it spoke of moss growing on the north side of forgotten things. It praised the inefficiency of laughter. It was, according to the Quarterly Verse Audit, ‘deviant, decadent, and fiscally inert.’” He clutched the stone. “The punishment for repeated aesthetic non-compliance is Verse-Exile. The stripping of one’s poetic license, and ejection from the narrative stream of one’s own world. I was cast into the Between—the non-space that pools in the cracks of reality. Most exiles dissolve there, their stories untold. I was adrift, a fading footnote. Until your key turned.”

Leo stared at him. The explanation was insane. Yet, it clicked into place with a terrifying logic. It explained the lifelong sense of otherness, the way books had always felt like doors he could almost push open, the strange, spatial headaches that preceded his diagnosis. It explained the vortex born of his tears.

“A World-Key,” Leo whispered.

“A genetic anomaly,” Poggle nodded. “A soul attuned to the bindings of reality. Usually, they are hunted young and trained by the Cartographers’ Guild. Yours… yours went unnoticed. Shelved, like one of your books.” The goblin’s eyes shone with a desperate hope. “You are a sanctuary, Archivist. A library is a fortress of unprofitable truths. And you have opened a door.”

Before Leo could process this—the shift from terminal patient to accidental sanctuary keeper—a new sound penetrated the thick silence of the archive. Not the hum of magic, but the crunch of gravel on the drive. Then, the definitive, mundane ding-dong of the front doorbell.

Reality, the boring, brutal kind, came crashing back. Leo lurched to his feet, peering through a crack in the boarded-up window. Outside, in the grey afternoon light, a sleek, black vehicle idled, its windows tinted to obsidian. Two figures stood at his door. They wore identical black suits, cut with severe precision, and their faces were obscured by data-glasses that glinted with a cold, blue light. One held a device—a sleek tablet with a dish antenna that slowly panned across the front of the house.

“Who are they?” Poggle hissed, his ears flattened against his skull.

“I don’t know.” But a cold certainty settled in Leo’s gut. They weren’t doctors. They weren’t solicitors. They moved with a synchronized, predatory patience.

The doorbell rang again, longer this time. Then a voice, amplified, neutral, devoid of locality, echoed through the old wood. “Mr. Thorne. OmniCorp Historical Reconciliation. We have a warrant for a spectral anomaly scan. Please open the door.”

OmniCorp. The name was a blight on the news. A conglomerate that bought failing towns, privatized water, and patented genes. They had no business with historical reconciliation.

“They’re scanning for dimensional energy,” Poggle whispered, panic threading his words. “The portal’s echo. They’re Hounds!”

“Hounds?”

“Corporate verse-breakers! They sniff out unstable narratives, unlicensed doorways… they harvest exiles!” Poggle was off the footstool, quivering. “If they find me, they’ll bottle my essence for market-research divination! They’ll turn your archive into a spreadsheet!”

A heavy fist landed on the door, not a knock but a testing blow. Thud.

Logic, the careful, cataloguing part of Leo’s mind, took over. He was not a man of action, but he was a man of preservation. This was his collection. His life’s work. These black-suited things were a threat to it. And the terrified, poetic creature before him was now, inexplicably, part of the collection.

“Come with me,” Leo said, his voice low and steady.

“Where? There is no back door from this narrative!”

“Down.” Leo moved to a seemingly solid section of oak shelving laden with 19th-century horticultural journals. He found the hidden catch—a carved acorn knob that most mistook for decoration. A soft click, and a section of the shelf swung inward, revealing a steep, narrow staircase descending into darkness. “My grandfather was a paranoid bibliophile. He built a sub-basement for his most ‘dangerous’ acquisitions. Mostly just erotic poetry and anarchist pamphlets, but it’s shielded. Lead-lined.”

Poggle didn’t need further encouragement. He scurried into the dark hole. Leo followed, pulling the shelf-door shut just as the front door splintered with a sickening crack.

From below, the sounds were muffled, but distinct. The tread of heavy shoes on his wooden floors. The soft, electronic pings and whirrs of their scanning device. Leo and Poggle crouched in the absolute black of the sub-basement, a tiny, dusty space that smelled of old stone and older fear. A single, bare bulb hung from a cord. Leo did not pull it.

They listened. Drawers were opened. Books were pulled from shelves and dropped, a sound that made Leo flinch as if struck. He heard the agents speaking, their voices filtered and strange.

“Residual theta-wave signature concentrated in the central atrium. Significant.”
“No visible breach point. Source is… diffuse. Human-shaped.”
“Subject Thorne. Terminal. Medical files indicate elevated psionic potential. Unregistered.”
“Recommendation: Acquisition and dissection. The archive is a contamination risk. Schedule sanitization.”

Leo’s blood turned to ice. Acquisition and dissection. Sanitization. They spoke of him and his life’s work like a pest infestation.

Poggle’s small, cold hand found his in the dark. “The Stacks,” the goblin breathed, almost inaudibly.
“What?”
“The Stacks of Avalon. It is a myth exiles whisper in the Between. A library that exists between all worlds, a sanctuary for lost stories and those who tell them. A place OmniCorp cannot reach. I thought it was just a dream… but you. A Key, in a library. You could be the way.”

Upstairs, the footsteps paused directly above them. A scanner whined, a high-pitched frequency that made Leo’s teeth ache. It passed over, hesitated, then moved on. The lead was holding.

For twenty agonizing minutes, they listened to the violation. Then, finally, the footsteps receded. The front door, broken, creaked on its hinges. The car engine purred to life and faded away.

Leo waited another full ten minutes, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs, before he dared to push open the shelf-door.

The archive was a disaster. Books lay sprawled on the floor like fallen birds. Cabinets hung open. His desk had been swept clear. But they had taken nothing. It was not loot they were after. It was data. And him.

He went to the window. The black car was gone. The grey afternoon was settling into a damp, chilly evening. His shoulders slumped, a wave of nauseating relief and profound violation washing over him. He was safe. For now.

Then he saw it.

On the wet gravel of the drive, exactly where the passenger had stood, a small, metallic disc glinted. It was the size of a coin, but with a complex, etched surface. As Leo watched, a tiny pinprick of red light on its circumference pulsed once, slowly, like a sleeping heartbeat.

They hadn’t given up.

They had left a watchful, mechanical eye.

“Poggle,” Leo said, his voice hollow. “Get up here.”

The goblin emerged, his face ashen. He followed Leo’s pointing finger and let out a soft, despairing keen. “A tracker. Keyed to your unique resonance now. They’re not leaving. They’re laying a trap. They know you’re here. They know you’re… valuable.”

Leo Thorne looked from the pulsing tracker on the gravel to the beautiful, heartbreaking ruin of his archive. He looked at the terrified, exiled poet from another world, who believed in myths of safe havens. He felt the familiar, deep ache in his bones, the countdown clock in his cells that had, until today, been the only thing that defined him.

Now, he was something else. A Key. A target. A sanctuary of one.

The melancholy that settled over him was not the old, passive sadness of his diagnosis. It was a sharper, clearer thing—the grief for a quiet ending he would now never have. But within it, kindling in the darkness, was a spark of something else. A purpose, unprofitable and wild.

He turned from the window. “Tell me everything,” he said to Poggle, his voice no longer a rasp, but a low, steady command. “About the Stacks. About these Hounds. About how a door is opened on purpose.” He walked to the fallen copy of The Anatomy of Melancholy, picked it up, and gently smoothed its pages. “We have until that light turns green, I expect. And then we need to be elsewhere.”
