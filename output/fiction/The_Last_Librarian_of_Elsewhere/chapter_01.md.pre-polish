ling free, hot and bitter against his cheeks. This is it. This is the moment I accept that I'm dying. The realization was a crushing weight, a finality that left him breathless. The world around him blurred, the sounds of A modern hospital and its gardens (Opening) fading into the background, replaced by the pounding of his own heart, a relentless drumbeat that echoed the urgency of his situation. He took a deep, shuddering breath, the air tasting of salt and sorrow, a bitter reminder of the life he was about to lose. He opened his eyes, the world coming back into focus, the colors muted and dull, a reflection of the emptiness inside him. He stood, his legs unsteady, and began to walk, each step a struggle, a battle against the tide of despair that threatened to overwhelm him. He didn't know where he was going, only that he needed to move, to keep going, to keep fighting, even if it was a fight he knew he couldn't win. The A modern hospital and its gardens (Opening) stretched out before him, a labyrinth of paths and flowers, a place of beauty and tranquility that seemed to mock the chaos inside him. He walked, his footsteps echoing in the silence, the only sound the distant hum of the city, a reminder of the world that would continue without him. He reached the edge of A modern hospital and its gardens (Opening), the fence a stark reminder of the boundaries that now confined him. He leaned against it, the cool metal a welcome relief against his feverish skin, and looked out at the city, the skyline a jagged silhouette against the sky. This is the world I'm leaving behind. This is the world that will go on without me. The thought was a bitter pill, a harsh reality he had to swallow whole. He closed his eyes, the tears he had been holding back finally spilling free, hot and bitter against his cheeks. This is it. This is the moment I accept that I'm dying.

His phone buzzed, a sharp vibration against his leg. He ignored it, but it buzzed again. And again. With a trembling hand, he pulled it out. Not a call, but a cascade of notifications—emails from an unknown sender, their subject lines a chilling sequence: CONFIRMATION OF DIAGNOSIS: A67 ANOMALY... PATIENT ZERO: SOURCE IDENTIFIED... YOUR BLOODWORK CONTAINS THE KEY.

The final email’s header was just three words: YOU ARE NOT DYING.

A cold, electric shock severed his despair. He fumbled, opening the message. The text was sparse, clinical. The anomaly in your cells is not degenerative. It is adaptive. You were not infected at the site. You are the site. The initial patient, the carrier, showed no symptoms for eighteen months. You have seventeen. They are watching you. Do not return to your room.

He stared at the screen until the words blurred. The crushing weight of acceptance shattered, replaced by a terrifying, vertiginous lift. He wasn't terminal. He was something else. Something they had locked in a hospital and studied. A sob caught in his throat, not of grief, but of sheer, unadulterated terror. The distant hum of the city wasn't a reminder of a world continuing without him. It was the sound of a world he was now dangerously, irrevocably part of. And they were watching. He slowly turned from the fence, his eyes scanning the dark hospital windows, each one a potential eye. His next breath wasn't salt and sorrow. It was the metallic taste of a new, unimaginable fear.
