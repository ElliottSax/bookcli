Chapter 8: The Ashes of Home

The world shattered in a scream of fractured light and the taste of burnt copper. There was no transition—just the violent erasure of the sterile white cell, replaced at once by a new reality.

Bryn hit the ground first, the impact jolting up through her knees. Not metal grating, but something soft. Ash. Fine, grey ash, ankle-deep, puffing up around her in a silent cloud. Leo stumbled out of the air beside her, retching, the prototype Key in his hand sputtering its last emerald sparks. He collapsed to his hands and knees, coughing wetly.

The air hit Bryn like a fist. It wasn’t the clean chill of OmniCorp or the damp salt of Elsewhere’s ruins. This air was thick, warm, heavy with decay: the bite of ozone, the sweet-rot of something long dead, and underneath it all, the ghost of smoke and rust. She breathed it in, and her heart broke.

“Leo,” she gasped, turning.

He was trying to stand, his face pale under the grime. “I’m… alright.” The lie ended in another cough. He looked up, and his eyes went wide. “Bryn… where…?”

She followed his gaze, and the broken pieces of her heart turned to dust.

This was the Glade of Whispering Suns. This had been her home.

The great whispering sun-trees were gone. Not cut down, but extracted. All that remained were vast, geometric craters, their edges melted to glassy slag. The sky was a permanent twilight, stained ochre and bruised purple by haze. Where the crystal brook used to run, a trench of cracked mud and oily sludge now snaked through the ash. The gentle hum of her world was gone, replaced by a low industrial drone coming up from the ground, and the occasional distant crump of something collapsing.

“They stripped it,” Bryn whispered, her voice hollow. “They took the resonance, the heartwood, the ley-sap… and left the corpse.”

Numb, she walked through the ash. Her boot hit something buried. She knelt, brushing the grey powder away. A fragment of a ceramic bowl, painted with the constellation pattern her mother used for Star-Fall. The paint was still bright—a tiny rebellion against all this grey. She clutched it, the edges digging into her palm. The pain was an anchor.

Leo came to stand beside her, breathing too fast, too shallow. “We need shelter. This air…”

He was right. The haze already stung her eyes and scraped her throat. For Leo, his system wrecked by the Key, it was poison. They trudged toward the only things still standing: the broken silica-spires on the ridge ahead, their tops snapped off like rotten teeth against the sick sky.

As they walked, Bryn named the ghosts. “That crater… that was the Grand Silvan, where the Elders convened. Its—”
