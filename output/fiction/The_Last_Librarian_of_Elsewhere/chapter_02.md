Chapter 2: The First Exile

Silence, thick and humming like the air after a struck bell, settled in the wake of the portal’s collapse. In the wreckage of his archive’s central aisle, Leo stood, the smell of ozone and old paper sharp in his nose. His hands, which moments before had channeled a storm, now trembled with a familiar, feeble weakness. A sullen throb echoed from deep within his bones—the cancer’s reminder that the spectacle had been fueled by borrowed time.

And in the center of the room, clutching a tattered, moss-green satchel, was the creature.

Smaller than first thought, perhaps four feet tall, it had skin the colour of tarnished pewter and large, luminous eyes holding the gold-flecked green of forest pools. Long, pointed ears twitched like a nervous hare’s. A patchwork coat of what looked like book bindings—calfskin, vellum, faded cloth—stitched together with coarse thread, covered its frame. Against all reason and medical explanation, it was a goblin.

“You,” Leo managed, his voice a dry rasp. “You’re real.”

The creature blinked its large eyes. “More real than the prognosis you were reading an hour ago, Archivist Leo Thorne. And considerably more grateful.” Its voice was not a croak, but melodic, with a rhythm like water over stones.

“You know my name.”

“I heard you speak it. In your… lamentation. A powerful piece of unsung verse. Very resonant.” Taking a tentative step forward, the goblin was silent on the Persian rug with its bare, long-toed feet. “I am Poggle. A poet. And, it seems, your first guest.”

Leo’s legs gave way. He didn’t collapse so much as fold, sinking into his worn leather armchair by the extinct fireplace. Adrenaline deserted him, leaving the bleak, familiar landscape of his exhaustion. “A poet. Of course. Because a dying man hallucinating a portal in his library would naturally summon a poet.”

“Not summon,” Poggle corrected gently. Approaching with the cautious reverence of one entering a shrine, its gaze swept over the towering shelves, the glass-fronted cases holding incunabula, the rolled maps in their ivory cylinders. A long-fingered hand, with nails like polished slate, reached out but stopped just short of touching a first edition of Coleridge. “You opened. A World-Key, turning in the lock of despair. A rare and terrible thing.”

“Stop.” Pressing the heels of his hands against his eyes, Leo saw phantom spirals of light. “Just stop. I am a man with a glioblastoma. I am on powerful painkillers. This is… this is a very detailed, very cruel dream.”

Hopping onto a footstool, Poggle brought them closer to eye level. From the satchel came not a book, but a smooth, river-worn stone. A breath across its surface made it shimmer, revealing lines of delicate, glowing script that swam like minnows. “In my world—a place you might call Elsewhere’s cousin, the world of Gloaming—verse is not merely art. It is architecture. Agriculture. A well-crafted couplet can mend a wall. A sonnet sequence guides the river’s flow. My crime,” Poggle said, the melodic voice hitting a discordant note of bitterness for the first time, “was unprofitable poetry.”

Leo lowered his hands. The creature’s sorrow carried a tangible weight, a scent of damp leaves and distant rain.

“Unprofitable?”

“The Consortium of Gleam took hold generations ago,” Poggle recited, as if from a well-memorized indictment. “They metricized metaphor. Standardized stanza structure for maximum resource yield. My poetry… it spoke of moss growing on the north side of forgotten things. It praised the inefficiency of laughter. According to the Quarterly Verse Audit, it was ‘deviant, decadent, and fiscally inert.’” The stone was clutched tighter. “The punishment for repeated aesthetic non-compliance is Verse-Exile. The stripping of one’s poetic license, and ejection from the narrative stream of one’s own world. Cast into the Between—the non-space that pools in the cracks of reality. Most exiles dissolve there, their stories untold. I was adrift, a fading footnote. Until your key turned.”

Leo stared. The explanation was insane. Yet it clicked into place with a terrifying logic, explaining the lifelong sense of otherness, the way books had always felt like doors he could almost push open, the strange, spatial headaches that preceded his diagnosis. It explained the vortex born of his tears.

“A World-Key,” Leo whispered.

“A genetic anomaly,” Poggle nodded. “A soul attuned to the bindings of reality. Usually, they are hunted young and trained by the Cartographers’ Guild. Yours… yours went unnoticed. Shelved, like one of your books.” The goblin’s eyes shone with a desperate hope. “You are a sanctuary, Archivist. A library is a fortress of unprofitable truths. And you have opened a door.”

Before Leo could process this—the shift from terminal patient to accidental sanctuary keeper—a new sound penetrated the archive’s thick silence. Not the hum of magic, but the crunch of gravel on the drive. Then, the definitive, mundane ding-dong of the front doorbell.

Reality, the boring, brutal kind, came crashing back. Lurching to his feet, Leo peered through a crack in the boarded-up window. Outside, in the grey afternoon light, a sleek, black vehicle idled, its windows tinted to obsidian. Two figures stood at his door. Identical black suits, cut with severe precision, covered their frames; data-glasses obscuring their faces glinted with a cold, blue light. One held a device—a sleek tablet with a dish antenna slowly panning across the front of the house.

“Who are they?” Poggle hissed, ears flattened against his skull.

“I don’t know.” A cold certainty settled in Leo’s gut. They weren’t doctors. They weren’t solicitors. Their movements held a synchronized, predatory patience.

The doorbell rang again, longer this time. Then a voice, amplified, neutral, devoid of emotion, called out, “Archivist Leo Thorne, we are representatives of the Cartographers’ Guild. Please open the door immediately.”

A frantic drumbeat kicked against Leo’s ribs, each pulse a hammer blow of raw alarm., a frantic drumbeat. He glanced at Poggle, who had retreated to the shadows, his eyes wide with fear. The air in the room seemed to thicken, charged with an unseen tension.

“What do I do?” Leo whispered, his voice barely audible over the pounding of his heart.

Poggle’s eyes flickered with a mix of desperation and resolve. “You must hide me. They will not understand. They will not see the beauty in what you have done. They will only see a breach, a threat to their order.”

Leo’s mind raced. He had no experience with such matters, no training in the art of concealment or confrontation. But something in Poggle’s plea, the raw vulnerability in those luminous eyes, stirred a protective instinct within him. He gestured towards a narrow, hidden alcove behind a bookshelf. “Go. Hide there. I’ll try to buy some time.”

Poggle nodded, his movements swift and silent as he slipped into the alcove, disappearing from view. Leo took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. He walked to the door, each step heavy with the weight of the unknown.

He opened the door a crack, peering out at the two suited figures. “Yes?”

One of them, the one with the tablet, stepped forward. “Mr. Thorne, we need to come in. We have reason to believe that a World-Key has been activated in your residence.”

Leo’s throat tightened. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m just a librarian. I deal with books, not… keys.”

The man’s data-glasses flickered, and he tilted his head slightly. “We have evidence to the contrary. Cooperation will be in your best interest.”

Leo’s mind raced. He couldn’t let them in, not with Poggle hidden inside. “I’m sorry, but I’m not feeling well. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately. Can this wait until another time?”

The man’s expression didn’t change, but his tone grew colder. “This cannot wait, Mr. Thorne. We must inspect the premises immediately.”

Leo’s heart sank. He knew he couldn’t keep them out forever. “Fine,” he said, stepping back and opening the door wider. “But I really don’t know what you’re looking for.”

The two men entered, their presence filling the room with an unsettling aura of authority. They moved with purpose, scanning the space with their devices. Leo watched, his hands trembling, as they approached the central aisle where the portal had collapsed.

The lead agent stopped, his device beeping softly. He crouched down, examining the ground. “There’s residual energy here. A recent breach.”

Leo’s stomach churned. “I swear, I don’t know anything about this. I’ve been alone all day.”

The agent stood up, his eyes narrowing behind the data-glasses. “We’ll need to search the entire property. Stay here.”

Leo nodded, his mind racing. He had to find a way to protect Poggle, to keep him safe from these intruders. As the agents began their methodical search, Leo’s eyes darted around the room, searching for any sign of escape or hiding place.

The seconds ticked by, each one a torture. Leo’s anxiety grew with every step the agents took, every beep of their devices. He knew that if they found Poggle, everything would change. The fragile world he had built, the sanctuary he had unknowingly created, would crumble.

Suddenly, the lead agent paused, his device emitting a high-pitched whine. He turned towards the alcove where Poggle was hidden. “There’s a significant energy signature here. Open it.”

Leo’s heart nearly stopped. He stepped forward, his voice shaking. “Please, I don’t—”

The agent’s hand shot out, grabbing Leo’s arm. “Stay back. We need to check this.”

Leo’s mind raced. He had to think fast, act quickly. “Wait, I can explain. There’s nothing there. It’s just an old bookshelf. I promise.”

The agent’s grip tightened, and he pushed past Leo, moving towards the alcove. Leo’s heart pounded in his chest, a frantic drumbeat. He knew he had to do something, anything, to stop them.

In a moment of desperation, Leo lunged forward, grabbing the agent’s arm. “Please, you can’t—”

The agent spun, his hand moving to his belt. Leo’s eyes widened as he saw the glint of a weapon. He knew he was outmatched, but he couldn’t let them harm Poggle. With a surge of adrenaline, he shoved the agent, pushing him away from the alcove.

The agent stumbled, his device falling to the floor with a clatter. The second agent rushed to his side, drawing his own weapon. “Stand down, Mr. Thorne. You’re making a mistake.”

Leo backed away, his hands raised. “I just want to help. Please, don’t hurt anyone.”

The lead agent regained his footing, his eyes cold and calculating. “You have no idea what you’re dealing with. Step aside.”

Leo’s mind raced. He had to find a way to stall, to give Poggle a chance to escape. He glanced around the room, his eyes landing on a heavy, ancient tome on a nearby shelf. Without thinking, he grabbed it and hurled it at the agents.

The book struck the lead agent in the shoulder, causing him to stagger. The second agent fired a warning shot, the sound deafening in the quiet room. Leo ducked, his heart pounding.

“Enough!” the lead agent shouted, his voice filled with anger. “We will not hesitate to use force.”

Leo’s breath came in ragged gasps. He knew he was running out of options. He had to make a decision, and he had to make it now.

With a final, desperate glance at the alcove, Leo made his choice. He stepped forward, his hands still raised. “I’ll cooperate. Just… please, don’t hurt anyone.”

The agents exchanged a glance, their expressions unreadable. The lead agent nodded, holstering his weapon. “Very well. Step aside, and we will conduct our search.”

Leo complied, his body trembling with exhaustion and fear. As the agents moved towards the alcove, he closed his eyes, praying that Poggle would find a way to escape.

The lead agent reached the alcove and hesitated, his device beeping urgently. He opened the hidden door, revealing the empty space inside. Poggle was gone.

The agent’s expression changed, a flicker of surprise crossing his face. He turned to Leo, his voice cold. “Where is he?”

Leo met his gaze, his heart heavy with the weight of his decision. “I don’t know. I swear, I don’t know.”

The lead agent’s eyes narrowed, but he didn’t press further. Instead, he turned to his partner. “Search the rest of the property. We need to find him.”

As the agents continued their search, Leo stood in the center of the room, his mind a whirlwind of thoughts and fears. He had made a choice, a choice that would change everything. But in that moment, he knew he had done what he had to do. He had protected Poggle, and in doing so, he had taken the first step into a new, uncertain world.
