Tears spilled free, hot and bitter against his cheeks. *This is it. This is the moment I accept that I'm dying.* The realization crushed him, a finality that left him breathless. The world blurred, the sounds of the modern hospital and its gardens fading into the background, replaced by the pounding of his own heart—a relentless drumbeat echoing the urgency of his situation. A deep, shuddering breath filled his lungs, the air tasting of salt and sorrow, a bitter reminder of the life about to be lost. Opening his eyes brought the world back into focus, its colors muted and dull, a reflection of the emptiness inside. On unsteady legs, he stood and began to walk. Each step was a struggle, a battle against the tide of despair threatening to overwhelm him. He didn't know where he was going, only that he needed to move, to keep going, to keep fighting, even if it was a fight he knew he couldn't win.

The hospital gardens stretched out before him, a labyrinth of paths and flowers, a place of beauty and tranquility that seemed to mock the internal chaos. His footsteps echoed in the silence, the only other sound the distant hum of the city—a reminder of the world that would continue without him. Reaching the edge of the gardens, the fence stood as a stark reminder of the boundaries that now confined him. Leaning against the cool metal brought welcome relief to his feverish skin. He looked out at the city, its skyline a jagged silhouette against the sky. *This is the world I'm leaving behind. This is the world that will go on without me.* The thought was a bitter pill, a harsh reality he had to swallow whole.

Closing his eyes released the tears he had been holding back, hot and bitter against his cheeks. *This is it. This is the moment I accept that I'm dying.* The crushing weight of the realization left him breathless. Around him, the world blurred again, the garden sounds fading, replaced by the distant hum of the city—a reminder of the world that would continue. On unsteady legs, he stood and began to walk. Each step was a struggle, a battle against the tide of despair. He didn't know where he was going, only that he needed to move, to keep going, to keep fighting, even if it was a fight he knew he couldn't win.

The labyrinth of paths and flowers stretched before him, its beauty a mockery. His footsteps echoed in the silence, accompanied only by the city's distant hum. At the garden's edge, the fence confined him. The cool metal was a relief against his skin as he leaned and looked out at the jagged silhouette of the skyline. *This is the world I'm leaving behind. This is the world that will go on without me.* A bitter pill, a harsh reality to swallow whole.

Eyes closed, and the held-back tears came, hot and bitter. *This is it. This is the moment I accept that I'm dying.* Breath left him under the crushing finality. The world blurred, the garden fading, replaced by the pounding drumbeat of his own heart. A shuddering breath drew in air that tasted of salt and a life about to be lost. Opening his eyes brought back the muted, dull world, a mirror of inner emptiness. Standing on unsteady legs, he walked. Each step was a struggle against the despair.

His phone buzzed, a sharp vibration against his leg. He ignored it, but it buzzed again. And again. With a trembling hand, he pulled it out. Not a call, but a cascade of notifications—emails from an unknown sender, their subject lines a chilling sequence: CONFIRMATION OF DIAGNOSIS: A67 ANOMALY... PATIENT ZERO: SOURCE IDENTIFIED... YOUR BLOODWORK CONTAINS THE KEY.

The final email’s header was just three words: YOU ARE NOT DYING.

A cold, electric shock severed his despair. He fumbled, opening the message. The text was sparse, clinical. The anomaly in your cells is not degenerative. It is adaptive. You were not infected at the site. You are the site. The initial patient, the carrier, showed no symptoms for eighteen months. You have seventeen. They are watching you. Do not return to your room.

He stared at the screen until the words blurred. The crushing weight of acceptance shattered, replaced by a terrifying, vertiginous lift. He wasn't terminal. He was something else. Something they had locked in a hospital and studied. A sob caught in his throat, not of grief, but of sheer, unadulterated terror. The distant hum of the city wasn't a reminder of a world continuing without him. It was the sound of a world he was now dangerously, irrevocably part of. And they were watching. He slowly turned from the fence, his eyes scanning the dark hospital windows, each one a potential eye. His next breath wasn't salt and sorrow. It was the metallic taste of a new, unimaginable fear.
