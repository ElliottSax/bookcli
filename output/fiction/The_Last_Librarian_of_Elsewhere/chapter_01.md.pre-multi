Chapter 1: The Diagnosis and the Door

Chapter 1: The Diagnosis and the Door

The clock in Dr. Armitage’s office didn’t tick. It was a smooth, silent orb of brushed steel, its digital numbers flipping over with a soft, guiltless sigh. Leo watched it change from 10:14 to 10:15. A minute, gone. He was now a minute closer to the end, and the clock hadn’t even made a sound about it.

“Leo,” Dr. Armitage said, her voice carefully sanded of all its rough edges. She leaned forward, her hands folded on the immaculate desk blotter. They were good hands, capable and clean. “The new scans are conclusive. The treatment… it’s bought us time, but it’s no longer viable. The progression is too aggressive.”

Leo already knew. He’d felt it in the deep, cold ache that had taken up permanent residence in his bones, in the way his breath sometimes hitched and forgot how to start again. He’d known when he caught his reflection in the subway window yesterday—a ghost with his face, all sharp angles and shadowed hollows. But hearing it said aloud in this quiet, sunlit room made it real in a new, irrevocable way. The air smelled of lemony disinfectant and, faintly, of her jasmine hand cream.

“How much time?” His own voice surprised him. It was calm, a librarian’s voice used to asking for a specific volume.

Dr. Armitage didn’t flinch, but her eyes, the colour of weak tea, softened with a professional pity that was worse than anger. “Weeks. Perhaps six. Eight if we’re very fortunate. I’m so sorry.”

Weeks. The word didn’t feel big enough. It was a thimble trying to hold an ocean. He thought of the towering, precarious stacks of books in his archive, the un-catalogued boxes, the mysteries he’d spent a lifetime collecting, hoping to one day solve. He’d need decades. He had weeks.

“I see,” Leo said. He stood, the movement a little too quick, and a wave of dizziness made him grip the back of the chair. The leather was cool and slightly sticky under his palm. “Thank you for your candor, Doctor.”

“Leo, we have options for palliative care. There are things we can do to ensure comfort—”

“Of course. I’ll be in touch.” He was already moving toward the door, needing to be away from the sanitized certainty of the room. He fumbled with the handle, a sleek brass lever that yielded too easily.

The city outside was a jarring symphony of life. The late April sun was weak but persistent, glinting off the windshields of gridlocked taxis. The air was thick with the smell of pretzel carts, exhaust, and the damp, mineral scent of impending rain. People streamed past him—a woman laughing into her phone, a deliveryman cursing at a locked door, a child dragging a balloon shaped like a dinosaur. Their lives stretched out before them, vast and unknowable. His had just been measured, folded neatly into a span of days that could be counted on two hands.

He didn’t take the subway. He walked the twenty-three blocks to his building, each step a deliberate act of defiance against the fatigue that clung to him like a sodden coat. His apartment building, “The Albatross,” was a stubborn, soot-stained brick relic wedged between two glass-and-steel giants. The lobby smelled of old carpet and cabbage. Mrs. Gunderson in 2B was arguing with her cat again, her voice a tinny screech through the floorboards as he passed.

His own door, 4R, was unmarked. He unlocked it and stepped into the silence.

It wasn’t just quiet; it was a dense, velvety hush, absorbed by the thousands of volumes, curios, and artifacts that filled every conceivable inch of space. This was his archive, his life’s work. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves bowed under the weight of esoteric texts. Piles of leather-bound journals formed miniature skyscrapers on the Persian rug, its pattern long obscured. Glass cabinets held geological oddities, rusted clockwork mechanisms, and fragments of pottery from forgotten digs. A stuffed owl with slightly mismatched glass eyes watched sternly from atop a wardrobe bursting with maps. The air was a familiar perfume of dust, decaying paper, beeswax polish, and the faint, sweet tang of old leather.

Leo shrugged off his jacket, letting it fall to the floor. The pretense of order, of normalcy, was over. He moved through the labyrinthine pathways of his home, his fingers trailing over spines: A Treatise on the Spectral Cartography of the 14th Century, The Unconfirmed Flora of the Blackwald, Personal Diaries of Alistair Finch, Vol. VII. His legacy. Soon to be dispersed, sold off by indifferent relatives, or worse, hauled to the curb by sanitation workers who wouldn’t look twice.

He reached his desk, a great, scarred oak beast buried under a landslide of papers. And there, serving as a paperweight for a stack of unsorted correspondence, was the Compass.

It was his great-uncle Alistair’s, the man who had first inspired his obsession with the uncatalogued world. It wasn’t a navigational instrument. Its face was not marked with cardinal directions but with strange, swirling glyphs that seemed to shift if you stared at them too long. The needle, a sliver of smoky crystal, never pointed north. It quivered, perpetually restless, as if trying to settle on a destination that didn’t exist in this world. Alistair’s final, rambling letter had accompanied it: “For Leo, who might understand. It doesn’t point to places, my boy. It points to possibilities. Or perhaps to doors. I never had the knack.”

Leo had never had the knack either. For forty-seven years, he’d treated it as a curious heirloom, a metaphor made brass. Now, he picked it up. It was heavier than it looked, cold against his feverish skin. The crystal needle spun lazily.

The weight of the day—the clinical finality of the prognosis, the bustling indifference of the city, the sheer, crushing volume of all he would never know—descended on him all at once. It was a physical pressure in his chest, a hot, tight knot behind his eyes. He wasn’t ready. He would never be ready. All these books, all these stories, all these whispers of other worlds and hidden truths… and he would be the last one to hear them. The final, failing librarian of a library no one else believed existed.

A sound escaped him, a raw, choked gasp that was part sob, part fury. He gripped the Compass until the intricate metal edges bit into his palm. He wasn’t praying. He was protesting. A silent, furious scream directed at the universe: It’s not enough time!

As the wave of despair crested, the Compass grew warm. Not pleasantly warm, but with a sudden, internal heat that made him gasp. The glyphs on its face began to glow, a soft, phosphorescent blue. The crystal needle stopped its wandering and stood rigid, pointing directly at the blank wall between a bookcase on Pre-Columbian myth and a cabinet of luminescent fungi samples.

A vibration began in the air, a sub-audible hum that made his teeth ache. The papers on his desk fluttered. The glass eyes of the stuffed owl seemed to gleam.

Leo stared, his personal anguish momentarily eclipsed by shock. A line of light appeared in the air where the needle pointed, a vertical seam of brilliant, impossible blue. It widened with a sound like tearing silk and cracking ice, peeling open a hole in the very fabric of his study.

It wasn’t a window. It was a portal. Through it, he saw not his building’s opposite wall, but a chaotic, twilight landscape. Jagged, purple-black peaks scraped a bruised orange sky. Strange, twisted trees with silver bark writhed in a wind he could not feel. The air that washed through carried a scent like ozone, damp earth, and something metallic, like blood.

He stood frozen, the Compass a burning brand in his hand. The portal shimmered, unstable, its edges crackling with wild energy.

Then, something moved in that other place. A small, frantic shape barreled out of the twisted foliage, heading straight for the tear in reality. It was being pursued; Leo could see larger, hulking shadows crashing through the silver trees behind it.

The small figure leapt.

It tumbled through the portal with a yelp, a compact bundle of rags and sharp limbs. The moment it cleared the threshold, the portal gave a violent, shuddering pulse. The Compass in Leo’s hand went ice-cold and inert. With a final, deafening snap, the seam sealed itself shut. The wall was just a wall again, lined with books.

Silence rushed back in, deeper and more profound than before.

On the floor, amidst the dust motes dancing in a sudden sunbeam from the window, the creature uncurled.

It was about three feet tall, with skin the colour and texture of a dried mushroom. Its ears were large, pointed, and twitched erratically. It wore a patched tunic and leggings, and it was clutching a book to its narrow chest like a shield. The book was ancient, its leather cover cracked and stained, its pages edged in flaking gold.

The creature—a goblin, Leo’s mind supplied, the word rising from a thousand fairy tales and marginalia—looked around with wide, amber eyes that held a galaxy of terror. It took in the towering books, the strange artifacts, the stuffed owl, and finally, Leo, who stood statue-still, the useless Compass dangling from his fingers.

The goblin’s gaze locked onto the Compass. Its fear seemed to crystallize into a sharp, knowing dread. It hugged its book tighter, its thin shoulders shaking. It had a sharp, intelligent face, etched with lines that spoke of hard travel and constant fear.

Its voice, when it came, was a dry rasp, like leaves skittering on stone. It spoke in a language Leo had never heard, yet he understood it perfectly, the meaning unfolding directly in his mind.

“You…” it whispered, its eyes huge. “You opened a stable door. From this side.”

It swallowed, a difficult click in its thin throat. It looked from Leo’s face to the Compass and back again, and a terrible pity mixed with its own fear.

“You’re a Key,” it said, the words heavy with finality. “They’ll be coming for you now.”

Leo could only stare, the doctor’s words—“Weeks, perhaps six”—echoing in the new, vast, and terrifying silence.
