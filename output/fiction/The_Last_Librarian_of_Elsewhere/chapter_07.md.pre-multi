Chapter 7: The Broken Cage

The silence after the blast was thick and humming, a physical thing. It wasn’t an absence of sound, but a replacement: the groan of stressed metal, the fizzle of dying electronics, the drip-drip-drip of broken pipes. And beneath it all, a chorus of new, strange voices—screeches, chitters, low rumbling bellows—all suddenly freed.

Leo’s world came back from a white-hot pain into a dim, crimson emergency glow. He was on the floor, the polished concrete cold against his cheek. The air tasted of ozone and burnt cinnamon—Cogsworth’s final scent. The extraction chamber was a ruin. The humming glass cylinder that had held him was now a spiderweb of cracks, weeping a clear, viscous fluid. The restraints on the table had retracted, their cruel intelligence gone.

Cogsworth.

He pushed himself up, his body protesting. Where the owl had been, a small, blackened sphere sat on the floor, trailing a wisp of smoke. Its gentle, golden light was out. Around it, a perfect circle of floor was untouched, as if the little librarian had contained his whole end inside himself.

A sob hitched in Leo’s throat, but a guttural roar from a nearby cell strangled it. A slab of reinforced polymer, webbed with cracks, shuddered under a heavy impact. Thump. Thump.

He scrambled to his feet. The main door was sealed, a red “X” glowing on its control panel. But the blast had buckled the wall beside it, peeling back a section of alloy plating like a tin can lid. Beyond was darkness, threaded with the crimson emergency strips.

He didn’t think. He just moved. Squeezing through the jagged opening, he entered a service corridor. The chaos was immense. Alarms whooped in conflicting rhythms. Automated voices droned, “Containment breach. Sector Seven. Quarantine protocol failed.” Through grated vents overhead, he saw flashes of iridescent scales and heard the leathery flap of impossible wings. A creature made of swirling shadow and angry violet eyes poured down a cross-corridor, and the temperature dropped ten degrees as it passed.

Leo pressed his back against the wall, heart hammering. He was a librarian from a town that no longer existed, hiding in a duct from a nightmare. He thought of his quiet library, the dust motes dancing in sunbeams, the smell of old paper. The memory was a pinprick of light in the visceral dark.

He had to find the others. Bryn. Poggle. The thought of them, alone in this unleashed menagerie, pushed him forward.

He followed the path of greatest destruction—Cogsworth’s parting gift. Conduits hung like severed veins, sparking. He passed cells whose doors had blown clean off. In one, a creature of living crystal sat perfectly still, refracting the alarm lights into a tiny, beautiful rainbow on the opposite wall. In another, a pool of silvery liquid was slowly, deliberately dissolving the security camera watching it.

An intersection offered three choices. Left, right, or a maintenance shaft
