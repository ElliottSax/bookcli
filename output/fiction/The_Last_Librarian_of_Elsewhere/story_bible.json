  "plot_summary": "A terminally ill man named Leo, in a moment of utter despair in a hospital garden, is transported to or chosen by 'The Stacks,' a sentient, cross-dimensional library. Instead of dying, he becomes its new Librarian and cornerstone. The story follows his transformation from a dying man to the guardian of a magical sanctuary. He builds a found family with other displaced beings (Cogsworth, Bryn, Poggle) and learns that his magic is one of gentle intention, curation, and affirmation. The climax is not a battle, but a moment of peaceful integration: Leo inscribing the core truths of his new life\u2014'Family, Found. Sanctuary, Shared. Story, Continuing.'\u2014into the very fabric of the library, solidifying his place and purpose. The ending is a quiet, joyful beginning, focused on the ongoing work and wonder of his eternal role."
