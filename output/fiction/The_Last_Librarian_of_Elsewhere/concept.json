To survive, he must unite a ragtag band of exiled magical beings he accidentally summoned to his dying world: a guilt-ridden warrior, a starving poet-goblin, and a sentient, melancholic clockwork owl. Together, they must find the mythical 'Stacks of Avalon,' a library at the heart of all realities, not just to save their own worlds, but to redefine what family means when you're literally from different dimensions.",
