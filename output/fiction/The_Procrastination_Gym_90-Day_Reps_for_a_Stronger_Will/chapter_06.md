now. Thinner. Like a mist that’s been stirred, not a wall that’s been broken.
The Second Attempt: A Journal Entry

This time, I sit on the floor. The wood is cool under my palms. I press them flat, feel the grain. There’s a knot in the wood, a swirl of darker brown. I trace it with my finger. The edges are smooth, but the center is rough, like a tiny mountain. I wonder how long it’s been there. The house is quiet. The air smells like coffee, but not fresh. Old coffee. The kind that lingers in the air after the pot’s been empty for hours. I hear a car door slam outside. A dog barks. The sound is sharp, then fades. I don’t think about the email. I don’t think about the project. I just… am. The timer goes off. I stand up. My legs are stiff. I stretch, roll my shoulders. The fog is gone. Not just thinner. Gone. Like it was never there.
The Third Attempt: A Journal Entry

I’m in the kitchen. The light is different here. Harsher. The counter is white, but not clean. A smear of something—jam?—is drying in the corner. I wipe it with my thumb. It’s sticky. I lick it. Sweet. Raspberry, maybe. The fridge hums. I listen to it. The sound is steady, rhythmic. Like a heartbeat. My own breath is slower now. I close my eyes. The light behind my lids is orange. I think of sunsets. The beach. The sound of waves. The smell of salt. I’m not there, but I can almost feel it. The timer buzzes. I open my eyes. The kitchen is still here. But I’m different. Ready.
The Fourth Attempt: A Journal Entry

I’m sitting on the couch. The fabric is soft, worn. I run my fingers over it. The pattern is faded. I can’t remember what color it was when it was new. The light from the window is slanted. It cuts across the reader's own mind and daily environments (bedroom, The reader's own mind and daily environments (bedroom, home office, The reader's own mind and daily environments (bedroom, home office, workspace)), The reader's own mind and daily environments (bedroom, home office, workspace)), a golden blade. I watch the dust in it. It’s not floating. It’s falling. Slowly. Like snow. I don’t think about anything. I simply watch. The timer goes off. I stand up. I stretch. I walk back to my desk. The fog is gone. Not just gone. It’s like it was never there.
The Fifth Attempt: A Journal Entry

I’m sitting on the floor again. The wood is warm now. The sun has moved. I can feel it on my back. I lean into it. The heat is steady. It’s not burning. It’merelyst… there. I close my eyes. I listen to my breath. In. Out. In. Out. The timer goes off. I open my eyes. I stand up. The fog is gone. Not just gone.
The Sixth Attempt: A Journal Entry

I’m sitting on the floor. The wood is warm. The sun is on my back. I close my eyes. I listen to my breath. In. Out. In. Out. The timer goes off. I open my eyes. I stand up. The fog is gone. onlyjust gone.
