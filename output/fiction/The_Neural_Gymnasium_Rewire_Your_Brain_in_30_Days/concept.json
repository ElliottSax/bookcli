  "genre": "self_help",
  "subgenre": "psychology",
  "premise": "What if you could treat your mind not as a mysterious entity, but as a physical muscle you can train with targeted, daily exercises? This book presents a revolutionary, evidence-based system of 'neurosculpting' workouts\u2014short, potent mental drills designed to physically reshape neural pathways, turning anxiety into resilience, procrastination into flow, and self-doubt into confidence.",
  "protagonist": "The Reader, framed as the 'Head Coach' of their own brain, guided by the book's science-backed protocols.",
  "conflict": "The central struggle is against the brain's default, often unhelpful, wiring\u2014the automatic loops of negative thinking, fear-based responses, and ingrained habits. The conflict is an internal, daily battle to consciously forge new neural trails against the powerful pull of the old, familiar ones.",
  "setting": "Contemporary, everyday life; the 'gym' is the reader's own mind, activated in moments throughout their normal day\u2014during a commute, in a meeting, before sleep.",
