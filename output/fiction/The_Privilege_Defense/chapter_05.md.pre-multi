Chapter 5: The Trap Closes

The invitation didn't arrive on paper—it came as a command. A sleek, silent town car picked Elena up at midnight, the driver a slab of a man with empty eyes. All he said was, “Mr. Thorne insists.” The argument she’d rehearsed died in her throat. When he insisted, it was a physical thing, a pressure in the air.

For an hour they drove into a darkness so complete it felt solid. Then, over a hill, the estate appeared: a monstrous Georgian revival of pale stone, every window blazing, floating in the black countryside like a doomed ship. It wasn’t a house so much as a statement of power. The Aegis Gathering.

The masquerade was in full, grotesque swing. The grand ballroom swam with the smell of gardenias, expensive cigars, and the sharper tang of ambition. Men in tuxedos and simple domino masks held court, their laughter a low, confident rumble. Beside them, always a step behind, stood their companions—stunningly beautiful men and women, eyes a little too wide, laughter a beat too quick. The ‘protected.’ They moved with rehearsed grace, human ornaments. Elena, in her plain black dress and the simple mask she’d been handed at the door—a lawyer’s uniform in disguise—felt like a scribble on a masterpiece.

“Choice is a luxury for the uncommitted.” He smiled, guiding her through the crowd with a hand on the small of her back. The gesture burned. “Tonight is about seeing the architecture of the world, Elena. Not the drywall everyone else sees.”

And she saw it. A Senator, laughing loudly, his hand on the shoulder of a young man with a glassy, frightened smile. A media titan debating antitrust law with the judge overseeing his subsidiary’s case. Every conversation was a thread of soft power.

“—the asset in Milan has gotten volatile. Needs a gentle relocation.”
“—the audit problem is resolved. The fire was… unfortunate, but thorough.”
“—she’s asking for a narrative adjustment. I’ve assigned a storyteller.”

The euphemisms were polished stones, smooth and deadly. Elena’s legal mind, trained for precision, recoiled. Asset. Problem. Storyteller. Termination. Each one landed with a soft, sickening thud in her gut.

Thorne led her to a quieter alcove. A server, eyes down, offered a tray. Thorne took two glasses of deep amber liquor. He h
