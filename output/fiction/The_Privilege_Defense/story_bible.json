  "narrative_voice": "Close third-person, predominantly from Elara's perspective. The prose is sharp, forensic, and atmospheric, mirroring a legal mind dissecting reality. It is laden with sensory detail (sound, pressure, texture) to convey psychological states. Internal thoughts are often presented as cold, analytical observations that gradually fracture under emotional weight.",
  "tone": "Claustrophobic, tense, and morally gray. Begins with a polished, clinical chill that slowly descends into paranoia, exhaustion, and grim determination. The tone is one of relentless pressure, with moments of stark, visceral emotion breaking through a controlled surface.",
  "plot_summary": "After securing a 'not guilty' verdict for her privileged client, Julian Croft, using every technicality and societal advantage at her disposal, defense attorney Elara Vance is haunted by the human cost. When new, damning evidence emerges post-verdict\u2014evidence she suspects Croft concealed\u2014her professional certainty shatters. Pursuing this truth pits her against her own firm, the legal system designed to protect finality, and a now-untouchable and dangerous client. Elara's investigation transforms from a quest for personal absolution into a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, leading her to an alliance with the very people her victory devastated. The climax is not in a courtroom, but in a grim transaction of acknowledgment on the courthouse steps. Ultimately exiled from her old life, Elara walks away carrying the poisonous knowledge of the system's rot, positioning her\u2014in the final chilling realization\u2014as the one person who might truly understand how to dismantle it from the outside.",
