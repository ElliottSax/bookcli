Chapter 8: Client Confidentiality

Chapter 8: Client Confidentiality

The air in her office had turned to glass. Each breath Elara took felt sharp, dangerous, a potential shatter. Julian’s civil suit papers lay on her desk, not as sheets of paper but as scalpels, meticulously dissecting her life. Malpractice. Gross negligence. Financial ruin. The words buzzed like wasps trapped under her skin. Her friend Maya was in the hospital, a concussion and two broken ribs, the result of a “random” mugging that had stolen only her phone—the phone with all her messages to Elara. The police had offered sympathetic noises and empty promises. Julian’s shadow was long, and it drank the light.

Leo’s voice, crackling through a burner phone, had been the final straw. “The entrapment plan is ash, Elara. He’s expecting it. He’s anticipating every legal move. You can’t beat him in his arena.”

“Then I go to his basement,” she’d whispered, the taste of copper on her tongue.

Now, she stood before the wall-safe behind a framed lithograph of Lady Justice. Her fingers, cold and clumsy, dialed the combination. The ethical imperative—Client Confidentiality—screamed in her head, a mantra beaten into her from her first day of law school. The sanctity of the attorney-client privilege was the bedrock. It was what separated them from the animals. But the animals were at the door, and they had the keys to The gritty, impersonal streets and dive bars where truth lingers.

The safe door swung open with a sigh of stale, chilled air. Inside, neat, color-coded binders held the festering secrets of the wealthy and the wicked. She bypassed the tax evaders, the corrupt officials, the adulterous CEOs. Her hand went unerringly to the black binder, marked only with a case number. Vex, Marcus.

Marcus Vex was a crime lord, a man who had built an empire on synthetic opioids and extortion. She’d been his court-appointed defender on a minor RICO charge three years ago—minor for him, a potential life sentence for anyone else. She’d gotten him a deal: seven years, with parole possible in five. He’d been amused by her, this pale, intense woman who argued the law with the fervor of a priestess. “You have a spine, counselor,” he’d said, his voice a gravel road. “Unusual in your breed.”

She’d kept the file because Vex had hinted, over their many privileged conversations, at the “legitimate” fronts he used to launder money and influence. One name had surfaced more than once: Aegis Security Solutions. Julian’s pet firm, the one that provided his personal guards, the one that had, according to Leo’s digging, handled “peripheral asset denial” for Julian’s business rivals. A euphemism. Always a euphemism.

She opened the binder. Photographs of Vex stared back: a face like a weathered cliff, dark eyes that held no reflection. Notes in her own precise handwriting detailed his operations. And there, on a yellow legal pad, a scribbled aside from a client meeting: Vex mentions Aegis did ‘wetwork’ for a ‘new money prince’ in the tech sector. J. Julian Thorne?

The connection was a live wire. She had to pull it.

Blackstone Penitentiary smelled of industrial bleach, stale sweat, and a deeper, more profound despair—the scent of time being served in slow, rotting increments. The visiting room was a symphony of claustrophobia: low, water-stained ceilings, fluorescent lights that hummed like angry insects, and the constant, jarring clang of metal doors. Elara sat at a small, bolted-down table, her suit feeling like a costume. She was a lawyer, but she wasn’t here as his lawyer. The distinction was a canyon, and she was free-falling.

Marcus Vex entered with a quiet authority that silenced the room. He was older, his hair gone steel-gray, but he moved with a predator’s economy. The orange jumpsuit hung on him like a joke. His eyes found her, and a smile touched his lips—not warm, but recognizing, like a mathematician spotting a useful variable.

“Counselor Elena Vance Vance,” he said, settling into the chair opposite. His cuffs rattled, a dull percussion. “To what do I owe the honor? My appeals are exhausted. You got me my deal. We’re square.”

The air was thick, hard to breathe. “This isn’t about your case, Mr. Vex.”

“No?” He leaned forward, the table creaking. “Then it’s a social call. I don’t get many.”

“It’s about Aegis Security. And Julian Julian Thorne.”

All amusement vanished from his face. The temperature in the room seemed to drop. “Dangerous names. In here, and out there.”

“Julian Thorne is trying to destroy me. He’s using the law, the police, his money. He’s had people hurt.” Her voice threatened to break. She locked it down. “You told me once, under privilege, that Aegis did more than security for him. You called it ‘wetwork.’”

Vex stared at her, his gaze weighing her desperation. “Privilege still applies, counselor. Even now. So you can ask, and I can tell you, and the walls have no ears. Officially.” He let the word hang. “Why should I?”

“I can file a motion for sentence reduction. New testimony on prosecutorial overreach in your case. I can shave a year, maybe two, off your time.”

He laughed, a sound like stones grinding. “A year? For poking a bear like Julian Thorne? He owns half the guards in this block. My life isn’t worth a year.” He started to rise.

“What if it wasn’t just about testifying?” The words rushed out, a breach in the dam. “What if you had proof? Something I could use without you ever taking the stand.”

Vex paused, halfway out of his chair. He slowly sat back down. His eyes were black pools, absorbing all light. “Proof.”

“You recorded things,” Elara pressed, gambling everything. “You told me you always kept insurance. For your ‘legitimate’ partners.”

A long, silent minute passed. The guard coughed. A baby cried somewhere in the general visitation area, a sound shockingly out of place.

“Julian Thorne came to Aegis for a problem,” Vex said, his voice so low she had to strain to hear. “A co-founder. A man who was going to take his company public in a way Julian Thorne didn’t like. A moralist. Julian Thorne wanted it to look like an accident. Aegis provided the… accident. But Julian Thorne was nervous. Paranoid. He wanted to oversee the initial planning. He came to a warehouse we used in the Docklands. He thought he was anonymous. He wasn’t.”

Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs. “You have a recording.”

“I have a video. Audio is crystal. His face is clear. He’s discussing the mark’s schedule, his habits. He suggests the brake lines on the mark’s car. ‘A tragic, mechanical failure.’” Vex mimicked a bland, executive tone perfectly. It was more terrifying than a shout.

The hook was in her flesh, pulling her forward. “I need it.”

“Of course you do.” Vex smiled again, but it was all teeth. “And my price just went up. A year off my sentence is an insult.”

“What do you want?”

“I want my brother out.”

“Your brother’s serving fifteen for armed assault and attempted murder. I can’t—”

“Not my blood brother. My right hand. Silas Rourke. He’s in Hillside Pen, on a trumped-up weapons charge. The DA overcharged, you know it. The search was questionable. You’re a hell of a lawyer, counselor. You can get it tossed. You get Silas walking, I give you the recording that puts Julian Julian Thorne in a cage for the rest of his miserable life.”

The world narrowed to the scarred table between them. To trade one monster for another. To use her skill, her knowledge of the law—the very institution she was trying to uphold—to spring a violent criminal. Silas Rourke had a reputation that made guards nervous. He was not a man who would walk into the light and repent.

“I can’t… that’s not a deal, that’s corruption.”

“No,” Vex corrected softly. “It’s a transaction. You came to me, counselor. You opened the black book. You don’t get to be shocked by what’s written inside.” He leaned in, his breath smelling of cheap coffee and mint. “Julian Thorne will kill you. Slowly. He’ll take everything you love first, then your mind, then your life. He’s a artist of misery. I’m just a businessman. Silas for Julian Thorne. It’s a good trade.”

The claustrophobia of the room became absolute. The walls pressed in, the hum of the lights was inside her skull. She saw Maya’s bruised face. She saw Julian’s smug, untouchable expression in The austere, high-stakes courtrooms of a major metropolitan city. She saw the abyss.

“How do I know you have the recording?”

“You don’t. But you know I have the means, and the reason, to have it. And you’re out of options.” He stood, this time definitively. “Think on it. But don’t think too long. Julian Thorne’s wheels turn faster than your conscience.”

He turned to go, then glanced back. “One more thing. Privilege still holds. This conversation never happened. Until you’re ready to deal.”

He was led away, a king returning to his shabby domain.

The drive back to The gritty, impersonal streets and dive bars where truth lingers was a blur of rain-smeared asphalt and her own ragged reflection in the windshield. She felt contaminated. The ghost of Vex’s offer sat in the passenger seat, a presence more solid than the leather.

Back in her apartment—a space that no longer felt like a sanctuary, just another potential crime scene—she poured a whiskey she didn’t drink. The ice cracked, sounding like breaking bones. Leo’s latest message blinked on her encrypted laptop: “He’s filed for an immediate freeze on your assets. Hearing in 48 hours. If it goes through, you can’t pay rent, let alone a defense.”

The law was a sieve, and she was slipping through.

She opened the file on Silas Rourke. The case was, as Vex said, fragile. An anonymous tip. A traffic stop that escalated. A search based on “furtive movement.” The gun was found, but the chain of custody had a gap a good lawyer could drive a truck through. The arresting officer had a history of complaints. It was winnable. She could write the motion to suppress in her sleep. It would be a masterpiece of legal reasoning.

And if she won, a man who allegedly beat a shopkeeper nearly to death for protection money would walk free.

She thought of the victim, an old man named Chen. His statement was in the file: “He told me next time he wouldn’t stop. He said he’d make sure my wife found me.”

Her professional mind compartmentalized it: the officer’s misconduct poisoned the tree, the fruit was inadmissible. Justice required the rules be followed. But this wasn’t justice. This was barter. She would be using the rules not to uphold justice, but to purchase a weapon.

She opened a blank document. Her fingers hovered over the keys. The first line of the motion to suppress the evidence in State v. Rourke was the easiest thing in the world to write, and the hardest.

She typed: “COMES NOW the Defendant, by and through his attorney, Elena Vance Vance…”

The lie was in the designation. She wasn’t his attorney. She was his broker.

The work consumed her. For hours, she was just a lawyer again, crafting arguments, citing precedents, building a flawless, amoral edifice of procedure. It was a relief to be in that pure, logical space. It was a horror to know its purpose.

As dawn bled grey light into the room, she finished. The motion was a thing of terrible beauty. It would work.

She sent a message, through the secure channel Vex had given her—a numbered email address that felt like dropping a letter into a void. “The motion is drafted. It will be filed today. I need proof of the asset.”

The reply came an hour later, as she sat staring at the cold cup of coffee. No words. Just an audio file attachment.

Her hand trembled as she clicked it.

First, the sound of rain on a corrugated metal roof. Then, the squeak of a door. Footsteps.

A voice she knew intimately, the voice that haunted her dreams, smooth and confident: “—reliability is the issue. The daily commute on Route 9. The mountain pass section. The drop-off is severe. A brake failure there is… tragic, but plausible.”

Another voice, rougher, professional: “We can engineer it. Clean. No traces.”

Julian’s voice again: “See that you do. The company’s future depends on this clean transition. He’s a sentimentalist. He’ll ruin us all.”

“Understood, Mr. Julian Thorne.”

A pause. The sound of a briefcase clicking open. “Half now. Half on confirmation.”

“Pleasure doing business.”

The audio ended.

Elara vomited into her kitchen sink, the acid burning her throat. It was real. Julian’s voice, coldly planning murder. The proof was in her hand. It was a key. A key purchased with a soul.

She filed the motion for Silas Rourke at 9:01 AM. By 10:30, she had received a notification: a hearing was set for the end of the week. The system, oblivious, ground forward.

Leo met her in a park, by a frozen pond. “You look like hell,” he said, his own face drawn.

“I’m in it,” she said. She played him a snippet of the audio. His face went pale.

“My God. That’s it. That’s the whole game. We give this to the right DA…”

“There’s a condition,” she interrupted, her voice hollow. “The source. He demanded a price. I’ve… I’ve already started paying it.”

Leo listened as she explained about Rourke. His expression shifted from shock to dawning horror. “Elara… you can’t. That’s not a line you cross. It’s a cliff you jump off.”

“What’s the alternative?” she hissed, the numbness giving way to a raw, frayed anger. “Let Julian win? Let him own everything? He’s already hurting people I love! This is the only weapon he doesn’t own!”

“It’s a weapon that will blow up in your face. If you get Rourke out, and he hurts someone else, that blood is on your hands. It’s not a metaphor. It’s real, warm blood.” He grabbed her shoulders. “There has to be another way.”

“There isn’t!” she cried, pulling away. The sound echoed across the icy pond. “Don’t you see? He’s thought of everything legal. This is the only move left on the board. It’s the only move he wouldn’t expect from the privileged, ethical Elena Vance Vance.”

Leo looked at her as if seeing a stranger. “Is that who you are anymore?”

She had no answer.

The hearing for the asset freeze was a grotesque pantomime. Julian’s lawyer, a sleek shark in a five-thousand-dollar suit, painted her as incompetent, reckless, a danger to her clients. She defended herself mechanically, her mind a thousand miles away, in a prison visiting room and a Docklands warehouse. The judge, an old man with tired eyes, seemed sympathetic but bound by procedure. He granted a temporary freeze, pending a full hearing. She was functionally penniless.

As she walked out of The austere, high-stakes courtrooms of a major metropolitan city, the winter air felt like a slap. Julian was waiting on the steps, surrounded by a phalanx of Aegis men.

“Elara,” he said, his voice dripping with false pity. “A terrible ruling. I do hope you have the resources to mount a proper defense. It would be a shame if you had to concede for… financial reasons.”

She stopped, turning to face him. The recording felt like a live coal in her pocket. She saw the original murder in his eyes, the one he’d ordered, and the new one he was planning for her. She didn’t feel fear anymore. She felt a cold, clear fury.

“You’ve forgotten something, Julian.”

“Oh?” He raised an eyebrow, amused. “What’s that?”

“You hired professionals,” she said, her voice barely a whisper, but it carried in the still air. “But you never asked who their other clients were.”

A flicker. A tiny, almost imperceptible crack in the marble facade. Doubt. It was there and gone, but she saw it. He hadn’t expected that. He hadn’t accounted for the connections in the dark.

“Enjoy your victory,” she said, walking past him. “It’s your last one.”

She didn’t look back. She went straight to her office. The Rourke hearing was tomorrow. She had to be perfect. She was preparing to sell the last of her professional soul when her cell phone buzzed—the real one, not the burner.

It was a number she didn’t recognize. She answered.

A voice, rough with tears and a fury that mirrored her own, came through. It was Anya, the wife of the murdered co-founder, the original victim. Her words came in a frantic, terrified rush.

“Elena Vance? He was here. Julian’s men. They said they were doing a ‘security review.’ They took things. They took my husband’s old laptop. The one the police never found. I hid it. They knew. How did they know?”

Elara’s blood turned to ice. “What was on it, Anya?”

“Everything. His journals. His suspicions about Julian. And… and the files he kept on the company’s early funding. The illegal sources. Julian’s name is all over them.”

Julian wasn’t just covering up a murder. He was erasing the foundation of his entire fortune. And he knew, somehow, that Elara was getting close to a different angle of attack. He was cleaning house.

“Anya, listen to me. Get out of your house. Go to a hotel. Use cash. Don’t tell anyone where you are. I’ll call you back.”

She hung up, her mind racing. The laptop was a second front, a new battlefield. Julian had it now. But Anya had seen it, knew what it contained. She was a witness. A target.

The door to her office opened silently. Leo stood there, his face ashen. He didn’t speak, just held up his phone. On the screen was a news alert: BREAKING: Inmate Silas Rourke Granted Surprise Bail Hearing After New Motion Filed.

It was already happening. The machine she had set in motion was grinding forward. She had one devil’s recording in her hand, another devil about to be unleashed on The gritty, impersonal streets and dive bars where truth lingers, and a desperate widow who held the secret that could burn Julian’s world down—if she lived long enough to tell it.

The hook was no longer in her flesh. It was in her spine, and it was pulling her into a deeper, darker current. She had wanted a weapon. Now she had two. And both were aimed directly back at her heart.
