Chapter 7: Fruit of the Poisonous Tree

Chapter 7: Fruit of the Poisonous Tree

The call came at 3:17 a.m. A number she didn’t recognize, cutting through the thin, anxious sleep she’d finally fallen into. Elara fumbled for the phone, her mouth tasting of stale coffee and fear.

“Hello?”

A stranger’s voice, officious and calm. “Is this Elena Vance Vance? This is Officer Mendes, Seattle PD. We’re at Harborview Medical Center. A woman named Maya Rodriguez has been admitted. You’re listed as her emergency contact.”

The world telescoped down to the cold plastic in her hand. “What happened?”

“She was assaulted. She’s stable, but she asked for you.”

The drive was a smear of rain-slicked darkness and the acid-green glow of dashboard lights. Elara’s hands were welded to the steering wheel, knuckles white. Not Maya. Please, not Maya. Maya, who brought her homemade tamales when she was drowning in briefs. Maya, who had laughed, just two days ago, about setting Elara up with her “too-nice” cousin. “You need someone boring, Ellie. A human Xanax.”

The ICU was a symphony of sterile dread: the hiss of ventilators, the beep of heart monitors, the soft squeak of rubber-soled shoes on linoleum. The smell of antiseptic couldn’t mask the underlying scent of human frailty—sweat, blood, and bleach.

Maya looked small, swallowed by the mechanical bed. A bandage wrapped her head, purpling bruises bloomed around her eyes, and her left arm was in a cast. Wires snaked from her body to blinking machines. But her eyes were open. They found Elara, and they were not just scared. They were haunted.

“Maya.” Elara’s voice cracked. She took her friend’s uninjured hand, careful of the IV. It was cold.

Maya’s lips, dry and cracked, moved. The sound was a rasp. “He… whispered.”

Elara leaned closer, her own blood roaring in her ears. “Who, sweetie? Who did this?”

“Didn’t see… his face. Mask.” A tear traced a path through the bruising on her temple. “But he whispered… in my ear. Before he… he said, ‘A flawed vessel… cannot hold the truth.’”

The floor dropped away. Elara’s breath left her in a rush. The words were a direct, vicious quote from Julian’s original trial. The philosophical justification he’d given, in his chillingly calm testimony, for silencing his first victim—a graduate student who had threatened to expose his plagiarized thesis. “She was a flawed vessel. Corrupted by envy. I merely… stopped the noise.”

“Julian,” Elara breathed, the name a curse.

Maya’s fingers tightened weakly around hers. “He kept saying… ‘Tell Elara… the system is a sieve.’” She began to shake, a full-body tremor that made the bed rattle. A nurse appeared, her expression professionally sympathetic but her eyes flicking to Elara with a trace of suspicion.

“I need to speak to the officer,” Elara said, her voice hollow.

Officer Mendes was in the harshly lit family lounge, a young man with tired eyes, sipping vending machine coffee. He listened as Elara spilled it out—Julian Julian Thorne, the acquittal, the threat, the civil suit, the quote.

He took notes, but his demeanor remained frustratingly neutral. “We’re aware of Mr. Julian Thorne. Ms. Rodriguez’s apartment was broken into with a key. No prints. No DNA at the scene besides the victim’s. The quote is… suggestive. But it’s not evidence. You say he threatened you personally?”

“Yes! He said, ‘You’ll see the consequences of your choices.’”

“And you have a recording? A witness?”

“It was in his penthouse! It was implied.”

Mendes closed his notebook with a soft snap. “We’ll talk to him, of course. But without forensic evidence placing him at the scene, or a direct witnessed threat, it’s circumstantial. He has high-powered counsel. They’ll say it’s a tragic coincidence, that the quote is from a public trial transcript, that anyone could have used it.”

“He bought her building last month,” Elara said, the realization dawning with icy clarity. “Through a shell corporation. I didn’t make the connection until now. He’s her landlord.”

Mendes’s eyebrows lifted. “That’s something. We’ll look into the corporate trail. But these layers… they take time to peel back.” He looked at her, a long, assessing look. “Elena Vance, you should know. There’s a pattern developing here. A violent acquittal you were involved in. A civil suit filed against you. Now your closest friend is brutally attacked, with echoes of that same case. From an investigative standpoint, you are a nexus of chaos.”

The implication hung in the air, toxic and suffocating. “You think I had something to do with this?”

“I think,” Mendes said carefully, “that until we find evidence pointing definitively elsewhere, we have to consider all angles. Including the possibility you are a target… or a catalyst.”

He left her there, standing under the fluorescent lights, feeling the walls of the institution—the hospital, the law, The gritty, impersonal streets and dive bars where truth lingers itself—closing in. She was no longer just a lawyer or a victim. She was a person of interest.
The next forty-eight hours were a waking nightmare. Visits to Maya, who now jumped at the sound of the door opening. Frustrated calls to Mendes’s superior, which went unanswered. The malpractice suit papers sat on her kitchen table like a malevolent centerpiece, its legalese a constant hum in the background of her terror.

It was Leo, the hacker, who found the property record. His message was typically terse, a encrypted burst on a burner phone: Check parcel 42-7761-OL. Adjacent to your cabin. Purchased 5 days ago. Shell corp. ‘Wolfshead Holdings.’ Trace ends at a Bermudan trust. Julian Thorne’s fingerprints all over the architecture.

Her cabin. The one place she’d felt safe. The remote, wooded plot near Snoqualmie Pass, a legacy from her father. Her retreat. Her bunker.

Julian was next door.

The rage that erupted in her was volcanic, blinding. It burned away the fear, the calculation, the lawyerly restraint. It was a pure, primal response to a predator marking its territory. He wasn’t just coming for her career or her friend. He was colonizing her life, her history, her last refuge.

She didn’t think. She drove.

The two-hour journey was a blur of winding mountain roads and gathering storm clouds. The air grew colder, thinner. Her cabin looked the same—weathered cedar, a stone chimney, the quiet embrace of towering Douglas firs. But the feeling was gone. The peace was poisoned.

She didn’t even go inside. She stalked past her own property line, into the dense undergrowth that separated her land from the new parcel. And there it was. Not a cabin. A statement.

A modern monolith of glass and steel was being erected on the cleared hillside, directly overlooking her humble A-frame. It was half-finished, a skeletal frame that already dominated the landscape. Construction equipment sat silent—it was Sunday. And on the deck, wearing a charcoal sweater and sipping from a thermos, stood Julian Julian Thorne.

He watched her approach, a small, serene smile on his face. He looked like he was surveying his kingdom.

“Elara,” he called out, his voice carrying easily in the crisp, thin air. “I was hoping you’d come. I wanted to apologize for the view during construction. It will be much more pleasing when it’s done.”

She stopped twenty feet from him, her boots sinking into the churned mud of the construction site. The wind whipped her hair across her face. “You hurt Maya.”

His smile didn’t falter. “A terrible thing. I read about it. The city is not what it was.”

“You quoted your trial. You wanted me to know it was you.”

He took a sip from his thermos. “The law is a language, Elara. You of all people know that. Quotes can be used by anyone. Context is everything.” He gestured to the structure around him. “What do you think? The glass is specially treated. One-way. I’ll be able to enjoy the wilderness in complete privacy. A man needs a sanctuary, don’t you think? Especially when he’s under such… unfair scrutiny.”

The calm, the arrogance, the sheer enjoyment he took in her anguish—it snapped the last thread of her control.

“You psychotic bastard!” she screamed, the sound raw and torn from her throat. She surged forward, closing the distance. “I will destroy you! I will take everything you have! I don’t care how many lawyers or shell companies you hide behind! I will find you and I will make you pay for what you did to her!”

She was right in front of him now, trembling with fury, her finger jabbing at the air an inch from his chest. Spittle flew from her lips. “You think you’re untouchable? You think your money and your games protect you? I’m coming for you, Julian. Not in your courtroom. In the dark. You’ll never see me coming.”

Julian didn’t flinch. He simply looked down at her, his head tilted, that infuriating smile still playing on his lips. His eyes, however, were flat and cold as river stones. He said nothing.

It was the silence that finally broke the fever. The realization of where she was, what she was doing, crashed over her. She took a stumbling step back, the rage evaporating, leaving only a hollow, shaking terror.

She turned and fled, back through the mud, into the trees, towards her cabin. She didn’t look back.
The restraining order was served at her office two days later.

Officer Mendes was there again, his expression grim. He handed her the papers. “He filed this morning. Hearing is set for Friday, but the temporary order is effective immediately. You are to stay five hundred feet away from Julian Julian Thorne, his residence, his workplace, and his property.”

Elara scanned the document, her vision blurring. The language was stark, painting her as unhinged, threatening, violent. And then she saw the exhibit: a link to a digital file.

She opened it on her laptop with Mendes watching.

It was high-definition, crystal-clear footage from multiple angles. There was the half-built house, the mountain backdrop. There she was, storming into the frame, her face contorted with rage. The audio was pristine. Every word of her tirade was captured.

“I will destroy you!”
“I will find you and I will make you pay!”
“I’m coming for you, Julian. Not in your courtroom. In the dark.”

On screen, she looked monstrous. Unhinged. Julian, in contrast, was a portrait of still, victimized dignity. He didn’t speak, didn’t threaten, didn’t move. He just endured her onslaught.

“He provoked me,” she whispered, her throat tight. “He attacked my friend. He bought that land to provoke me.”

“The footage doesn’t show provocation,” Mendes said quietly. “It shows you trespassing and making credible, violent threats. His civil suit against you lends weight to his claim of harassment. The judge granted the temporary order in fifteen minutes.”

The legal inversion was complete. In the eyes of the law, she was now the aggressor. He was the victim seeking protection. Her credibility, her career, her very freedom were now balanced on the knife’s edge of this order. Any move she made against him could land her in jail.

After Mendes left, she sat in the deepening gloom of her office. The city lights twinkled outside, a galaxy of indifferent order. She had never felt so utterly, completely trapped. The law, the system she had dedicated her life to, had become her cage. Julian wasn’t just using the law as a shield. He was using it as a surgical instrument, dissecting her life piece by piece.

Her burner phone buzzed. Leo.

Saw the news. RO is a masterstroke. He’s boxing you in legally. Only move left is the one he can’t see.

She typed back, her fingers numb. I’m listening.

The entrapment plan. The one we sketched. It’s the only path now. He expects you to be reactive. To be emotional. So we use it. We let him think he’s won, that you’re broken. We make him overconfident. And then we offer him exactly what he wants—a chance to gloat, to confess, to truly own his victory. On our recorders.

Elara stared at the words. Going outside the law. Setting a trap. It was everything she had sworn against. It would cost her whatever was left of her soul.

She looked at the restraining order on her desk, then at a photo on her bookshelf—her and Maya, laughing on a sun-drenched ferry deck a lifetime ago.

She picked up the burner phone.

Set it up, she typed. I’m in.

The hook settled deep within her, cold and sharp. She was no longer just defending. She was hunting. And the only bait she had left was herself.
