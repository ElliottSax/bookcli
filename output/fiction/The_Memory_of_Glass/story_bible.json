The apparent suspect is Detective Thorne, who was investigating Alistair for fraud. Using her unique ability to 'read' the sonic history of the space and the shattered glass artwork at the crime scene, Evelyn uncovers a truth Thorne missed: her father was creating a secret, honest record of his confession on vinyl, embedded within the glass. Thorne is apprehended, but the case feels unresolved. The hook arrives\u2014a new vinyl recording of her father working, with evidence of a second, unknown listener in the room. Evelyn realizes the killer is still free, someone who shared that silent space and is now listening to her, turning her greatest asset\u2014her attunement to sound\u2014into a vulnerability. The mystery is not closed; it has just begun playing a new track."
