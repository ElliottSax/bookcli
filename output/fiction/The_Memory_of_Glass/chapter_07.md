As Evelyn walked through the station, she couldn't shake the image of the scene Leo had described - the gallery, the sculpture, the body. He'd planned every detail to manipulate the audience and the investigation.
She asked, her voice steady, "The gallery was all part of your plan, wasn't it? The way sound traveled, the way light hit the glass?"

Leo's voice softened. "Every detail mattered. The glass shattering, the sound of the fall echoing through the space - it was all meant to create a specific effect."

Evelyn cold anger rising in her chest, a slow-burning heat that pushed against the chill of the station. She'd known Leo for years, trusted him, and admired his talent. But this was different. He'd used his art to manipulate and destroy.
"You're a monster," she said, her voice low and steady. "You used a man's life as a prop in your twisted game."

Leo laughed, a sharp, bitter sound that echoed through the station. "And what about you, Evelyn? You use your blindness to your advantage. You make people feel sorry for you, trust you. You're no better than I am."

Evelyn words like a physical blow, a sharp pain that radiated through her chest. She'd spent her life learning to navigate a world that didn't understand her, a world that saw her disability as a weakness. She'd turned it into a strength, using it to her advantage. But Leo's words cut deep because they were true. She'd used her blindness to get what she wanted.
She took a deep breath, steadying herself. She couldn't let Leo's words get to her. She had to stay focused, keep him talking. She needed to know the truth, understand the depths of his deception.
"You're right," she said, her voice calm and measured. "I've used my blindness to my advantage. But I've never hurt anyone. I've never taken a life."

Leo was silent for a moment, the only sound the distant hum of the station and the faint rustle of late-night travelers. Then, he spoke, his voice soft and dangerous. "You don't understand what it's like to be invisible, to be seen as nothing more than a tool. I had to make them see me, hear me."

Evelyn pang of sympathy, a flicker of understanding. She knew what it was like to be seen as less, to be underestimated. But she also knew there was a line that couldn't be crossed. And Leo had crossed it.
"You could have walked away," she replied, her voice firm. "You could have started over, found a way to make your art known without hurting anyone. You didn't have to do this."

Leo was silent again, the only sound the distant echo of a train pulling into the station. Then, he spoke, his voice soft and sad. "I didn't have a choice, Evelyn. I didn't have a choice."

Evelyn cold, hard resolve settling in her chest. She had to stop him. She had to make sure he never hurt anyone again. She took a deep breath, steadying herself. She had to be smart, careful. She had to outmaneuver him.
"You're wrong, Leo," she said, her voice calm and steady. "You always have a choice. And you made the wrong one."

She heard the faint rustle of his jacket as he shifted his weight, the soft scrape of his shoe against the pavement. She knew he was getting ready to leave, to run. She had to act fast.
"Leo," she answered, her voice sharp and commanding. "Don't move."

She heard the faint click of a safety being released, the soft metallic whisper of a gun being cocked. She knew he had a weapon, was willing to use it. She had to be careful, smart. She had to outmaneuver him.
"Evelyn," he said, his voice soft and dangerous. "Don't be a fool. You don't want to do this."

She took a deep breath, steadying herself. She had to be brave, strong. She had to be the one to end this.
"Leomurmuredhe said, her voice firm and steady. "It's over. You're done."

She took a step forward, her cane tapping lightly against the pavement. The sound was swallowed by the space, leaving no trace. She had to be careful, smart. She had to outmaneuver him.
