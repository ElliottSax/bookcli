 hrough the gallery. He’d be the star. The tragic artist, undone by his own obsession. The audience would see his body, but they’d hear my story. The way I wanted it told. The way it should have been told all along.”

Evelyn felt the weight of the station pressing down, the cold stone and iron a physical presence. The echoes of Leo’s voice seemed to linger, twisting and distorting as they bounced off the walls. She could almost see the scene he was describing—the gallery, the sculpture, the body. It was a carefully constructed illusion, designed to manipulate not just the audience, but the investigation itself.

“And the gallery?” she asked, her voice steady. “The way the sound traveled, the way the light hit the glass… it was all part of the plan.”

“Of course,” Leo said, his voice softening. “Every detail mattered. The way the glass shattered, the way the sound of the fall echoed through the space. It was a symphony. A requiem for the man who thought he could outsmart me.”

Evelyn felt a cold anger rising in her chest, a slow, simmering heat that pushed against the chill of the station. She had known Leo for years, had trusted him, had even admired his talent. But this—this was something else. This was a man who had turned his art into a weapon, who had used his creativity to manipulate and destroy.

“You’re a monster,” she said, her voice low and steady. “You used a man’s life as a prop in your twisted little play.”

Leo laughed, a sharp, bitter sound that echoed through the station. “And what about you, Evelyn? You use your blindness as a prop. You use it to manipulate people, to make them feel sorry for you, to make them trust you. You’re no better than I am.”

Evelyn felt the words like a physical blow, a sharp, stinging pain that radiated through her chest. She had spent her life learning to move through a world that didn’t understand her, a world that saw her disability as a weakness. She had turned it into a strength, had used it to her advantage. But Leo’s words cut deep, because they were true. She had used her blindness, had used the way people saw her, to get what she wanted. And now, she was no better than the man standing in front of her.

She took a deep breath, steadying herself. She couldn’t let Leo’s words get to her. She had to stay focused, had to keep him talking. She needed to know the truth, needed to understand the depths of his deception.

“You’re right,” she said, her voice calm and measured. “I’ve used my blindness to my advantage. But I’ve never used it to hurt someone. I’ve never used it to take a life.”

Leo was silent for a moment, the only sound the distant hum of the station, the faint rustle of late-night travelers. Then, he spoke, his voice soft and dangerous. “You don’t understand, Evelyn. You don’t understand what it’s like to be invisible. To be seen as nothing more than a tool, a means to an end. You don’t understand what it’s like to be used, to be betrayed. I had to do what I did. I had to make them see me. I had to make them hear me.”

Evelyn felt a pang of sympathy, a flicker of understanding. She knew what it was like to be seen as less, to be underestimated. But she also knew that there was a line, a boundary that couldn’t be crossed. And Leo had crossed it. He had crossed it in the worst possible way.

“You could have walked away,” she said, her voice firm. “You could have started over, could have found a way to make your art known without hurting anyone. You didn’t have to do this.”

Leo was silent again, the only sound the distant echo of a train pulling into the station. Then, he spoke, his voice soft and sad. “I didn’t have a choice, Evelyn. I didn’t have a choice.”

Evelyn felt a cold, hard resolve settling in her chest. She had to stop him. She had to make sure he never hurt anyone again. She took a deep breath, steadying herself. She had to be smart, had to be careful. She had to outmaneuver him.

“You’re wrong, Leo,” she said, her voice calm and steady. “You always have a choice. And you made the wrong one.”

She heard the faint rustle of his jacket as he shifted his weight, the soft scrape of his shoe against the pavement. She knew he was getting ready to leave, knew he was getting ready to run. She had to act fast.

“Leo,” she said, her voice sharp and commanding. “Don’t move.”

She heard the faint click of a safety being released, the soft metallic whisper of a gun being cocked. She knew he had a weapon, knew he was willing to use it. She had to be careful, had to be smart. She had to outmaneuver him.

“Evelyn,” he said, his voice soft and dangerous. “Don’t be a fool. You don’t want to do this.”

She took a deep breath, steadying herself. She had to be brave, had to be strong. She had to be the one to end this.

“Leo,” she said, her voice firm and steady. “It’s over. You’re done.”

She heard the faint rustle of his jacket as he shifted his weight, the soft scrape of his shoe against the pavement. She knew he was getting ready to leave, knew he was getting ready to run. She had to act fast.

She took a step forward, her cane tapping lightly against the pavement. The sound was swallowed by the space, leaving no trace. She had to be careful, had to be smart. She had to outmaneuver him.

“Leo,” she said, her voice soft and steady. “It’s over. You’re done.”
