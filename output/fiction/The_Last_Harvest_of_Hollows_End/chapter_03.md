Chapter 3: Whispers in the Well

Silence in Hollow’s End was not empty, but a held breath. It pressed against the windows the moment Elara woke, a watchfulness that prickled the skin between her shoulder blades. The first week had been a symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves. Now, the birds were gone. Only the dry rattle of cornstalks in the north field remained, a sound like old bones.

The first incident was small, almost laughable. Her favorite trowel, its handle worn smooth by her great-aunt’s hands, had been left nestled in the soft earth of the kitchen garden. Returning an hour later, she found it gone. Twenty minutes of searching sparked a flicker of irrational annoyance. Three days later, the trowel appeared not in the garden, but placed neatly on the seat of the old Ford tractor that hadn’t run in decades, its blade gleaming as if freshly polished.

Then the axe vanished. Splitting kindling by the woodshed, the solid *thwock* provided a satisfying punctuation to the oppressive quiet. A hissed, guilt-laden phone call from her old boss—demanding a data set she’d left behind—drew her inside. Upon returning, the axe was embedded not in the chopping block, but high in the trunk of a gnarled oak twenty yards away, sunk deep into the heartwood as if thrown by a giant. Standing on a milking stool to wrestle it free, her arms trembled. Thick, amber sap wept from the wound, smelling faintly of cloves.

The land was not rejecting her. It was rearranging her.

Driven by a need to assert order, she took long walks, mapping the property in her mind as she once mapped data flows. The forest bordering the western edge of the fields was a dark, dense tangle of hemlock and pine where light turned green and submarine. Pushing through a thicket of ferns one afternoon, she stumbled into a small clearing.

Her breath caught.

Seven stones, each the size of a loaf of bread, sat in a perfect circle at the center. Smooth and river-worn, their grey was so uniform it seemed artificial. Geometric precision defined their placement, the moss and leaf litter around them scuffed away as if swept by a careful hand. This was no glacial deposit, but intention. Crouching, she reached out, stopping inches from the nearest stone. A deep, mineral chill radiated from it, unrelated to the shaded air. Absolute silence reigned here—no insect hum, no rustle of a squirrel. The trees around the clearing seemed to lean in, a silent audience. Backing away slowly, a feeling of trespass burned in her throat.

Marked on the original property sketch was a small circle near the northern treeline: the well. She found it by tripping over the low, crumbling ring of fieldstone that surrounded it. The wooden cover, a thick slab of oak gone soft with rot, had been dragged partly aside. It hadn’t been like that yesterday.

Kneeling on the cold stone, she peered into the darkness. A smell rose up—not of damp earth or stagnant water, but of deep, flinty cold and something else, something green and ancient, like the heart of a buried forest. The well was dry, a shaft descending into absolute black.

“Hello?” Her voice was swallowed by the throat of stone.

Nothing. Then, a scrape. A trickle of grit. Leaning closer, her own pulse grew loud in her ears.

It started as a susurration, the sound of wind through distant reeds. Coalescing, rising from the depths, not one voice but many—layered, echoing, impossible to locate. A chorus of faint, sighing whispers. Words remained indistinct, only a cadence, a rhythm syncing with the thrumming in her own veins. Every sense funneled into that dark hole, her body rigid with strain.

One word, clear and cold as a pebble dropped in still water, rose above the rest.

“Balance.”

It wasn’t spoken, but formed from the echoes and the dark. Jerking back as if scalded, Elara scrambled away from the well’s rim on hands and knees. The whispers ceased instantly, leaving a silence that landed like a physical blow. The word hung in the air, in her mind. *Balance*. The word from the ledger. *Given: One bushel of winter rye. Received: Balance of the blight on the south field.*

This was no longer a quaint mystery, but a language, and the surrounding Appalachian landscape was speaking it.

A twenty-minute drive down a winding, ill-kept road led to Mill Crossing, a clutch of faded buildings huddled against a sluggish river. The place felt forlorn and time-worn, left behind by the century. Elara’s Jeep sat alone in the gravel lot of the general store.

Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of old wood, coffee, and fertilizer. A few old men in seed caps sat by a pot-bellied stove, their conversation dying as the bell above the door jingled. Behind the counter, a woman with a tight perm and sharper eyes polished a glass jar of penny candy.

“Morning.” Elara’s voice sounded too bright in the quiet.

“Help you?” the woman asked, not unkindly.

“Just getting a few things. And maybe some local gossip.” A smile accompanied the batteries and loaf of bread placed on the counter. “I’m new out at Hollow’s End.”

The change was instantaneous and profound. The woman’s hands stilled on the jar. Murmurs by the stove ceased entirely. All faint, friendly curiosity drained from the woman’s face, replaced by a careful, blank neutrality—the expression of someone seeing a venomous snake they hoped would just slither past.

“Hollow’s End,” the woman repeated, as if confirming a diagnosis.

“Yes. I inherited it from my great-aunt, Maeve.”

At the name, one of the old men by the stove shifted, his chair leg scraping the floorboards. The woman’s eyes flicked to a point over Elara’s shoulder, a silent communication.

“Maeve’s kin,” the woman said flatly, beginning to ring up the items with brisk, efficient motions.sk, final movements. “That’ll be fourteen twenty.”

The rejection was a cold wall. Elara persisted, feeling foolish. “I was hoping maybe someone could tell me about the place. Its history.”

“Not much to tell.” The woman bagged the items, her movements precise. “Old farm. Isolated. Your change.” She placed the coins on the counter, not in Elara’s hand.

“Is there a library? An historical society?”


Elara's fingers brushed against the worn, wooden handle of her great-aunt's loom as she made her way to the old barn. It had sat silent for nigh on thirty years, a relic of a time when the town spun its own yarn. The air inside was heavy, a mix of dust, decay, and memories. She navigated the narrow aisles, her eyes adjusting to the dim light that filtered through the grimy windows. The scent of mildew clung to the air, but beneath it, she detected the faint tang of wool.

She'd always loved helping her great-aunt weave, watching the threads come together to form something whole and sturdy. Elara's fingers itched to work the loom, to feel the gentle rhythm and the satisfaction of creating something from nothing. She settled onto the cushioned stool, testing the seat of the loom. The creak was familiar, a welcome sound. She picked up a spool of yarn, the soft yarn catching in the first few picks. Her mind began to unwind, the gentle motion a meditation from the day's anxiety.

As the morning wore on, the silence of the barn began to feel like a shield. Outside, the wind stirred, rustling the leaves in the old oak trees lining the fields. Inside, Elara felt the stillness gather and settle, a sense that she was a part of The surrounding Appalachian landscape, connected to the trees and the soil. In the moments she wove, she lost herself to the task, leaving behind the whispers in the well, and her own uncertain thoughts.


Moonlight etched long shadows across the windows of Elara's cabin, tracing paths that seemed to move and twist in the wind. Outside, the night air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and new life – a contrast to the dry, skeletal beauty of the field. She'd taken to spending her evenings by the woodstove now, the heat a poor substitute for the warmth the fireplace once brought to the old, sturdy frames of the cabin.

Her hands, moving with practiced ease, kneaded the dough on the scarred wooden workbench. She'd always made bread by hand, finding solace in the gentle push of the dough as it slowly transformed into something new. The rhythmic motion seemed to quiet the chatter in her head, to calm the itch of unease that had been plaguing her.

There was a knock at the door. Her best friend Emma stood on the porch, her hair a wild tangle of dark curls in the pale moonlight. She was dressed in the worn jeans and faded denim jacket Elara had known her in since their early twenties, a sign she'd come not to gossip, but on business.

"You look like you've seen a ghost," Emma said, stepping inside as Elara handed her a wad of dough cloth. "I've been calling for days. What's going on?"

Elara passed her a bowl of flour and sat down beside her, folding her arms across her chest. Emma took the measure with a quiet precision, their hands slipping into an old routine that spoke of a deeper understanding between them. The bread-making process itself required little in the way of conversation, allowing their words to flow in a gentle stream.

"It started happening a few days ago," Elara said, as the woodstove cast a small, golden pool across their hands. "Tools going missing. And a few other things."

Emma worked the dough with an intensity Elara admired, though she couldn't explain why. It seemed to be a measure of her own unspoken fear.


The Well's Edge

Mid-October's chill had started to seep into the bones of Hollow's End farm: the farmhouse, the overgrown fields, the ancient woods, the hidden cellar farm: the farmhouse, the overgrown fields, the ancient woods, the hidden cellar. Elara stood at the well's edge, hands resting in the hollows of her waist as she gazed down into the silence. The wooden cover had creaked as she lifted it, releasing a whiff of damp earth and mildew. Water lapped quietly at the stone lip above, where the wooden ladder reached down like a skeletal arm.

A day or two since the axe affair; her mind wandered back to those eerie, polished surfaces and the way the yellow sap had seemed to swallow the light. The memory left a residue of edginess on her skin. Her great-aunt used to tell stories of people settling disputes by offering stones, not just by laying them down, but tossing them into wells. As for the whispers in her head, they felt sharper, more like a cold breeze that danced up her back.

A soft hum, and a blackbird took up its nightly perch on the wooden cover, its eyes red-rimmed. Elara watched the blackbird settle between the well's face and the darkening expanse of Hollow's End farm: the farmhouse, the overgrown fields, the ancient woods, the hidden cellar farm: the farmhouse, the overgrown fields, the ancient woods, the hidden cellar, feeling for the connection to something beyond Hollow's End farm: the farmhouse, the overgrown fields, the ancient woods, the hidden cellar farm: the farmhouse, the overgrown fields, the ancient woods, the hidden cellar's boundaries. That night, a month and a half before, she'd started noticing an old man's shadow, flit and disappear in the corners of her peripheral vision. It was only now that the nights became icy that his presence started to make sense.

She dipped a cup into the well, half-expecting the echoes of ancient stories to leap up in the water's surface. The moon climbed higher in the darkening sky, filling the rim of the well with silver light. It didn't help; she still saw nothing. After a moment's hesitation, she leaned forward, feeling her breath condense on the cold stone.


The rain had begun just as Elara stepped off the creaky wooden bridge that spanned the gully beyond the barn. Rainwater swirled in the rivulets that danced through the dusty field. Each drop on the leaf seemed to have its own distinct weight as the rhythm changed and swelled like a cappella chorus. In the driving mist, she lost her footing and slid. Cursing under her breath, she braced herself against a sapling and pushed back into standing. For a fleeting moment, her thoughts were tangled with the trees' slender limbs outstretched like her own skeletal fingers.

The well's weathered stone seemed a haven in the deluge, just a dark and dripping triangle looming through the gray veil. Raindrops formed tiny streams on the rim, running together, their rhythmic chant like those distant, low murmurs that began as laughter but grew into the whispers she could hardly ignore. 

Elara paused, letting the water trickle down her arm, running between the ridges of dirt and peat which stained her tattered sleeves while her hands trembled as if awakening to grip the cool stonework. In the rain's tumult, the world had become smaller: just her, the trees, the gully's dark, narrow passage, and the well that waited, an underground, unseen pulse like a creature guarding ancient, primal knowledge.

She stooped, running the wet hands down the cold well's rim. 'My great-aunt found nothing but silence here,' the memory whispered in her mind, but something about her posture had awakened memories and tales of ancestors long since gone and the stories which tied the people and the place together. This was their earth, given by hands unseen and bound to hearts unseen.

In a faint tremble, Elara felt The surrounding Appalachian landscape's restlessness spreading in her body – a restless pressure – for the threads which bound this patch of earth to those who lived above were frayed now, the delicate, unbroken continuity disrupted. If she wanted the whispers to stop, she needed to uncover what she owed, to re-knit the scattered threads.

The air seemed colder just then, heavy with things unseen. As the rain slowed to a quiet patter on her hair, a single leaf drifted, floating from above, landing softly on the stone rim and beginning to draw intricate lines of moisture, like writing, disappearing in the ripples as the drop, spreading, formed rivulets.

Elara tasted salt, felt cold sweat dot her upper lip. At first, it was a tiny thread of sound – two syllables – only the faint scent of burning metal and her skin prickling like a raised collar on the nape of her neck. Then words came – words of a woman, far away, yet echoing, growing louder. Their cadence shook the air and made her arms tingle. Elara leaned back, a shiver racing through her vertebrae.

"Listen to us," the woman's voice was like moonlight. "Your stones. Your words."

And again, more desperate, a voice caught in the back of a throat like the screech of the well-bucket against stone: "Find us."

It took another moment before she could swallow and force air into her lungs. Her hands were cold, shaking, but she took another sip of the water, trying to quell the fear growing inside – not panic, but a feeling she must confront head-on.

Elara's grip on her sleeve tightened and her fingers curled like claws around her wrist. She looked out at the shadowy shapes beyond the trees. No one – not her great-aunt's spirits or her past self – could understand her fear, or maybe the only answer that would set things right was hidden deep in those woods. 

Breath frozen on her tongue, she peered into the darkness.

"What kind of other things?" Emma's eyes shot up, meeting Elara's.

Elara hesitated, her eyes drifting to the window where the wind whispered secrets to the fields. "I had a key go missing this morning," she said slowly, a thread of trepidation worming its way through her tone. "And something else, something...else. Not really important."

Emma put down the dough, her hands cradling the mass of flour-covered bread like an offering. "You're hiding something, Elara. You always do when you're scared."

Their gazes fought across the room, a challenge Elara couldn't quite make out. The stillness outside, the whispering wind, and the dead earth of the fields waited beyond the wooden frame of their lives, their very stillness a warning that time wasn't something to be overlooked.

"I'm not scared for myself," she said evenly, her eyes locked with Emma's.

Emma snorted in exasperation, rising from her seat to grab a worn blue apron from the door jamb and tie it over her waist. Her hands began to fold the dough, their fingers working in silence. As she worked, she began to talk, her words flowing like a small braid of truth and laughter, though what underpinned them was the quiet acknowledgment of a dark and unsettling fact shared between them - a bond only the cold moonlight and their shared labor could witness.

The bread rose in the night's cold, slow light.

But when she paused to take a drink from the thermos on the stool, she noticed the loom stood at an odd angle. The warp threads hung limply to one side, and the weft had been left in an uneven pattern—unlike anything she'd weave. Confusion flickered, like a candle flame in the wind, as she realized she didn't recognize the pattern. A shiver crawled up her spine as she stared at the half-finished work, feeling an inexplicable unease. It was...not her. Not like her great-aunt, not like Elara, but something in between. Something that felt like a challenge, or a test.

She set the half-finished fabric aside, leaving the barn as quietly as she'd entered. When she stepped back into the sunlight, she blinked, feeling the world tilt, as if something had shifted, though she couldn't quite put her finger on what. A bird alighted on a nearby fencepost, watching her with an intelligent, unblinking gaze, and she wondered if she'd been naive to think this was just stillness.

As the wind picked up, carrying the scent of wet earth from the north field – a smell reminiscent of the amber sap that had dripped from the gnarled oak tree - Elara felt the shadows deepen. What was The surrounding Appalachian landscape asking of her, if not a dance, then a thread-by-thread, deliberate weaving of meaning?

A long pause. The woman’s lips tightened. “Down the street. Red brick. Mrs. Gable might be in.”

The library was a single, dusty room in a Victorian house. Mrs. Gable was a wisp of a woman with eyes magnified by thick glasses, who looked up from a massive genealogy tome with a fluttery smile that vanished the moment Elara introduced herself and her property.

“Hollow’s End,” Mrs. Gable whispered, her hand going to the cameo at her throat. “Oh, my.”

“I’m trying to understand it,” Elara said, leaning on the oak desk, trying to project a harmless, scholarly need. “The records are… unusual. And there are things on The surrounding Appalachian landscape. A stone circle. The well.”

Mrs. Gable flinched at ‘well’. She looked around the empty library as if for escape, then down at her book. For a long moment, the only sound was the slow tick of a regulator clock. When she spoke, her voice was barely audible.

“We don’t… speak of it. Not out there. Not by name. It’s an old place. It has old ways.” Her eyes, huge behind the lenses, met Elara’s. There was pity in them, and a deep, weary fear. “Your aunt… she understood the agreements.”

“What agreements?”

But Mrs. Gable was already rising, her bones creaking. She moved with sudden resolve to a tall, dark oak filing cabinet in the corner, the one piece of furniture that looked truly locked against the world. She worked a small key from a chain at her waist, opened the bottom drawer, and rifled through folders with trembling hands. She pulled out a slim manila folder, its edges foxed with age.

“This is not from me,” she said, pressing it into Elara’s hands. Her fingers were ice-cold. “You didn’t get it here. Do you understand?”

Elara nodded, the weight of the folder suddenly immense.

“It’s not a story,” Mrs. Gable whispered urgently, her face close enough for Elara to smell the faint scent of lavender and paper dust. “It’s a ledger of its own. Read it. Then decide if you wish to balance its books.”

Back in the Jeep, parked by the sluggish river, Elara opened the folder. It contained photocopies of yellowed newspaper clippings from the Mill Crossing Gazette, the dates spanning nearly a century.

The headlines were small, tucked away on inner pages, but they screamed:

Local Boy Goes Missing Near Black Creek, 1923. Search Yields No Clue.

Travelling Salesman Fails to Reach Mill Crossing, 1941. Automobile Found Abandoned Near Hollow’s End Turnoff.

Hunter Lost in Woodland, 1958. Companions Report ‘Strange Lights, Unnatural Silence’ Before His Disappearance.

Elderly Resident Vanishes from Garden, 1977. No Sign of Struggle.

Hiker from City Reported Missing, 1999. Extensive Search Called Off.

Each article was a skeletal thing, devoid of detail, ending with the same hollow phrases: “The investigation continues.” “Authorities are baffled.” “No further leads.” The locations were vague—“near the old Miller property,” “in Hollow's End farm: the farmhouse, the overgrown fields, the ancient woods, the hidden cellar farm: the farmhouse, the overgrown fields, the ancient woods, the hidden cellar west of the river,” “off the county road”—but Elara, with her new, hard-won knowledge of The surrounding Appalachian landscape, could map every one to the borders of Hollow’s End. The last clipping was from eight years ago. A botanist from the state university, studying rare ferns. He was last seen heading into the hemlock grove on the western border. They found his notebook, open to a page of meticulously drawn ferns. The last entry, scrawled in a hurried hand, read: “The stones are warm. They are not stones.” The article noted the notebook was found neatly placed on a stump at the edge of the tree line.

A ledger of the missing. The land’s dark harvest.

The drive home was a blur. The familiar woods now seemed a palisade, every shadow a potential aperture. The golden light of late afternoon, which had once felt pastoral, now felt like a gilding over something rotten. She pulled up to the house, the engine’s rumble an obscene noise in the waiting silence. She gathered her groceries and the terrible folder, her body moving on autopilot, numb with a dread that had seeped into her marrow.

She climbed the three steps to the porch, fumbling for her keys. Her foot scuffed something soft.

She looked down.

A fox lay stretched on the worn boards before her door. It was a beautiful creature, its coat a vibrant, brushed russet. It was placed with deliberate care, centered perfectly on the welcome mat she had brought from the city, a cheerful thing that now read as a cruel joke. Its body was utterly relaxed, not twisted in the agony of death, but as if in deep sleep.

Except for its head.

Its muzzle was pointed directly at the door, at her. And where its eyes should have been—bright, intelligent beads—there were two smooth, oval stones. They were jet black, polished to a high, liquid shine, and they were too large for the sockets, wedged in with a terrible, meticulous force. They reflected the dying light, and in their impossible, depthless surfaces, Elara saw the stark, horrified outline of her own face looking down.

A offering. A message. A receipt.

The keys slipped from her fingers, clattering on the porch. The world narrowed to the dead thing and its stone-eyed gaze. The whispers from the well echoed in her skull, not as memory, but as a present, chilling truth.

Balance.

The land had given. Now, it was waiting for her to understand what was owed.
