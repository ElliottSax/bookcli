  "title": "The Last Harvest of Hollow's End",
  "genre": "horror",
  "subgenre": "folk horror",
  "premise": "A reclusive data analyst inherits a remote, self-sufficient Appalachian homestead, believing it's her chance to escape a chaotic world. She soon discovers the land requires a specific, living tithe to maintain its bounty and protection, a bargain her ancestors made with the old things in the soil. Now, as the sole resident, she is both the keeper of the ritual and its most logical offering.",
  "protagonist": "Elara Vance, a woman with severe agoraphobia who craves isolation but is unprepared for the sentient, demanding nature of her new home.",
  "conflict": "Elara must navigate the increasingly hostile and animate folklore of the land, which demands a seasonal blood sacrifice, while wrestling with the moral choice of finding a victim or becoming one herself to break the ancient cycle.",
  "setting": "Present-day, in the perpetually fog-shrouded valley of Hollow's End, a forgotten pocket of the Appalachian Mountains cut off from reliable technology or easy escape.",
  "tone": "Claustrophobic, eerily pastoral, and steeped in mounting dread, where the landscape itself is a silent, watchful antagonist."
