 eeling.

The next morning, you wake to the same room, but it’s different. The light is different—softer, as if filtered through a thin veil. The air carries the faint, sweet scent of the lilac bush outside your window, something you’ve never noticed before. You roll over, and your hand brushes the cool, smooth surface of your nightstand. The sensation is familiar, but the feeling is new—it’s not just a piece of furniture, but a point of contact with the world. You sit up, and the sheets rustle against your skin, a sound you’ve heard a thousand times but now seems to carry more weight. You swing your legs over the edge of the bed, and the floor is cool under your bare feet. You stand, and the blood rushes to your head, a sensation that’s always been there but now feels more pronounced, more alive.

You walk to the kitchen, and the floorboards creak under your weight. The sound is familiar, but the feeling is different—it’s not just a noise, but a rhythm, a pulse. You open the fridge, and the cool air rushes out, carrying the scent of leftover food. You pour yourself a glass of water, and the sound of the liquid hitting the glass is loud, almost startling. You take a sip, and the water is cold, crisp, and refreshing. You set the glass down, and the sound of it hitting the counter is sharp, clear.

You walk to the living room, and the sunlight streams in through the window, casting long shadows on the floor. You sit down on the couch, and the fabric is soft and warm under your hands. You lean back, and the cushions mold to your body, supporting you. You close your eyes, and the silence is deep, profound. You take a deep breath, and the air is clean, fresh, and invigorating. You exhale, and the tension in your body releases, a wave of relaxation washing over you.

You open your eyes, and A meticulously controlled, sterile apartment (the 'Protocol' prison) is different. The colors are brighter, the shapes more defined. The world feels more real, more vivid. You stand up, and the floor is solid under your feet. You walk to the window, and the view is the same, but the feeling is different. The sky is blue, the trees are green, and the world is alive, vibrant, and full of possibility.

You turn away from the window, and A meticulously controlled, sterile apartment (the 'Protocol' prison) is quiet, peaceful. You walk to the kitchen, and the scent of coffee fills the air. You pour yourself a cup, and the aroma is rich, comforting. You take a sip, and the taste is strong, bold, and satisfying. You set the cup down, and the sound of it hitting the counter is soft, gentle.
