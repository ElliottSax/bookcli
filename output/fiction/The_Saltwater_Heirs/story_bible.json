      "description": "78, precise, intellectual, and fiercely private. A retired historian who has built a life of orderly solitude in Boston, walling herself off from her family's coastal legacy.",
      "arc": "From a state of controlled denial to being violently inundated by the repressed memories and traumas of her seafaring ancestors.

      "description": "24, sharp, adrift, and burdened by student debt and a vague sense of obligation. The least likely of Eleanor's potential heirs\u2014a biracial graduate student with no sentimental attachment to the Havelock name or fortune.",
      "arc": "From a state of cynical, aimless opportunism (seeing the inheritance as a financial solution) to becoming the reluctant archivist of a painful truth.

      "role": "Antagonist, Character, and Medium",
      "description": "Not a setting, but an active force. It is the carrier of memory, the inflictor of trauma, the source of wealth, and the final cleanser. It tastes of storm, of blood, of salt, and ultimately, of clarity."

The prose is lyrical and precise, capable of shifting from the stark, clinical details of the present to the visceral, immersive sensory overload of ancestral memory. The voice carries the taste of saltwater.",

  "plot_summary": "When elderly historian Eleanor Havelock is assaulted by the violent, sensory memory of a drowning ancestor while drinking a glass of water, she is diagnosed with a rare, epigenetic condition: she is literally inheriting the traumatic memories of her seafaring forebears. Knowing she is dying, she summons her potential heirs\u2014distant relatives\u2014to the decaying family mansion. She chooses Maya Singh, the most disinterested, and tasks her with a final project: not to manage the estate, but to piece together the true, horrific source of the family's wealth from fragmented logs and ledgers, to 'diagnose' the family curse. As Maya delves into the archives, she too begins to experience traumatic flashes\u2014the taste of storm, the sound of breaking ships. Her investigation reveals a history of maritime violence and exploitation tied to Captain Josiah Havelock's final voyage. The inheritance is not the money, but the memory itself. In the climax, Maya must choose to either carry the weight of this toxic legacy or perform a ritual of release. Following Eleanor's final instructions, she scatters Eleanor's ashes (the last physical heir) at sea, breaking the cycle. The haunting taste of saltwater leaves her tongue, replaced by the taste of clean water. Liberated, she turns her back on the sea and the inherited past, walking inland toward an open, undefined future of her own making.",
