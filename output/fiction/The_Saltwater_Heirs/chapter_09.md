Chapter 9: The Cover-Up, 1968

Chapter 9: The Cover-Up, 1968

The vial from the old lobster buoy was the colour of a bruise—a murky, yellowish purple. It felt warm in Eleanor’s palm, as if it had just been plucked from a living body. She sat in the boathouse, the morning light a thin, dusty gruel through the salt-caked windows. Outside, the harbour was a sheet of hammered lead under a low sky. She was so tired now. The bones of her hands seemed to be pressing outwards against the thin parchment of her skin, and a cold ache had taken up permanent residence in the hollow of her chest. It was not the cold of the sea, but of a cellar, of earth.

She did not want to drink. The thought of another memory, another layer of filth peeled back from the family edifice, made her nauseous. But the coordinates from the South Pacific vial had led her here, to this buoy, to this specific, ugly shade. It was a message in a bottle, and she was the only one left who could read it.

She uncorked it. The smell hit her first, a cloying, medicinal sweetness undercut by something acrid and chemical. Gin. And beneath that, the sulphurous tang of cordite, and the deep, vegetative rot of marsh mud. It was the smell of a crime scene disguised as a accident. She steeled herself, tipped the vial to her lips, and swallowed.

The world did not dissolve so much as curdle.
The taste became the world. It was 1968, a September evening thick with the promise of decay. The memory settled into her not as her own, but as a skin she was forced to wear. The skin of her father, Wallace Havelock.

She was Wallace. Fifty-eight years old, the weight of the family firm a familiar, leaden mantle on his shoulders. She felt the tight pinch of his good brogues on his feet, the constriction of a silk tie at his throat, the faint, ever-present tremor in his left hand—the legacy of a childhood polio that had left him watching his more robust younger brother, Thomas, with a mixture of envy and contempt. She saw through his eyes: the study of the main house, all dark wood and green leather, but the air was wrong. It vibrated with a dangerous frequency.

Thomas stood by the fireplace, his back to the room. He was taller than Wallace, lean where Wallace was soft, his hair still thick and touched with grey at the temples. He held a sheaf of papers, his knuckles white.

“You can’t bury this, Wallace,” Thomas said, his voice low but vibrating with a clean, cutting fury. It was Thomas’s voice that had always cut through the fog of Wallace’s calculations. “It’s not just ledgers. It’s not just ‘sharp practice.’ It’s blood. Our father sold rotten rope to the Navy. Men died. They drowned because a Havelock hawser snapped.”

Wallace (Eleanor-in-Wallace) felt a surge of defensive heat. “Those contracts saved this family! Saved this town, in its way. You think the cannery would be running without that capital? You think your precious sailing club would have its dock?”

Thomas turned. His face, usually so open and weathered by honest wind, was etched with a disgust that was physical, a blow. “Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare try to justify it. I found the requisition orders, the inspection reports that were bribed into silence. I found the letters from the Navy, asking questions Father paid to have buried. It’s all here. A chain of evidence, and every link is a dead boy.”

Eleanor, trapped inside her father’s memory, felt Wallace’s heart hammering—a frantic, bird-like beat against the cage of his ribs. It was not guilt she felt from him, not primarily. It was terror. The terror of exposure, of the great edifice of respectability he had spent his life maintaining crumbling into scandal and ruin. The terror of his dynamic, beloved brother wielding the sledgehammer.

“What do you want, Thomas?” Wallace’s voice was a dry rasp. “Money for your damned marine conservation charity? A seat on the board? Name your price and let’s be done with this theatre.”

The look Thomas gave him then was worse than disgust. It was pity. “You truly don’t understand, do you? There is no price. This isn’t a negotiation. I’m taking this to the Globe. I’m taking it to the families. The truth is the only thing that matters now.”

“The truth?” Wallace barked a laugh that held no humour. “The truth is a luxury for men who don’t have a legacy to protect. For men who don’t have a daughter to think of.”

At the mention of Eleanor, Thomas’s expression softened, just for a moment. Eleanor-in-Wallace felt a vicious spike of jealousy. Thomas had always had a easier rapport with her, his laughter coming quicker, his approval less conditional. She was supposed to be his daughter, his to protect.

“Ellie deserves better than a foundation built on lies and corpses,” Thomas said quietly. “She’s stronger than you think. She’d want the truth.”

“You will not destroy this family, Thomas.” Wallace’s voice dropped, becoming something guttural, intimate with threat. “I forbid it.”

Thomas simply shook his head, a sad, final gesture. He tucked the papers inside his waxed cotton coat. “I’m taking the Petrel out to the mooring tonight. I’ll be at the newspaper office in the morning. This ends, Wallace. However it ends.”

He walked out of the study. The memory lurched, a splice in the film. Wallace was moving, driven by a panic so profound it felt like madness. Eleanor was a passenger in this hurtling vehicle of his body. She felt him snatch a heavy torch from the hall stand, his fingers fumbling on the switch. He shoved his feet into rubber boots and plunged out into the night.

The fog had rolled in from the sea, a cold, woolly blanket that swallowed sound and distance. The world shrank to a halo of torchlight and the crunch of gravel underfoot. The air was saturated with the smell of salt, of low-tide mudflats, and the faint, sweet-rotten scent of marsh grass. Wallace’s breath came in ragged plumes. He took the path down to the private dock, not the main town wharf. The Petrel, Thomas’s sleek sloop, would be on its mooring in the channel, but the dinghy to reach it would be tied here.

The dock was a ghost pier in the fog, its planks slick with condensation. The water below was a black, murmuring void. And there he was. Thomas, a darker shadow in the gloom, untying the painter of the little rowboat.

“Thomas.”

Thomas straightened. He didn’t look surprised. “Go home, Wallace.”

“Give me the papers.”

“No.”

The torch in Wallace’s hand felt like a weapon. He switched it off, plunging them into a closer, more profound grey. The only light was a sickly jaundice from a distant security lamp on the boathouse. Eleanor felt Wallace’s mind racing, a rat in a maze with no exit. Every path led to ruin. Thomas alive meant ruin. The thought formed not in words, but as a pure, cold instinct: Only one of us leaves this dock.

“You’re my brother,” Wallace said, the words a plea and a condemnation.

“I was,” Thomas replied. There was a lifetime of distance in the past tense.

What happened next unfolded with a dreadful, slow-motion clarity. Wallace stepped forward, as if to embrace him, to plead one last time. Thomas, wary, took a half-step back towards the dock’s edge. Wallace’s hands came up, not in a fist, but flat against Thomas’s chest. A push. It was not a violent shove, not in intention. It was a gesture of removal, of erasure.

But Thomas was off-balance. His arms pinwheeled, the papers in his hand fluttering like startled gulls. His mouth opened, not in a scream, but in a soft, shocked “Oh.” For a single, suspended moment, he seemed to hang in the air, a figure etched against the rolling fog. Then he was gone.

The splash was shockingly loud, a brutal punctuation in the muffled world.

Wallace stood frozen at the edge. The black water churned, then grew still. A hand broke the surface, clutching not for life, but the sodden, disintegrating mass of the papers. Then it vanished. Bubbles rose, a brief, frantic cluster, then nothing.

Eleanor experienced the next moments from within the prison of her father’s senses. The deafening roar of silence in his ears. The metallic taste of adrenaline and gin (he’d drunk before coming out, she realized) at the back of his throat. The violent, whole-body trembling. Then, a switch flipped. Calm descended, an icy, procedural calm. Wallace turned on his torch. He played the beam over the empty dock, the undisturbed rowboat. He walked to the end, methodically scanning the water. Nothing. Just the gentle, hypnotic lap against the pilings.

He turned and walked back to the house, his steps measured. He took off the boots, wiped the torch clean, poured himself two fingers of Scotch in the study, and drank it down. He called the Coast Guard an hour later, his voice cracking with believable grief. My brother… he went out to check on his boat in the fog… he must have slipped…
The boathouse slammed back into focus. Eleanor was on her knees on the rough plank floor, retching violently. But nothing came up; there was only the phantom taste of gin, cordite, and marsh mud—the taste of her uncle’s murder. She gasped, clawing at her own throat, as if she were the one who had swallowed the harbour.

It was not the memory that felled her. It was the realization that followed it, a truth as absolute and killing as a glacier.

Her father. Her quiet, fastidious, garden-tending father. The man who had taught her to tie a bowline, who had patted her head with a hand that smelled of pipe tobacco and lemon balm. He had stood on that dock and watched his brother drown. He had calculated the angles of survival and chosen murder. He had come home, washed his hands, and performed the role of the grieving elder brother for the rest of his life. He had lied to her, every single day. He had let her worship the ghost of Uncle Thomas, a ghost he had made.

“Oh, God,” she whispered, the words tearing at her raw throat. “Oh, God, Daddy.”

The foundation of her life—already cracked and sagging from the revelations of her grandfather’s violence and wartime profiteering—gave way entirely. It wasn’t history that collapsed upon her. It was her own past. Every memory of her father was now suspect, tainted by this hidden, monstrous core. The hand that held hers was a killer’s hand. The voice that read her bedtime stories was a liar’s voice.

A pain, sharp and specific, bloomed behind her sternum. It was not emotional; it was a clinical, bright-white spike of pure physical agony. It stole her breath. She crumpled sideways onto the cold floor, her vision tunneling. The dusty light from the window dimmed. She heard, as if from a great distance, the sound of her own laboured breathing, the frantic, irregular flutter of her heart against her ribs—a trapped, panicked thing.

She did not lose consciousness, not quite. She lay there for a long time, marooned on the hard planks, staring at the cobwebbed rafters. The cold from the floor seeped into her bones, becoming one with the cold that now lived inside her. She thought of Thomas’s face in that final moment—not fear, but a profound, disappointed understanding. Oh.

When she finally found the strength to move, it was like lifting someone else’s body. She pushed herself up, every joint protesting. She looked at her hands, the prominent blue veins, the age spots like stains. Her father’s hands, in the end. She stumbled to the small, grimy mirror hung by a nail. The face that looked back was a stranger’s—ashen, the skin drawn tight over the skull, the eyes sunk in deep, bruised hollows. A sick woman’s face. The weight of the truth was not metaphorical; it was a physiological burden. Her body was beginning to refuse it.

She managed to get back to the house, moving like a ghost through the familiar rooms. They felt alien now, a museum of a lie. She avoided the study. She went to the kitchen and ran a glass of water, but her hand shook so violently she spilled most of it. She drank the little she could, but the water tasted of the vial, of the dock, of the marsh.

The hook settled into her, not with a jerk, but with a slow, inevitable penetration. It wasn’t just about uncovering the crimes anymore. It was about the cost of the uncovering. Her health was unspooling. And with this last memory, a new, more terrifying question emerged: If Wallace could kill his own brother to protect the secret, what would he have done to others who threatened it? The coordinates had led her to Thomas’s death. But Thomas had the papers. What if there were others who had seen them? Others who had asked questions?

The fog of 1968 seemed to seep into the present-day house. And somewhere in that fog, Eleanor now knew, there might be more than one body. The search for truth had become a race—not against her family’s legacy, but against the slow, sure failure of her own heart.
