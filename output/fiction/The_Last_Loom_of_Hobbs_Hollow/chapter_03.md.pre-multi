**Chapter 3: The First Weave**

The loom dominated the space. Maya’s studio was a generous downtown loft, all exposed brick and high, grimy windows. But the loom from Hobb’s Hollow didn’t occupy square footage so much as it consumed atmosphere.

It stood in the exact center of the room. The afternoon sun, weak and pale as watered-down tea, slanted through the glass. Instead of illuminating the dust motes, it seemed to be absorbed. The polished dark wood drank the light. The bone fittings gleamed with a dull, ivory insistence, like old teeth in a shadowed mouth.

For two days, she’d cleaned. Not the frantic cleaning of new inspiration, but a methodical, almost ritual scrubbing. *I need to know this thing,* she thought. Her fingers traced every inch of the frame.

The carvings were not repeating floral motifs. They were a continuous, non-repeating script of knots and spirals—a language written in tension and release. It felt less like decoration and more like a warning.

The shuttle, that heavy length of timber, she’d left alone after the first wipe-down. Lifting it had sent an unpleasant jolt up her arm. Its weight was wrong. It felt less like carved wood and more like petrified muscle.

Her own modern loom sat pushed against the far wall, shrouded in a dust sheet. It looked flimsy and apologetic, a skeleton next to a living entity.

Her phone buzzed on the worktable. The screen glowed with her agent’s latest text: *Just checking in. Gallery slot confirmed for six weeks. They’re expecting something groundbreaking. Pressure’s a privilege, M!*

Six weeks. The timeline was a vise.

“Groundbreaking.” The word tasted like ash.

She walked to the window, pressing her forehead against the cool glass. Below, the city performed its endless, indifferent ballet. This was her world: concrete, steel, explicable noise. The loom at her back was a splinter of another reality.

“It’s just an object,” she said aloud, her voice thin. She turned to face it. “A beautiful, antique object. That’s the story.”

She practiced the pitch. “‘Revivalist weaver resurrects forgotten craft on heirloom loom.’”

The marketing angle was solid. It had to be enough.

Except it wasn’t. The block hadn’t lifted; it had just reshaped itself into this silent, waiting thing. *What if this is just another dead end?*

She had nothing else. The loom was the only thread left, and she was terrified to pull it.

With a sigh that was more surrender than resolve, she moved to her dye station. She couldn’t use her modern yarns. They were wrong for this. Instead, she prepared dyes from madder root and walnut husks. The earthy scents filled the air, and she felt a flicker of the old focus.

But as the afternoon waned, she noticed a change. The city’s constant murmur—the bass thump of music, the wail of a siren—seemed to dampen, pulling back from the loom. A draft, cold and sourceless, coiled around her ankles.

She ignored it.

Hours later, the yarns were ready. The act of dressing the loom was intimate, a courtship. Threading the hundreds of ends through the bone heddle eyes consumed the day. The tiny ivory apertures seemed to guide the thread, sucking it through with a faint, magnetic pull. Her neck ached, but a strange calm settled over her. This was pure technique. It was safe.

Finally, it was time.

She picked up the shuttle. Its cold weight was immediate, a shock that traveled to her shoulder. It felt *eager*.

She sat on the worn bench. Her body settled into a groove worn by others.

Her first throw was tentative. The shuttle didn’t glide; it *sliced* through with a soft, whispering *thwip*. She caught it, her motion automatic. She beat the new weft into place.

*Thump.*

The sound was solid, final. A strange rhythm took hold. Throw, catch, beat. The world narrowed to the growing line of cloth.

She wasn’t designing, not consciously. She was simply making the weave exist.

And then, her thoughts began to drift. She thought of the cold air in the barn, of Eleanor’s papery hands. Without conscious intent, her hands began to deviate. The red yarn formed tiny, interconnected hooks and spirals, echoing the carvings on the loom.

A deep chill seeped up from the floorboards. The light over the loom seemed to dim. The air grew heavy, carrying a new scent: turned soil, mushrooms, green things growing in deep shade.

*Thump.* The sound was louder.

*Thump.* In the periphery of her vision, the shadows in the corners thickened, pooling like ink. They pulsed in time with the beat.

*Thump.* A whisper, not in the room, but in the very fabric of the growing cloth. It had *intent*.

Maya’s breath hitched. *Stop. This is a panic attack,* screamed the rational artist.

But her hands did not stop. They moved faster, more sure. The shuttle was a blur. The pattern emerging was not hers. It was being *dictated*.

A fierce, terrified exhilaration flooded her. This was not a block. This was a torrent.

She switched to the brown yarn. The image clarified. A tree, but not a tree. Its roots were knotted spirals. Its branches twisted into shapes that suggested roofs, gables—the silhouettes of houses.

The Tree and the Town. Hobb’s Hollow.

As the last pick was beaten home, the illusion snapped. The chill vanished. The light blazed back to normal.

The phone buzzed again, a frantic insect on the table. The gallery. The deadline.

She had her masterpiece.

But as she moved to silence it, the lamplight caught the woven figure in the trunk. The threads were *arranged* as her silhouette. And she saw a subtle, impossible shift.

The woven Maya’s head was now turned, just a degree, away from its loom.

It was looking out of the tapestry.

Looking, it seemed, directly at her.

A breath hitched in her throat, frozen. It was a trick of the light, a tremor in her vision. She blinked, hard. When her eyes opened, the figure’s position had changed again. The woven hand was no longer on the shuttle. It was raised, palm outward, pressed against the inner boundary of the trunk’s bark. A gesture of warning. Or of entrapment.

The phone fell silent. In the sudden, absolute quiet, Maya heard a new sound—a faint, dry rustle, like leaves whispering. It was not coming from the window. It was coming from the loom. From the tapestry itself.

The threads of her own woven image were still. Yet, in the background of the cloth, in the intricate forest of roots and earth, something else was moving. Shadows deepened. Shapes coalesced. Other slender, root-like forms were now subtly present, weaving through the soil, and each one, she saw with dawning horror, ended in a tiny, captured silhouette. The loom hadn’t just taken a piece of her. It had a collection. And she was now part of the display.
