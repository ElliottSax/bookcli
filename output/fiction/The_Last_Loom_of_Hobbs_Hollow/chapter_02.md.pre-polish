 was in the car, but she could work with what was here. Maya pulled a skein of the midnight wool from the basket, her fingers tracing the soft, cool fibers. She felt a strange sense of connection, a sense of kinship with the loom and the yarn. She began to weave, her fingers moving with a rhythm that was both familiar and foreign. The loom seemed to guide her, the threads moving of their own accord. She lost herself in the work, the world around her fading away.

The firelight flickered, casting long shadows on the walls. The cabin was silent, save for the soft rustle of the yarn and the occasional crackle of the fire. Maya's mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, a mix of excitement and trepidation. She was a maker, a weaver of stories and threads. And this loom was the key to unlocking her true potential.

She lost herself in the work, the world around her fading away. The firelight flickered, casting long shadows on the walls. The cabin was silent, save for the footfalls of the wind and the occasional crackle of the fire.

The first draft of the pattern took shape—a simple pattern of vines and leaves, the kind of thing she might have created as a child. But as she worked, the design began to shift, the threads twisting and turning in ways she couldn't quite explain. The vines grew thorns, the leaves darkened, and the pattern became something else entirely. A face emerged from the weave, its features sharp and angular, its eyes hollow and empty.

Maya's breath hitched in her throat. She had never seen anything like it. The face was both familiar and alien, a reflection of something deep within her. She felt a sense of unease, a sense of dread that she couldn't quite explain. But she couldn't stop. The loom seemed to have a will of its own, the threads moving of their own accord. She was no longer in control.

The firelight flickered, her shadow stretching grotesquely across the wall. The cabin smelled of smoke and old wood, the scent mingling with the faint, sweet-rotten odor that lingered in the air. Maya's fingers ached from the tension, but she couldn't stop. The loom seemed to have a will of its own, the threads moving of their own accord. She was no longer in control.

The face in the weave began to change, the features shifting and twisting. The eyes filled with a dark, swirling void, and the mouth opened in a silent scream. Maya felt a cold sweat break out on her forehead, her heart pounding in her chest. She tried to pull away, but her hands were frozen in place, her fingers locked around the shuttle.
