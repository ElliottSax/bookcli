 rren earth, the soil so compacted it rang hollow underfoot. The trees here were older, their bark blackened as if scorched, their branches twisted like the hands of the dead. The air thickened, pressing against her skin, and the scent of damp earth sharpened into something metallic, like the tang of a rusted blade. Her breath came in short, sharp gasps, not from exertion, but from the weight of the silence. It wasn’t just quiet here. It was listening.

Then she saw it.

The stone was a monolith, taller than a man, its surface pitted and stained with something darker than lichen. At its base, the earth was bare, not a blade of grass daring to grow. The shuttle lay in the dirt, its wooden shaft splintered, the thread frayed and blackened as if burned. But the loom itself—

It was a thing of nightmare and wonder. A frame of blackened oak, its spokes carved with faces that seemed to twist in agony, their mouths open in soundless screams. The warp threads were thick as ropes, their color a sickly, shifting gray, like storm clouds. The weft threads were thinner, but they pulsed, as if alive, their hues shifting between crimson and black. And woven into the fabric, half-formed and writhing, were shapes—faces, hands, the suggestion of bodies, all tangled in the threads, their features blurred as if seen through water.

Maya’s hands shook as she reached for the shuttle. The moment her fingers brushed the wood, the loom shuddered. The threads vibrated, and the faces in the carvings seemed to writhe. A whisper, like the rustling of dry leaves, filled the air, and the ground beneath her feet trembled.

“You’ve come back,” the whisper said, and it was not a voice, but a chorus, a hundred voices speaking as one, some young, some old, some male, some female. “You’ve come to finish what was begun.”

Maya’s breath hitched. “I didn’t know. I didn’t understand.”

“It doesn’t matter,” the loom replied, the threads tightening, the faces in the carvings straining as if trying to break free. “The bargain is made. The blood is spilled. The weave must be completed.”

She stepped back, her heart pounding. “No. I won’t let it.”

The loom shuddered again, and the threads began to move on their own, twisting, tangling, forming a pattern that was both beautiful and horrifying. The faces in the carvings screamed, their mouths opening wider, their eyes bulging.

“You cannot stop it,” the loom whispered. “The earth remembers. The earth demands.”

Maya’s hands clenched into fists. “I’m not my grandmother. I won’t let this happen.”

The loom’s threads pulsed, and the air around her grew heavy, as if the very atmosphere was pressing down on her. The ground beneath her feet trembled, and the trees around her groaned, their branches creaking as if in pain.

“You are part of the weave,” the loom said, the threads tightening, the faces in the carvings straining. “You cannot escape it.”

Maya’s breath came in short, sharp gasps. “I won’t let you take anyone else. I won’t let you take me.”
