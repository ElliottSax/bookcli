Chapter 12: A Plain Weave # Chapter 12: A Plain Weave The shuttle was a bone in her hand. The warp threads were sinew, the weft was nerve. Maya’s fingers moved not with the fluid grace of creation, but with the agonizing, precise reversal of a surgeon undoing a sutured heart. Each backward pass was a scream pulled back into a throat, a spilled drop of blood sucked into a wound, a life unlived. The Loomer’s shadow was no longer cast by the fire. It poured from the pattern itself, a stain of absolute blackness that dripped onto the cabin floor and pooled around the base of the loom. It did not speak. It pressed. The offer—the glorious, terrible future of power and permanence—hung in the air like the scent of ozone before a strike. All she had to do was stop. To weave one thread forward. To accept. Her friend, Leo, was a symphony of grunts and cracks outside the window. He’d barricaded the door with the heavy oak table, but the hollow was alive. Fingers of knotted vine, thick as pythons, tapped and scraped at the glass. Mud-men, shaped like crude parodies of the villagers from the old photographs, slumped against the walls, their faceless heads leaving damp streaks. Leo wielded a rusted axe he’d found by the woodpile, its blows landing with a wet thok as he shattered a reaching limb or a forming torso. He was a city boy who fixed espresso machines, not a warrior. His terror was a sharp, clean thing, a wire of adrenaline. Hers was a vast, swallowing ocean. Just one thread, the pressure whispered, not in words, but in a flood of sensation: the weight of raw silk in a Parisian gallery, the flash of a camera, the murmur of a crowd saying her name. You could have it. You were meant for it. Maya’s eyes were fixed on the center of the pattern. There, woven with impossible detail, was her own face. Not as she was now—sweat-slicked, hollow-eyed—but as the Loomer promised she could be: serene, powerful, ageless. The pattern radiated out from that face, a mandala of stolen fates. To unweave it, she had to unweave herself. She took a breath that tasted of dust and old wool, and pulled the thread. The world inside the loom dissolved. * She was not Maya anymore. She was Eleanor Hobb, in 1892, her hands bleeding onto the wool as she wove her stillborn daughter’s name into a blanket, the grief so vast it carved a hollow in reality that something slithered into. She was the bitterness of a man cheated of his land in 1923, the shuttle moving with his vengeful thoughts. She was the quiet, seething envy of a sister in 1954, the pattern twisting to curse a happier marriage. A hundred lives, a hundred sins, not grand evil but the slow, corrosive poison of human resentment—the unpaid debt, the whispered lie, the cherished grudge. Each had been a thread fed to the loom. Each had thickened the shadow in the corner. And she had to feel them all. Not witness, but consume. A vine smashed through the window. Glass rained across the floorboards like shattered ice. Leo yelled, a raw, ragged sound, and the axe chopped down. Cold, foul-smelling air rushed in. Maya’s body trembled violently. A line of blood trickled from her nose, warm and metallic. Her fingers kept moving. Back, back, back. The image of her face began to blur, the features softening, the knowing smile unraveling into a confusion of grey and brown yarn. The Loomer’s form shuddered. The pooled shadow began to ripple, as if stones were being dropped into it. A sound emerged, a low, sub-audible hum that vibrated in Maya’s teeth and made the bones of the old cabin creak. “You break the world,” the entity’s voice finally came, a dry rustle from every corner. “You unravel the only truth. There is only the pattern. Only the weave.” “No,” Maya whispered, the word scraping her throat raw. “There’s the weaver. And the choice.” She pulled another thread. The face in the pattern lost an eye, the socket fraying into nothing. She was a farmer in the Great Depression, weaving his hunger into a rug, the empty-knot pattern a prayer for fullness that twisted into a spell that blighted his neighbor’s crop. The guilt of it, sour and familiar, coated her tongue. Leo cried out. A tendril of thorny creeper had wrapped around his ankle, yanking him off his feet. He hit the floor hard, the axe skittering away. The mud-men oozed forward, their bodies reforming from the planked floor, reaching for his throat. Maya saw it from the corner of her eye—a still moment in the chaos. Her friend, scared to death, fighting for her. Not because of any grand destiny, but because he was her friend. That was a thread. A simple, strong, human thread. It was not in the loom. It was here, in this room. She anchored herself to it. With a gasp that was part sob, part roar, she yanked the shuttle back in a long, continuous motion. A whole row of the pattern disintegrated. The image of her face tore vertically, from brow to chin. The influx was a tsunami. A hundred voices shrieked in her skull. A hundred heartbreaks, a hundred rages, a hundred petty, human cruelties flooded her nervous system. Her back arched. Her vision whited out, replaced by a strobing nightmare of other people’s memories. She felt her own mind fraying at the edges, the mix of her identity beginning to unspool with the rest. But beneath the torrent, she held onto one simple pattern. The first her grandmother had ever taught her. Plain weave. Over, under. Over, under. The foundation of everything. Her own breath became the shuttle. In. Out. The Loomer screamed. It was the sound of tearing fabric, of splintering wood, of a wind through a deep canyon that had never known light. The shadow convulsed, pulling inward, becoming denser, darker. Outside, the vines went limp. The mud-men slumped into inert, wet piles of earth. Leo scrambled up, clutching his bruised throat, staring. Maya was almost gone. She was a vessel overflowing with black water. The final threads of the pattern—the very first sins, the oldest knots of malice—were before her. They were thick, gnarled, tar-black. She reached for them with fingers that felt like smoke. “Maya!” Leo’s voice, cracked and desperate, pierced the psychic storm. It was enough. She hooked her bleeding fingertips into the central knot, the seed of the pattern, the first wrong twist Eleanor Hobb had made. “This,” Maya breathed, the words the last solid things in her, “is not mine to carry.” She pulled. The knot came loose. There was no explosion. There was a cessation. The hum stopped. The pressure—that constant, psychic weight that had hung over Hobb’s Hollow for generations—simply vanished. It was like going deaf in a world of constant noise. The silence it left was profound, physical. The Loomer’s form unraveled like a skein of rotten yarn. The darkness didn’t flee; it dissipated, becoming mere absence of light. For a second, the shape of the weaver was visible—not a monster, but a sad, twisted thing made of regret and hunger. Then it was gone. The loom gave a long, final groan. The massive frame, the polished beams that had drunk centuries of sweat and prayer and malice, shuddered. A crack shot up the central post with the sound of a breaking spine. Then another, and another. The wood didn’t just break; it desiccated. It greyed, crumbled, and collapsed inward upon itself in a cloud of ancient dust and dry rot. The pattern, now just a tangle of disconnected, dead threads, fluttered down like a shroud. Maya fell from the seat. She did not hit the floor. Leo caught her. He was shaking as badly as she was. They sat in the settling dust, in the sudden, incredible quiet, listening to the sound of their own ragged breaths. The cabin was just a cabin. The hollow outside was just a woods, dark and deep, but no longer watching. The walk out, at dawn, was an echo of the walk in, but in negative. The trees were just trees. The stream was just water, cold and clear, with no whispers beneath its babble. The oppressive, watchful feeling was gone, leaving a lonely, almost melancholic emptiness. Hobb’s Hollow was no longer a throat. It was a scar. Leo supported her, his arm around her waist. She could not walk on her own. Her body felt hollowed out, used up. And she was changed. When they reached the old truck, parked crookedly on the overgrown track, Leo finally got a clear look at her in the grey morning light. He froze. “Your… your hair.” A thick streak from her temple, running back through her dark curls, was the color of fresh snow. It wasn’t the dry grey of age, but a stark, shocking white. She touched it, then looked at her reflection in the truck’s window. Her eyes were the same dark brown, but the woman looking back was older. Not in lines, but in depth. Those eyes had seen the pattern at the heart of things, and had chosen to pick it apart. They held a quietness that bordered on exhaustion, and a knowledge that had no need for words. “It’s okay,” she said, her voice a rough whisper. “Let’s go home.” The city was a shock of meaningless sound. Sirens were just sirens. Angry shouts were just anger. The frantic, grasping energy of the place, which had once felt like the only true pulse, now seemed like a child’s frantic dance against the coming night. Her business was gone. The gallery, with its sleek lines and curated light, had been a manifestation of the loom’s promise. With the loom dead, that promise had evaporated like a mirage. The lease was broken, the investors were ghosts, the stunning pieces she’d created now seemed garish and empty to her, like plastic fruit. She let it all go without a fight. For months, she was a ghost herself. She lived in Leo’s spare room, sleeping for twelve, fourteen hours at a stretch. She dreamed not of monsters, but of vast, empty looms and threads that led nowhere. She would wake with the taste of wool dust in her mouth. She avoided mirrors. The urge to create was dead. The very thought of yarn, of texture, of pattern, made her nauseous. The craft had been a cage, a beautiful, hereditary cage. She thought it might be over forever. Then, one rainy Tuesday, she was watching Leo try to sew a button back onto his coat. His big, clever hands fumbled with the needle, his frustration a gentle, human thing. Without thinking, Maya took it from him. “Like this,” she said, her voice still unused to speaking. She threaded the needle, anchored the thread, made small, sure stitches. The simple, utilitarian act—mending, not creating—felt clean. There was no vision, no statement, no hunger in it. Just a hole that needed closing. It was the first thread. She didn’t go back to rare silks or conceptual installations. She bought a small, simple, second-hand floor loom made of beechwood. It had no history. It held no whispers. She bought undyed, coarse wool from a local farm. It smelled of lanolin and grass, honest smells. She set up a workshop, not in a trendy district, but in a community center basement. The flyers were plain text: Weaving Circle. All Welcome. Materials Provided. The people who came were not collectors. They were retirees with stiff fingers, stressed students, lonely newcomers to One evening, a young nurse named Chloe, her hands still trembling from a long shift, looked up from her first, slightly crooked scarf. She nodded at the simple, beautifully woven grey-and-white scarf around Maya’s neck—the only thing Maya had kept for herself from the new work. “That’s stunning,” Chloe said softly. “It feels so… peaceful. What’s the pattern called?”

Maya’s hand rose to the wool, soft and warm against her skin. The white streak in it mirrored the one in her hair, not as a scar, but as a thread woven into the whole. A plain weave. Over, under. It held the memory of the choice in the cabin, the feel of Leo’s arm supporting her, the clean smell of honest wool. It held the profound silence after the scream, a silence that had become not emptiness, but space for new sounds: the thump of the loom, the quiet breath of a friend, her own steady heartbeat.

Maya stepped out of the studio, the heavy wooden door creaking as she pushed it shut behind her. The smell of freshly woven wool still clung to her fingers, and she absently rubbed them together to release the scent. Outside, the air was cool and damp, with a hint of frost that carried on the wind. She breathed deeply, feeling the cold air fill her lungs, and walked towards Leo.

He stood with his back to her, axe raised and ready, the moonlight casting an eerie glow on his face. Maya's heart skipped a beat as she took in the twisted creatures writhing against the windows. The wood was splintered and cracked, the axe head buried deep in a creature's skull, its limbs splayed across the floor like a macabre puppet.

Leo turned to her, his eyes wide and wild, and for a moment, Maya saw herself in their depths. She had expected to see fear or despair, but what she saw was a strange mixture of determination and aching sadness.

"Maya," he called out, his voice low and rough. "I think it's spreading."

Maya walked closer, her eyes scanning the scene before her. The creatures seemed to be moving faster now, twisting themselves around the window frames, trying to squeeze through the narrow openings.

She reached out and took the axe from Leo's hands, feeling the weight of it in her palms. It was heavier than she expected, but she stood tall, feeling a spark of defiance ignite within her.

"I've never seen anything like this," she said, her voice steady. "We need to shut it out."

Leo nodded, his eyes flicking between the creatures and the door. "I've been trying, but it's like...it's listening. It's adapting."

Maya raised the axe, and with a swift swing, she brought it down onto a creature's twisted body. The sound was sickening, a wet crunch that seemed to echo through her entire body. She gritted her teeth, feeling a wave of nausea wash over her, but she kept swinging, trying to keep the creatures back.

As she worked, she noticed something strange. The creatures seemed to be reacting to the axe, their movements slowing as if they were hesitant to come closer. Maya's eyes locked onto Leo's, and she saw a glimmer of understanding in his face.

"It's not just us they're after," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "It's the loom."

Chloe leaned against the wooden sill, hands cradling a mug of chilled tea left from her lunch. The sun cast dim gold lines through the studio window, giving the scattered threads of work scattered around her a gauzy quality, but the light failed to penetrate the dull grey cloud outside the glass. She was a thread in that fabric too, stretched taut but weaving on – quiet, ordinary, unassuming. She thought of Ermis, the silversmith who'd made Leo's city friends; the metallic flash and rough beauty of his work; her own fascination with the textures of broken things.

Her attention drifted back to Leo, hacking at the forest's living grip outside. Her hands moved to press a small fragment of silver into place on the frame before her, fingers closing as gently as his own.

"Had you ever thought of moving back East?"

The loom groaned under the weight of Maya’s hands. The threads, once vibrant, now hung limp as the life was pulled from them. The cabin smelled of damp earth and something older—something that clung to the walls like the memory of a scream.

Leo’s axe struck again, the sound muffled by the thick glass. “Maya!” His voice was raw. “We can’t hold them off forever.”

She didn’t answer. Her fingers trembled, but she didn’t stop. The Loomer’s shadow pulsed, thick as tar, seeping between the threads. It whispered promises in a language older than words.

“You don’t have to do this,” Leo said, his breath fogging the window. “We can run. We can—”

“And what?” Maya’s voice was hollow. “Let them follow? Let them take everything?”

The shadow rippled. The loom shuddered.

Leo’s grip tightened on the axe. “You’re not yourself.”

Maya laughed, a sound like breaking ice. “Maybe I never was.”

Muddy darkness swallowed the axe swings, its wet thok echoing through the deserted studio. Leo's face was a mixture of desperation and exhaustion as Chloe leaned against the dusty windowpane, her eyes drawn to the tangled mess beyond the panes. They'd held for what felt like hours, the barricade creaking, splintering, and slowly yielding to the mud-men's relentless assault.

Chloe raised a hand, hesitating before resting her palm on the worn surface of the loom beside her. It shuddered, as if responding to the turmoil outside. The shuttle, still gripped in her fingers, seemed heavy with reluctance. She had stopped weaving the night before, in the midst of a particularly dense thread of dark. It felt like the only way to protect Leo, the loom itself, and her entire being from that creeping stain of blackness.

Maya had left early for the village market that morning, leaving Leo to supervise the barricade. They'd decided to hold out for as long as possible, buying time for the authorities – or whoever possessed the necessary strength – to arrive. But now the mud-men seemed to be pulling the studio apart from its very foundations.

An axe blow landed particularly hard, shattering the glass on one side of the window. A cold wind seeped in, whipping Chloe's hair into a frenzy and numbing her fingers. Leo cursed, readjusting his stance to counter the widening gap. His breathing was the only sound she could focus on, except when the mud-men scuttled closer, as if drawn by the scent of desperation.

Chloe turned from the window, facing the dusty remnants of a long-forgotten existence within the studio. Old photographs hung on faded string, forgotten tools leaned against the wall, and scraps of yarn and half-finished skeins spilled across the wooden floor. The air was heavy with dust, stale air that seemed to hold the weight of all the abandoned fibers and broken dyes.

The scent of damp earth and rotting leaves clung to the air as Maya stepped outside, her bare feet sinking slightly into the soft ground. The cabin’s porch creaked under her weight, the wood worn smooth by years of use. Leo stood a few feet away, his breath coming in ragged gasps, the rusted axe resting against his thigh.

“You okay?” she asked, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands.

Leo wiped his brow with the back of his sleeve, leaving a smudge of dirt. “Yeah. Just… taking a breather.” He glanced at the axe, then back at her. “You?”

Maya exhaled, her shoulders slumping. “I don’t know. I think I might be.”

The forest beyond the cabin was eerily still, the usual chorus of crickets and frogs silent. The only sound was the distant, rhythmic thud of something heavy against the earth.

Leo followed her gaze. “You think they’re still out there?”

Maya nodded. “They don’t stop. They never stop.”

A gust of wind rustled the leaves, carrying with it the faintest whisper of something—words? A name? She couldn’t tell. Leo shivered, though the night was warm.

“What do we do?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Maya looked at him, really looked at him, and saw the fear in his eyes. Not just for himself, but for her. For both of them.

“We keep going,” she said, her voice firm. “One step at a time.”

Leo nodded, gripping the axe tighter. “Together?”

Maya reached out, her fingers brushing his. “Together.”

“Lay up with me,” Leo called, as he began slowly retreating from the mud-men's reach. “In the bed room. Now.”

Chloe nodded, pushing the dusty chair across the floor. It seemed a meager barrier against the horrors beyond the door – or what passed for a door now. The vines had grown long and robust since morning, clawing at the entrance like desperate fingers. She watched as Leo hastily barricaded the bedroom with the remaining solid pieces of furniture.

Once they were safe behind the makeshift barrier, Chloe reached out, gently taking hold of one of Leo's shoulders. His eyes sought hers in the dim light, pleading, and with it, an almost overwhelming sense of despair. He was scared, his control slipping, and even the solidity of his axe would not be enough.

In a quiet, low voice, one that might calm a fragile thing, Chloe spoke: “You should save your breath, Leo. Save your strength.”

Their eyes, red from smoke and dust, met in a slow, heavy gaze, as the screams and scratches of violence rose outside. They stood there, united, amidst the shambles of the studio, until the cold darkness beyond their door seemed to be closing in, and nothing remained but the steady, measured heartbeat of the loom beside them.

The sound was hypnotic, weaving them into its cycle, and the room grew quiet except for the patient, steady thrum of the loom's mechanism. It was an invitation to the peace of the fibers, where there existed neither fear nor dread, only the slow, deliberate making of something whole. As long as the threads of the loom endured, they would know it – a fragile, resilient heartbeat in the chaos beyond the barricades.

The threads in her hands darkened, turning to ash. The cabin floor trembled as the hollow outside pressed closer, its hunger a living thing.

Leo’s voice was a plea. “Maya, look at me.”

She did. For a moment, the shadow receded. His face was streaked with dirt, his knuckles split, but his eyes—his eyes were still his. Still Leo.

The loom groaned again. The threads snapped.

Maya’s hands stilled.

The shadow surged.

And then—

A single, sharp crack.

The glass shattered.

"Back East?" Leo barked a laugh, his axe swinging in a new arc before landing with a brutal weight. A vine snapped like a twig, then crumpled.

"I meant after the semester's done. If things...get better."

There was no pause; Leo kept at his work, his breaths steady and grim, yet an edge of tension crept into his stance.

Chloe pushed the silver frame's fragments together, careful hands working as if in counterpoint to Leo's violence outside.

Maya's grip on the axe tightened, her mind racing. "What do you mean?"

Leo shook his head, his eyes darting towards the studio. "I don't know, but I think it's connected to the weaving. To the power of the loom."

Maya felt a shiver run down her spine. Was it true? Was the loom really drawing these creatures, tempting them with its power? She thought back to the pattern, the threads of silver and gold, and the way the loom seemed to hum with energy.

As she stood there, axe in hand, the creatures thrashing against the windows, Maya felt a decision forming within her. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was being pulled towards something, something that would change everything.

And in that moment, she knew what she had to do.

With a swift motion, she opened the studio door, the axe falling to the ground as she stepped inside. Leo hesitated for a moment, then followed her, the sound of the axe still echoing in the air.

As they walked towards the loom, Maya felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. She knew that she was making a choice, one that would have far-reaching consequences. But for the first time in what felt like an eternity, she felt a spark of hope, a sense that maybe, just maybe, she was not alone in this.

The loom loomed before her, its threads glinting in the dim light. Maya reached out a hand, her fingers brushing against the fabric, and felt a surge of energy run through her veins. It was a warning, a gentle nudge telling her that she was getting close to the truth.

And with that, Maya knew that she had to make a choice. She had to decide whether to weave forward, to harness the power of the loom and face whatever came next, or to turn back, to flee from the unknown and try to hold onto the life she had left behind.

As she stood there, her heart pounding in her chest, Maya felt the weight of the decision settling upon her like a mantle. She knew that she couldn't stay trapped in the past, frozen in time by fear and uncertainty. It was time to weave, to take the threads of her life and shape them into something new, something that would last.

And so, with a deep breath, Maya reached out and touched the loom. The threads began to hum, the sound vibrating through her entire body, and she knew that she was taking the first step on a journey that would change her forever.

She met Chloe’s weary eyes and smiled, a true smile that softened her whole face. “It’s called ‘enough,’” she said, her fingers tracing the humble, perfect texture. Outside the studio window, the city lights glittered like scattered threads against the dark. They were not a pattern she needed to control, only a pattern she was part of, one simple, sturdy pass at a time. Here, in the quiet rhythm of making, she had found the only magic that ever truly lasted: the ordinary, enduring craft of mending.
