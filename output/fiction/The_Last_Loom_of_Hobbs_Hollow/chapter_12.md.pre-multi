Chapter 12: A Plain Weave # Chapter 12: A Plain Weave The shuttle was a bone in her hand. The warp threads were sinew, the weft was nerve. Maya’s fingers moved not with the fluid grace of creation, but with the agonizing, precise reversal of a surgeon undoing a sutured heart. Each backward pass was a scream pulled back into a throat, a spilled drop of blood sucked into a wound, a life unlived. The Loomer’s shadow was no longer cast by the fire. It poured from the tapestry itself, a stain of absolute blackness that dripped onto the cabin floor and pooled around the base of the loom. It did not speak. It pressed. The offer—the glorious, terrible future of power and permanence—hung in the air like the scent of ozone before a strike. All she had to do was stop. To weave one thread forward. To accept. Her friend, Leo, was a symphony of grunts and cracks outside the window. He’d barricaded the door with the heavy oak table, but the hollow was alive. Fingers of knotted vine, thick as pythons, tapped and scraped at the glass. Mud-men, shaped like crude parodies of the villagers from the old photographs, slumped against the walls, their faceless heads leaving damp streaks. Leo wielded a rusted axe he’d found by the woodpile, its blows landing with a wet thok as he shattered a reaching limb or a forming torso. He was a city boy who fixed espresso machines, not a warrior. His terror was a sharp, clean thing, a wire of adrenaline. Hers was a vast, swallowing ocean. Just one thread, the pressure whispered, not in words, but in a flood of sensation: the weight of raw silk in a Parisian gallery, the flash of a camera, the murmur of a crowd saying her name. You could have it. You were meant for it. Maya’s eyes were fixed on the center of the tapestry. There, woven with impossible detail, was her own face. Not as she was now—sweat-slicked, hollow-eyed—but as the Loomer promised she could be: serene, powerful, ageless. The pattern radiated out from that face, a mandala of stolen fates. To unweave it, she had to unweave herself. She took a breath that tasted of dust and old wool, and pulled the thread. The world inside the loom dissolved. ** She was not Maya anymore. She was Eleanor Hobb, in 1892, her hands bleeding onto the wool as she wove her stillborn daughter’s name into a blanket, the grief so vast it carved a hollow in reality that something slithered into. She was the bitterness of a man cheated of his land in 1923, the shuttle moving with his vengeful thoughts. She was the quiet, seething envy of a sister in 1954, the pattern twisting to curse a happier marriage. A hundred lives, a hundred sins, not grand evil but the slow, corrosive poison of human resentment—the unpaid debt, the whispered lie, the cherished grudge. Each had been a thread fed to the loom. Each had thickened the shadow in the corner. And she had to feel them all. Not witness, but consume. A vine smashed through the window. Glass rained across the floorboards like shattered ice. Leo yelled, a raw, ragged sound, and the axe chopped down. Cold, foul-smelling air rushed in. Maya’s body trembled violently. A line of blood trickled from her nose, warm and metallic. Her fingers kept moving. Back, back, back. The image of her face began to blur, the features softening, the knowing smile unraveling into a confusion of grey and brown yarn. The Loomer’s form shuddered. The pooled shadow began to ripple, as if stones were being dropped into it. A sound emerged, a low, sub-audible hum that vibrated in Maya’s teeth and made the bones of the old cabin creak. “You break the world,” the entity’s voice finally came, a dry rustle from every corner. “You unravel the only truth. There is only the pattern. Only the weave.” “No,” Maya whispered, the word scraping her throat raw. “There’s the weaver. And the choice.” She pulled another thread. The face in the tapestry lost an eye, the socket fraying into nothing. She was a farmer in the Great Depression, weaving his hunger into a rug, the empty-knot pattern a prayer for fullness that twisted into a spell that blighted his neighbor’s crop. The guilt of it, sour and familiar, coated her tongue. Leo cried out. A tendril of thorny creeper had wrapped around his ankle, yanking him off his feet. He hit the floor hard, the axe skittering away. The mud-men oozed forward, their bodies reforming from the planked floor, reaching for his throat. Maya saw it from the corner of her eye—a still moment in the chaos. Her friend, scared to death, fighting for her. Not because of any grand destiny, but because he was her friend. That was a thread. A simple, strong, human thread. It was not in the loom. It was here, in this room. She anchored herself to it. With a gasp that was part sob, part roar, she yanked the shuttle back in a long, continuous motion. A whole row of the tapestry disintegrated. The image of her face tore vertically, from brow to chin. The influx was a tsunami. A hundred voices shrieked in her skull. A hundred heartbreaks, a hundred rages, a hundred petty, human cruelties flooded her nervous system. Her back arched. Her vision whited out, replaced by a strobing nightmare of other people’s memories. She felt her own mind fraying at the edges, the mix of her identity beginning to unspool with the rest. But beneath the torrent, she held onto one simple pattern. The first her grandmother had ever taught her. Plain weave. Over, under. Over, under. The foundation of everything. Her own breath became the shuttle. In. Out. The Loomer screamed. It was the sound of tearing fabric, of splintering wood, of a wind through a deep canyon that had never known light. The shadow convulsed, pulling inward, becoming denser, darker. Outside, the vines went limp. The mud-men slumped into inert, wet piles of earth. Leo scrambled up, clutching his bruised throat, staring. Maya was almost gone. She was a vessel overflowing with black water. The final threads of the tapestry—the very first sins, the oldest knots of malice—were before her. They were thick, gnarled, tar-black. She reached for them with fingers that felt like smoke. “Maya!” Leo’s voice, cracked and desperate, pierced the psychic storm. It was enough. She hooked her bleeding fingertips into the central knot, the seed of the pattern, the first wrong twist Eleanor Hobb had made. “This,” Maya breathed, the words the last solid things in her, “is not mine to carry.” She pulled. The knot came loose. There was no explosion. There was a cessation. The hum stopped. The pressure—that constant, psychic weight that had hung over Hobb’s Hollow for generations—simply vanished. It was like going deaf in a world of constant noise. The silence it left was profound, physical. The Loomer’s form unraveled like a skein of rotten yarn. The darkness didn’t flee; it dissipated, becoming mere absence of light. For a second, the shape of the weaver was visible—not a monster, but a sad, twisted thing made of regret and hunger. Then it was gone. The loom gave a long, final groan. The massive frame, the polished beams that had drunk centuries of sweat and prayer and malice, shuddered. A crack shot up the central post with the sound of a breaking spine. Then another, and another. The wood didn’t just break; it desiccated. It greyed, crumbled, and collapsed inward upon itself in a cloud of ancient dust and dry rot. The tapestry, now just a tangle of disconnected, dead threads, fluttered down like a shroud. Maya fell from the seat. She did not hit the floor. Leo caught her. He was shaking as badly as she was. They sat in the settling dust, in the sudden, incredible quiet, listening to the sound of their own ragged breaths. The cabin was just a cabin. The hollow outside was just a woods, dark and deep, but no longer watching. The walk out, at dawn, was an echo of the walk in, but in negative. The trees were just trees. The stream was just water, cold and clear, with no whispers beneath its babble. The oppressive, watchful feeling was gone, leaving a lonely, almost melancholic emptiness. Hobb’s Hollow was no longer a throat. It was a scar. Leo supported her, his arm around her waist. She could not walk on her own. Her body felt hollowed out, used up. And she was changed. When they reached the old truck, parked crookedly on the overgrown track, Leo finally got a clear look at her in the grey morning light. He froze. “Your… your hair.” A thick streak from her temple, running back through her dark curls, was the color of fresh snow. It wasn’t the dry grey of age, but a stark, shocking white. She touched it, then looked at her reflection in the truck’s window. Her eyes were the same dark brown, but the woman looking back was older. Not in lines, but in depth. Those eyes had seen the pattern at the heart of things, and had chosen to pick it apart. They held a quietness that bordered on exhaustion, and a knowledge that had no need for words. “It’s okay,” she said, her voice a rough whisper. “Let’s go home.” The city was a shock of meaningless sound. Sirens were just sirens. Angry shouts were just anger. The frantic, grasping energy of the place, which had once felt like the only true pulse, now seemed like a child’s frantic dance against the coming night. Her business was gone. The gallery, with its sleek lines and curated light, had been a manifestation of the loom’s promise. With the loom dead, that promise had evaporated like a mirage. The lease was broken, the investors were ghosts, the stunning pieces she’d created now seemed garish and empty to her, like plastic fruit. She let it all go without a fight. For months, she was a ghost herself. She lived in Leo’s spare room, sleeping for twelve, fourteen hours at a stretch. She dreamed not of monsters, but of vast, empty looms and threads that led nowhere. She would wake with the taste of wool dust in her mouth. She avoided mirrors. The urge to create was dead. The very thought of yarn, of texture, of pattern, made her nauseous. The craft had been a cage, a beautiful, hereditary cage. She thought it might be over forever. Then, one rainy Tuesday, she was watching Leo try to sew a button back onto his coat. His big, clever hands fumbled with the needle, his frustration a gentle, human thing. Without thinking, Maya took it from him. “Like this,” she said, her voice still unused to speaking. She threaded the needle, anchored the thread, made small, sure stitches. The simple, utilitarian act—mending, not creating—felt clean. There was no vision, no statement, no hunger in it. Just a hole that needed closing. It was the first thread. She didn’t go back to rare silks or conceptual installations. She bought a small, simple, second-hand floor loom made of beechwood. It had no history. It held no whispers. She bought undyed, coarse wool from a local farm. It smelled of lanolin and grass, honest smells. She set up a workshop, not in a trendy district, but in a community center basement. The flyers were plain text: Weaving Circle. All Welcome. Materials Provided. The people who came were not collectors. They were retirees with stiff fingers, stressed students, lonely newcomers to One evening, a young nurse named Chloe, her hands still trembling from a long shift, looked up from her first, slightly crooked scarf. She nodded at the simple, beautifully woven grey-and-white scarf around Maya’s neck—the only thing Maya had kept for herself from the new work. “That’s stunning,” Chloe said softly. “It feels so… peaceful. What’s the pattern called?”

Maya’s hand rose to the wool, soft and warm against her skin. The white streak in it mirrored the one in her hair, not as a scar, but as a thread woven into the whole. A plain weave. Over, under. It held the memory of the choice in the cabin, the feel of Leo’s arm supporting her, the clean smell of honest wool. It held the profound silence after the scream, a silence that had become not emptiness, but space for new sounds: the thump* of the loom, the quiet breath of a friend, her own steady heartbeat.

She met Chloe’s weary eyes and smiled, a true smile that softened her whole face. “It’s called ‘enough,’” she said, her fingers tracing the humble, perfect texture. Outside the studio window, the city lights glittered like scattered threads against the dark. They were not a pattern she needed to control, only a tapestry she was part of, one simple, sturdy pass at a time. Here, in the quiet rhythm of making, she had found the only magic that ever truly lasted: the ordinary, enduring craft of mending.
