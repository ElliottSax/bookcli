# Chapter 10: To Break the Warp

# Chapter 10: To Break the Warp

The silence that followed the Loomer’s offer was not empty. It was thick, a warp thread stretched to snapping, vibrating with the hum of the loom and the frantic drum of Maya’s heart. The vision it had spun—her studio expanded, her tapestries in galleries, a life of creative bliss woven from the suffering of others—still shimmered in the air like heat haze. It was a perfect pattern, a flawless, terrible design. And it was a lie. Every beautiful thread was anchored in a knot of someone else’s terror.

“No.”

The word was a dropped shuttle, clattering against the silence. It wasn’t a shout. It was flat, final, a single thread cut.

The air in the cabin curdled. The sweet-rot smell of old wool sharpened into something metallic, like blood on a copper needle. The friendly, grandfatherly aspect of the Loomer sloughed away. Its smile didn’t vanish; it stretched, the corners of its mouth pulling towards its ears, revealing too many teeth that were not teeth but the polished ends of bone bobbins.

“A refusal?” Its voice was the sound of a thousand threads parting at once. “You would condemn them all? Your city? Your… friend?” It gestured a hand that seemed to warp the light, fingers elongating like shuttles, towards the window.

Maya didn’t look. She could feel Sam’s presence out there in the damp hollow, a bright, worried thread suddenly caught in the larger, darker weave. Looking would be a mistake. It would be a thread to pull her off course.

“You don’t get to use them,” Maya said, her voice gaining strength. She took a step towards the loom, not away from it. The journal in her bag felt like a live coal against her hip. “You showed me your truth. Let me show you mine.”

She thought of her grandmother’s frantic, spidery script. *‘A pattern cannot be cut. It must be undone from the heart. The weaver must become the unweaver, though the pattern fights like a beast in the snare.’* The elders’ fragmented stories echoed it: tales of mistakes painstakingly picked out, of curses woven into blankets that had to be patiently dismantled stitch by stitch, the curse bleeding back into the hands of the one who dared. It was always about reversal. About taking it back.

The Loomer’s form flickered. For a second, it was just a shape of gathered shadow and dust motes in the lamplight. “To unweave is to consume. The memory, the pain, the fate… it has nowhere to go but into you. You will not be its keeper. You will be its grave.”

“I know,” Maya said. She was at the bench now. The final tapestry on the loom—the one depicting this very cabin, the woods, a blurred figure at the door that was undoubtedly Sam—seemed to pulse. The colors were too vibrant, the threads seeming to move like capillaries under skin.

She sat. The worn wood of the bench was ice-cold. She placed her hands on the woven image, not on the frame. The texture was wrong. It wasn’t rough wool; it was slick and slightly yielding, like cooled fat. She recoiled, then forced her fingers back down.

“You will break,” the Loomer whispered, now beside her ear, though she hadn’t heard it move. Its breath smelled of loam and forgotten cellars. “Your mind will fray. You will be a tangle of other people’s endings.”

Maya closed her eyes. She didn’t think of Sam, or the city, or even her grandmother. She thought of the craft. The simple, profound logic of it. A thing made by hand could be unmade by hand. It was the ultimate responsibility of the maker. She opened her eyes, found the loose end of the weft thread she had seen the loom spin on its own—a thread the color of a bruise. It was tucked into the center of the pattern, right where the cabin door was woven.

This was the heart. The point of insertion. The beginning of the end.

Her grandmother’s voice, from a memory so deep it felt inherited, sounded in her mind. *‘Find the loose end, Maya. Always find where it starts.’*

Her fingernails, bitten short and ragged, found the tiny, frayed tip. She pinched it.

The effect was instantaneous.

A jolt, like a static shock fused with a migraine, shot up her arm and lodged behind her eyes. A flash of not-memory: the sensation of cold mud seeping through cheap shoes, the gasp of foggy air, the overwhelming, child-like certainty that she was being watched from the dark between the trees. Sam’s memory. Sam’s first step into Hobb’s Hollow, moments ago. The loom had already begun weaving her in.

Maya exhaled, a shuddering breath that plumed in the suddenly frigid air. She began to pull.

The thread resisted. It wasn’t a matter of friction; it was as if the thread was rooted into the fabric of reality itself. She leaned back, putting the weight of her body into it. A low groan filled the cabin, coming not from the Loomer but from the floorboards, the walls, the very earth beneath.

The bruise-colored thread slid out, millimeter by agonizing millimeter. With each fraction of an inch, a sound escaped the tapestry: a whispered *“Hello?”* that was Sam’s voice, taut with concern. Then, a wave of sensation—damp wool socks, a churning stomach of anxiety, the prickling nape of fear. Maya absorbed it all. It layered over her own fear, a dissonant chord inside her skull.

She wound the pulled thread around her left hand. It felt warm and slightly damp.

The Loomer watched, its form shifting and consolidating by the fireplace. It was no longer trying to persuade. It was observing, with the cold curiosity of a spider whose web is being systematically destroyed. “Good,” it hissed. “You understand the price. Continue.”

Maya found the next thread, a sickly yellow that formed the glow in the cabin window. Another loose end. She pulled.

This memory was older, granular. It was not her own, nor Sam’s. It was a man’s memory. The taste of cheap whiskey, the ache of loneliness so profound it felt like a physical hollow in the chest, the sight of these same cabin windows from the outside, decades ago, glowing with a promise of warmth that was a lie. A traveler. Chosen. Sacrificed. The thread released a sob that echoed in the quiet room, and a phantom smell of rye and unwashed clothes filled Maya’s nostrils. She wound the yellow thread alongside the first. Her left hand was beginning to feel numb, bound by the growing, pulsating coil.

She worked. The process was a brutal, inverted rhythm. No smooth throw-and-catch of the shuttle. This was a halting, surgical extraction. Each thread was a nerve being drawn out. A green thread from the woven pines brought the crushing vertigo of a fall, the snap of a branch, a final, silent impact on forest floor—another lost soul, another harvest for the hollow. A red thread, so dark it was almost black, from the hearth in the tapestry, released not heat, but a searing, jealous rage that belonged to a village elder long dead, furious at the world beyond the hills.

Her body became a catalog of agonies. A cramp seized her weaving hand, the muscles knotting as if the threads were tangling inside her. A headache, sharp and localized behind her right eye, throbbed in time with her pulse. She tasted copper, then soot, then sweetgrass, then decay—each a sensory stamp from a life consumed by the loom.

Through the growing cacophony in her mind, she heard a real sound. A knock at the door. Tentative. “Maya? You in there? Your car’s out front… the door’s open a crack. I’m coming in.”

Sam.

“No!” Maya croaked, but her voice was a dry rasp, lost in the groan of the house and the whisper of unraveling threads. The door pushed inward.

Sam stood silhouetted against the twilight, her city puffer jacket a bright, absurd blue against the gloom. Her face, usually animated with easy humor, was pale with worry. That worry shattered into pure, uncomprehending terror as she took in the scene: Maya, gaunt and wild-eyed at a monstrous loom, her hand wrapped in a bizarre, multicolored cord that seemed to move on its own; the shifting, impossible shape of the Loomer by the fire; the oppressive, wrong atmosphere of the room that pressed on the eardrums.

“What the hell—” Sam took a step forward, instinct overriding fear.

“Stay there!” Maya commanded, finding a shard of her old voice. “Don’t come any closer. Don’t touch anything.”

But it was too late. Sam’s entry was a new variable, a fresh, vibrant thread thrown into the pattern. The tapestry on the loom seemed to *shiver*. New threads, the exact blue of Sam’s jacket, began to *grow* from the woven image of the doorway, spiraling out, seeking to incorporate her in real-time.

The Loomer laughed, a sound like tearing canvas. “The thread offers itself!”

Maya acted on pure, desperate instinct. She couldn’t let the loom grab Sam. With a cry that was part fury, part agony, she lunged not for the new blue threads, but for the central cluster where the figure at the door was woven. She didn’t seek a loose end. She hooked her fingers into the weave and *tore*.

A section of the tapestry, about the size of her palm, ripped free.

The world screamed.

Not a metaphorical scream. A physical, shattering wave of sound that erupted from the loom, from the walls, from the ground. Every memory and pain Maya had absorbed amplified and reverberated. She saw flashes: a hundred falling bodies, a hundred last breaths, the slow, centuries-long hunger of the hills. It poured into her, a tsunami of stolen endings.

The cabin convulsed. The floorboards buckled, rising and falling like a ship on a stormy sea. Dust and splinters rained from the ceiling. The lamp shattered, plunging the room into a murky half-light illuminated only by the fading embers in the hearth and a sickly, phosphorescent glow that now emanated from the partially unraveled tapestry.

Sam was thrown against the doorframe, crying out.

And the Loomer… changed. The pretense of a shape collapsed. It streamed towards the loom, not as a man, but as a vortex of darkness and frantic, semi-solid threads. It was the embodied pattern, the will of the hollow, desperate to protect its heart. It flowed over the frame, into the mechanism, merging with the wood and the remaining weave. The beamed ceiling above the loom cracked open like a seed pod, and roots, black and glistening as if dipped in oil, thrust down, intertwining with the loom’s frame. The walls sprouted fibrous, woody growths that pulsed rhythmically. The cabin was no longer a cabin. It was becoming an extension of the thing, a chrysalis for the furious, wounded curse.

Maya, her nose bleeding, her vision swimming with phantom images, clung to the bench. The torn patch of tapestry in her hand squirmed, the threads trying to burrow into her palm. She could feel the structure of the curse now, its intricate, hateful logic. It was wounded. It was bleeding its stored suffering into her, but it was vulnerable.

She had to finish. She had to unweave the heart before the hollow’s violent reaction fully manifested and consumed Sam, consumed everything.

Gritting her teeth against the torrent of alien memories threatening to overwrite her own, she fumbled for the torn edges on the loom. She had to reconnect. She had to pull from the center. Her fingers, slick with her own blood and a strange, oily residue from the threads, found a broken warp. She didn’t try to repair it. She hooked it, and began to pull again.

This time, she wasn’t pulling a single thread. She was pulling the core. The groan of the earth became a roar. The roots tightening around the loom throbbed with a vile, internal light. From the tapestry, the woven image of the Loomer itself began to unravel, and as it did, the swirling, thread-like entity merged with the loom shrieked—a sound of pure, world-ending rage.

The last thing Maya saw before the pain and the memories swallowed her whole was Sam’s terrified face, and the furious, collapsing form of the Loomer dissolving into the very walls of the cabin, its essence pouring into the roots, the beams, the dust, becoming the room itself.
