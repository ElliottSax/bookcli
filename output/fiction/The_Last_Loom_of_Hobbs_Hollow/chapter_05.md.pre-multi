# Chapter 5: Blood in the Warp

The journal smelled of cedar and damp earth. Maya pressed her back against the cold brick wall, as if its solidity could ground her. Between her and the kitchenette, the loom dominated the space. No longer a curious artifact—it had transformed into a patient, angular beast.

Its polished bone frame gleamed under the pendant light like old teeth bared in a silent snarl.

Outside, a siren wailed, too close. The clock on the wall marked each second with a loud, metallic *click*. To Maya, each click was a grain of sand she couldn’t afford to lose.

Her grandmother’s handwriting was a precise, sloping script. Maya’s own hands felt clumsy as she turned the brittle page. The paper whispered, like leaves skittering over a grave.

*October 12th, 1978*

*The hunger is quiet today. It sleeps in the warp. I have woven the pattern of the Miller boy’s drowning at the old quarry, and for now, the hollow is sated.*

*These respites are the gifts it gives. They are also the hooks, baited with normalcy. Do not be fooled, my heir. The quiet is only ever a pause between breaths.*

Maya’s breath hitched. *Miller boy’s drowning.* She traced the words with a trembling finger.

This wasn’t the grandmother she remembered. This was a stranger. A chronicler of drownings.

A draft snaked across the floorboards from the loom. The pendant light swayed. Shadows stretched on the wall like a ribcage breathing.

She forced herself to read on.

*The loom is not a tool for creation. It is a mouth. A bargaining table.*

*The entity in the hollow—some called it The Loomer—does not think as we do. It is an appetite. It feeds on consequence, on the tangible echo of suffering given form.*

*We give it a tragedy, perfectly rendered in thread and blood and stolen pigment, and it grants the village another season. We are curators of a sacrificial gallery.*

“No,” Maya whispered. The word was swallowed by the silence.

She shoved the journal away. It thumped softly on the floor. *A mouth.* The space between the warp threads looked like a dark maw.

A memory surfaced, sharp and unbidden: Gran teaching her to knit. *“Every stitch is a choice. You must pay attention to the tension. Too tight, and it strangles. Too loose, and it unravels.”*

At the time, it was a lesson in craft. Now, it sounded like a grim philosophy.

She pulled the journal back. The cedar smell was cloying. She turned several pages.

*April 3rd, 1979: Wove the Harper barn fire. Needed soot from the central beam. The dreams were loud. I saw the flames in my sleep for a month.*

*November 11th, 1981: The Carter girl’s stillbirth. A difficult pattern. The silence after was profound.*

Maya’s stomach churned. This was a ledger of pain. Her grandmother’s hands had mixed ash and tears to paint pictures of despair.

She flipped toward the end. The handwriting grew hurried.

*September 15th, Last Year: The hunger is changing. The patterns it demands are… sharper. More personal.*

*October 30th, Last Year: It showed me a pattern. A tangle of crimson and steel-grey, with a core of vibrant, living green. It feels like an ending. The hollow wants the source.*

The final entry was dated just a week before Gran’s letter.

*The green thread is here. It is Maya. The Pattern-Man has tasted her potential. It wants a masterpiece. It wants her story.*

*I cannot… I will not weave it. But the hunger is at the door. The pact must be fulfilled, or it will take everything.*

Maya’s blood turned to ice.

The vibrant, living green. *Her* thread. She was the subject. Her life was to be the next offering.

Gran had chosen Maya over the town. And the entity, cheated, was coming to collect.

A violent shiver wracked her. She stumbled to the window and yanked it open, leaning into the damp night. The air was foul with rain and exhaust, but it was real. It didn’t smell of cedar and dread.

When her heart slowed, she turned back.

Her eyes went to the small box of threads. The one on top was a brilliant, mossy green. *Her* color.

A new terror dawned. If the entity wanted a pattern woven, and Gran was gone… who would weave it?

The knowledge in the journal was a dreadful inheritance. The loom, the threads, the hunger—they were now hers.

“I can’t,” she said aloud, her voice edged with panic. “I won’t do it.”

But the journal’s words echoed: *“The pact must be fulfilled, or it will take everything.”*

Could she live with weaving her own destruction to save them?

The rational part of her mind screamed that this was insanity. Folklore. Psychosis.

Yet, the evidence was tactile: the whispering threads, the sentient shadow, the prophetic horrors in the journal. Reality had frayed.

Driven by desperation, she strode to the box. She would get rid of them. Burn them.

She snatched up the skein of green.

A jolt went through her—a *recognition*. A cascade of sensory impressions flooded her: the smell of pine needles on Beckford’s trails, the cool creek stones under her childhood feet, the taste of wild raspberries.

It was the essence of her deepest connection to that place. It was *her*.

And it thrummed like a plucked string, resonating with the distant appetite of the hollow. It was a beacon.

With a cry, she hurled the skein across the room. It struck the brick wall and fell, innocuous and devastating.

She stood panting. She couldn’t destroy it. It was part of the pact.

Her phone buzzed on the coffee table. She stared at it.

**Unknown:** Maya. It’s Ben. Got your number from Mrs. Dawes. We need to talk. It’s about the house. About the sounds.

Her thumbs trembled.

**Maya:** I know. Can you meet? Not at the house. The diner on Main, in an hour?

**Ben:** Already there. Couldn’t sleep.

The connection died, leaving only the rain’s whisper against the windowpane. For a long moment, Maya simply stared at the dark screen, the ghost of his voice hanging in the air. Then, moving on an instinct deeper than thought, she grabbed her keys and a coat, stepping out into the damp night. The drive was a blur of streaking taillights and her own frantic reflection in the windshield, each mile pulling her closer to the only person who had seen what she had seen. The familiar streets, usually comforting, now felt like a tunnel leading to an unavoidable reckoning. By the time the neon glow of the diner pierced the gloom, her heart was a frantic drum against her ribs, the earlier digital exchange solidifying into a terrifying, physical reality.

The Rainbird Diner was a relic of chrome and neon, its sign sizzling against the wet pavement. Maya pushed through the heavy glass door, the bell jangling a sharp, discordant note above the low hum of conversation and clattering dishes. The warm, greasy air wrapped around her, thick with the smell of coffee and fried food. Her eyes scanned the booths, past a tired-looking waitress and a couple of truckers, before landing on the corner. Ben sat hunched in the last booth, a half-empty mug of black coffee cradled between his hands as if for warmth. He looked exhausted, shadows pooling under his eyes, his face pale under the harsh fluorescent lights. He hadn’t noticed her yet. She took a steadying breath, the door swinging shut behind her, sealing her in. Then his gaze lifted, meeting hers across the checkered floor.

“Maya,” he said. his voice gravelly. “Thanks for coming.”

She slid into the booth. “You said you couldn’t sleep.”

“Neither could you, looks like,” he observed.

After she ordered coffee, Ben leaned forward. “I went back today. In the daylight. With three of my guys and every high-wattage work light I own.”

Maya’s heart thudded. “And?”

“And nothing. The basement is just a basement. No hole. No cold spot.”

The world tilted. “But you saw it.”

“I know what I saw,” he said, jaw tight. “That whispering. It was *words*, Maya. My guys thought I’d lost it.” He ran a hand through his hair. “But we found my tape measure. Covered in rust. Deep, pitted rust. And it was cold. So cold it burned.”

He held her gaze. “Something is in that house. Something that doesn’t play by the rules. This afternoon, I heard a sound from inside. A rhythmic *thump… thump… thump*. Like a heavy pendulum. It was coming from upstairs. From your grandmother’s bedroom.”

Maya wrapped her hands around her hot mug. “The loom.”

Ben’s eyes narrowed. “The what?”

The words spilled out. She told him everything—the loom, the journal, the pact, the green thread. She spoke in a low, rapid monotone.

When she finished, they sat in a bubble of shared, awful knowledge.

Ben stared into his coffee. “A tragedy. It wants you to weave a tragedy from your own life.”

“To feed it.”

“And your grandmother refused.”

“Yes.”

“So it’s pushing.” He looked up. “What happens if no one weaves the pattern?”

“It takes everything. The ‘Great Silence.’ Whole families, gone.”

Ben, a man who dealt in concrete and measurable forces, shook his head slowly. “This is impossible.”

“The rust on your tape measure is impossible,” Maya countered softly. “But it happened.”

He acknowledged this with a grim nod. “So what do we do? You can’t be considering giving it what it wants.”

“I don’t know what I’m considering! I don’t know how to weave a tapestry! All I know is that sometThe drive back was tense and silent. Maya’s mind was a whirlwind of the loom’s rhythmic clatter, a sound that now seemed to echo from the very core of the house itself, pulling her back with a dreadful gravity. Ben’s truck ate up the miles, the headlights carving a fragile path through the deepening night, each rotation of the tires carrying them closer to the source of the hum. She stared at her own reflection in the dark window, seeing not herself but the empty chair before the heddles, imagining the shuttle moving of its own volition. The twenty-dollar bill on the café table, the abandoned coffee cups—all of that belonged to another world, one that was already receding behind them as the truck turned onto the familiar, tree-lined road that led home.

Ben didn’t hesitate. He threw a twenty on the table. “Let’s go. Now.” The cozy warmth of the diner vanished as they burst into the chill night air, the sense of emergency making the short sprint to his truck feel endless. Gravel spat under the tires as he reversed, and then they were speeding towards the county road, leaving the safe, lit island of the town behind. In the passenger seat, Maya clenched her hands in her lap, her knuckles white. She didn’t speak; the only sound was the rush of wind and the engine’s growl, a stark contrast to the silent, rhythmic threat waiting for them. The familiar landmarks blurred past, each one a marker drawing them inexorably back to the property line, the old oak, and the darkened house where something had been left, provocatively, alone.et, tearing rip, like Velcro pulled slowly apart. It was followed by a soft, moist *plop* onto the floor.

Ben fumbled for his phone, lighting the screen. “We’re calling someone. Now.”

But Maya wasn’t listening. A creeping warmth was spreading through the pocket of her jacket. Dread, cold and solid, filled her throat. Slowly, she slid her hand inside. Her fingers closed not around her own phone, but around the familiar, carved wooden disc of her grandmother’s pendant. The one she had left, she was certain, on her nightstand fifty miles away. It was hot to the touch, and pulsing with a slow, steady rhythm that perfectly matched the *shush-thump* from behind the door.

The loom wasn’t just weaving. It was calling. And it had been answered.
