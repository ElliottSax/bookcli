The key turned with a scream of rusted tumblers, tearing the quiet of Hobb’s Hollow wide open. Maya flinched as starlings exploded from the pines behind her. *An alarm just for me,* she thought.

She pushed the door. It groaned open, exhaling a breath colder than the autumn afternoon—air that carried dust, the ghost of dried herbs, and beneath it, a faint, sweet-rotten odor. Like forgotten apples softening in a cellar. It was the smell of time, not empty, but *occupied*.

Her boots scuffed on pine floors furred with grey dust. “Modest holding,” the lawyer’s letter had said. A single room, dominated by a stone fireplace so large she could step into it. A narrow bed. Rough shelves held mason jars with unidentifiable shadows inside. The light from grimy windows was watery and weak.

But it was the silence that pressed in. A thick, *listening* silence. It absorbed the sound of her entry and offered nothing back.

“Okay, Gran,” Maya whispered. Her words formed a small cloud in the chilled air, swallowed instantly. “What did you leave me?”

*“Don’t bring anything back from that place,”* her mother’s voice echoed, tight with fear. *“It’s a bad place. She made bad things there.”*

Maya shook her head. Cursed heirlooms were Gothic fiction. Her problems were real: creative block, a failing online store, the dread of irrelevance.

She moved further in. Above the doorframe, a twist of dried rowan berries and grey fur was nailed to the lintel. A woven birch star hung from the mantel. Folk wards. *Protection marks.*

Against what? Or from what, inside?

A large worktable sat under the window. And there, draped in yellowed muslin, was an angular shape—the only thing not exposed to dust. A veiled relic.

Her pulse thumped once, hard.

She approached, pulled the brittle muslin away. The loom was magnificent, a solemn architecture of dark, carved wood. The fittings were of something like antler, worn smooth from use. This loom had *worked*.

A strange compulsion took hold. Her creative block, a wall for months, seemed to crack. Here was raw making.

She reached out, trailed her fingertips along the top beam. The wood was ice-cold, but a faint vibration hummed up into her bones, like a plucked string. She snatched her hand back. *An illusion. Nerves.*

On the bench, a lidded basket held skeins of yarn in hues of the landscape: winter-river grey, twilight purple, oak-leaf orange. Among them: black horsehair, green copper wire, strips of dark leather.

Beneath, a stained notebook. She opened it. Recipes—but not for food.

*“For Memory: warp of midnight wool, weft of foxglove hair, beaten with the east wind.”*

*“For Binding: black wool, strand of the subject’s own, knotted under a waning moon.”*

Poems. They had to be metaphors.

A final, boxed entry caught her eye. *“The Weave of What Is: The Loom chooses. The Threads speak. The Weaver binds. Ask for what you lack. But name your price to the wood, for the balance must be kept.”*

A shiver traced her spine. This was her inheritance. A legacy that walked the line between creation and incantation.

She closed the book. *Folklore. Eccentric poetry.* The loom was just a beautiful tool. And she was a maker who had forgotten how to make.

For the next hour, she worked in a flurry of practicality. She hauled in her supplies, beat the dust from the quilt, wiped surfaces, cleared the worst jars onto the porch. She started a fire. The crackling flames pushed back the damp, and the cabin began to feel like a strange studio.

As the fire grew, light played over the loom, making the carvings shift. The compulsion returned, mixed with artistic hunger. Her own materials felt dead in comparison.

“Just a test,” she said aloud. “Just to see how it works.”

She selected the river-grey and birch-white wool. Dressing the loom was hypnotic. Threading the warp, the rhythmic *clack-clack*, the pass of the shuttle. The mechanisms moved with oiled precision. A simple pattern grew: grey, white, grey, white.

She wove as the world darkened to full night. The repetitive motion emptied her mind—bills, her silent shop, her mother’s disappointed voice. Only the thread, the shed, the *thump* of the beater. A deep, focused calm settled over her. She was not just making; she was *joining*.

Hours later, she cut the woven swatch free. It sighed as it released. She held it—the first thing she’d finished in nearly a year. A placemat-sized fabric, simple and sturdy.

Exhausted and satisfied, she banked the fire and fell into the narrow bed, the loom’s rhythm echoing in her dreams.

She woke in a pitch-black, silent hour. The fire was embers.

And she was not alone.

A gaunt figure stood at the foot of her bed, silhouetted against the faint glow. It seemed made of dense shadow, with a subtle luminosity like rotten wood. Terror locked Maya’s limbs. *A dream. Sleep paralysis.*

But the cold was real—a marrow-deep chill. And the sweet-rotten smell now overwhelmed the air.

The figure slowly raised a hand. A pale finger pointed at the woven swatch on the table.

Then, a voice—a vibration felt in the teeth, in the bones. Dry as dead leaves, thin ice.

***“Mine.”***

The word hung in the black air. Then, the cold lifted. The silhouette fragmented and was gone.

Maya gasped, fumbling for her phone. The flashlight beam jerked around the room. Nothing. The door was closed. The loom stood silent. The swatch lay where she’d left it.

She sat bolt upright until dawn, every nerve screaming. *Hallucination. Stress.*

But as grey light seeped in, her eyes were drawn to the table. To the fabric.

In the center of the grey-and-white stripes, a new thread now ran—a single, stark line the color of a fresh bruise. It hadn’t been there when she’d finished. It hadn’t been there when she went to bed.

It was still warm to the touch.

A soft, dry *pop* from the fireplace made her flinch. The fire had settled. But as she stared at the ashes, a new chill seized her. There, in the grey powder, a shape remained. The threads had burned, but the symbol had not. The eye, now etched in faint, persistent soot on the hearthstone, stared up at her. Unharmed.

From the dark mouth of the loom behind her came a sound—a faint, dry rustle, like threads shifting against each other. She turned, slowly. In the warp, strung and ready, a new thread had appeared. It was not grey or white. It was the deep, visceral red of a fresh wound, stark against the muted wool. The loom was threaded again. It was waiting.

The silence of Hobb’s Hollow was no longer just listening. It had spoken. And now, it expected a reply.
