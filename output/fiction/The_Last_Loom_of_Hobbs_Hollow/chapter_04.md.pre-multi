The flowers were gone.

Maya stood in the center of her studio at dawn, the raw concrete floor cold and gritty beneath her bare feet. She stared at the empty cracks between the floor slabs. No velvet-black centers, no cheerful yellow rays. Just dust, and a stray thread from last night’s frantic work.

The silence was a physical presence, thick and watchful.

*Did I hallucinate it all?* The stress, the sleepless nights—it could conjure phantoms. Or worse, a quiet voice whispered from a place of deep, ancestral fear, *what if your hands did more than just weave thread?*

The thought was a cold trickle down her spine.

Her eyes drifted to the loom. It dominated the far wall, a silent monarch of dark wood and yellowed bone. The morning light skittered across its surfaces, catching on the deep grooves worn by generations of hands. A thin, uniform film of dust already coated the bench where she’d sat last night.

As if the room itself was trying to reclaim its stillness.

The woven flowers still sat on the cloth beam, a bright, accusatory burst of color. The correlation was undeniable. A wave of nausea, part fear, part awe, wThe loom said nothing. It just waited. And in that silence, the need for a solid answer, for any anchor in a world suddenly grown porous and strange, became the only thing she could hold onto. The questions wouldn't let her sleep; they coiled in the dark, waiting for daylight and the illusion of control it brought.

The compulsion to research was a nervous itch under her skin, a frantic antidote to the silent judgment of the loom. She needed facts, history—something to ground the floating terror in her gut. By the gray light of morning, her kitchen table was already buried under a landslide of open books and hastily printed articles, a fragile barricade against the unknown. The gallery’s curator was calling at nine. How could she say, *I’ve woven flowers that manifest in reality?*

She made a strong pot of coffee. The bitter, familiar smell was a comfort.

At her desk, she stared at the search bar. Typing the name felt like opening a door she might not be able to close. Finally, she took a scalding sip and typed “Hobb’s Hollow.”

The results were a digital desert. No Wikipedia entry. No tourism site. A blurry census record from 1880 listed it as a “settlement” of 47. By 1900, it had vanished.

A deeper dread coiled in her stomach.

She searched “Eleanor West.” A single link appeared: an archived article from 1973. **Local Woman’s Bequest Puzzles Historians.**

She clicked it.

*“The recent passing of Eleanor West, 89, the last resident of the long-abandoned settlement known as Hobb’s Hollow, bequeathed a large collection of ‘folk art and domestic textiles’...”*

*“The imagery is… unusual. Not your typical pastoral scenes. A lot of botanical studies...”*

*“One loom in particular is quite massive and complex.”*

Maya sat back, her coffee forgotten. *The last resident. Unusual imagery. Botanical studies.*

Her eyes flicked to her own loom. A direct line, not just of blood, but of practice.

The article mentioned the historical society. Carlton County. Only an hour’s drive north.

The decision crystallized instantly. She had to see it.

She grabbed her phone and typed a text to the curator: *“Family emergency. Need to be offline today. Will touch base tomorrow. Apologies.”*

She hit send before she could second-guess the lie.

***

The Carlton County Historical Society was a modest, two-story brick building. The air inside smelled of old paper and polish.

A woman at the desk looked up. “Good morning! Are you here for the quilt exhibit?”

“Actually,” Maya said, her voice too loud in the hushed space, “I’m hoping to inquire about the Eleanor West bequest. The textiles from Hobb’s Hollow.”

The woman’s friendly expression didn’t change, but a subtle veil seemed to drop behind her eyes. “Oh. That material is in archival storage. It’s not on display.”

“I’m a textile artist,” Maya pressed, her heart thumping. “A research project on regional weaving traditions. I would be so grateful just for a look.”

The woman, Marge, studied her. “Well… I suppose there’s no harm. Mr. Finch is out all day.” She handed Maya a pair of white cotton gloves. “One box. And please be careful.”

Maya’s heart thrummed as she descended the narrow service stairs, the gloves a soft, weightless promise in her hand.

***

The basement storage was cool, smelling of concrete and aged fabric. Alone, Maya lifted the lid of the archival box.

The first piece was a sampler of plants—stinging nettle, yarrow, foxglove—rendered with breathtaking accuracy. But woven among them, in a darker thread, were roots that delved too deep, tangling in a dense, subterranean knot.

This was not decorative. This was a document.

The second piece was a winter forest of birch trees. The negative space between the trunks resolved into the faint, woven suggestion of figures standing among them, watching. The longer Maya looked, the more figures she saw.

She shivered.

The third piece made her breath stop.

It was a weaving of a loom. *Her* loom. The same dark wood, the same bone components. A woman was seated at it, her back to the viewer. On the woven web was a half-finished pattern: the beginning of a black-eyed Susan.

Maya’s hands began to shake. This was no coincidence. This was a lineage.

Frantic, she emptied the box. At the very bottom was a heavier, rolled piece. She unrolled it.

It was a family tree, woven as a great, spreading oak. She saw “Celia West (b. 1867).” She saw “Eleanor West (b. 1884).” A branch led to “Margaret (b. 1910).”

From Margaret, a single, tenuous thread stretched to the edge, where the weaving stopped abruptly. A name had been started in dark, crimson thread: “Ma—”

Maya’s mother was Margaret. She had named her only daughter Maya.

The room tilted. She gripped the edge of the table.

The loom upstairs wasn’t just an heirloom. It was a station in a relay race. She was the next runner. The unfinished name screamed at her.

A sudden, sharp noise from upstairs—the telephone—jolted her back.

She moved with frantic speed, re-wrapping the textiles, shoving them back in the box. She didn’t care about order. She had to get out.

***

She drove home in a blur. The vibrant hills now looked like the woven landscapes, full of hidden, watching forms.

Back at her studio, she didn’t turn on the lights. She walked slowly to the center of the room and stared at the floor where the flowers had been.

Nothing.

Then she looked at the loom. The woven flowers on the beam seemed to glow in the deepening dark. The shuttle lay in its cradle, a pale, beckoning finger.

The compulsion was immediate and overwhelming, a physical pull in her gut. It was underscored now with a terrible knowledge.

*This is my pattern. This is my inheritance.*

She didn’t fight it. The fight had been drained out of her.

With a strange, resigned calm, she sat at the loom, placed her hands on the warp threads, and picked up the bone shuttle. She began to weave where the flower tapestry had left off.

She didn’t think. She let her fingers remember what her mind did not know.

Under her hands, the pattern changed. The cheerful flowers were soon surrounded by, then overtaken by, a dense tapestry of forest floor. Rich soil, networks of white mycelium, gnarled tree roots. Ferns, evergreen boughs, deep, velvety shadows.

It was the forest from the archival weaving. It was Hobb’s Hollow.

She wove for hours as night fell completely. The shuttle flew back and forth, *clack-clack-clack*, a sound like a steady, ancient heartbeat. The forest grew on the cloth beam, dense and deep and dark.

Exhaustion finally overcame compulsion just before midnight. Her hands fell into her lap, numb and trembling. She was hollowed out, empty.

She looked at what she had created.

It was no longer a simple study. It was an ecosystem. It was a world.

And it was the most profound, terrifying piece of her life.

The loom stood in the center of it all, not as an object, but as the heart of a grove.

Maya didn’t scream. She simply stood, knuckles white on the doorframe, as the last vestige of doubt evaporated.

The patterns were not just records. They were instructions.

A soft, rhythmic *thump* broke the silence. Not from the loom. From the soil.

She watched, paralyzed, as the earth directly before the loom pulsed gently, like a heartbeat beneath the ferns. With each thump, a shape pushed upward, straining against the dark, fragrant loam. It was not a root. It was too regular, too deliberate.

A skeletal fingertip, woven not from bone, but from twisted, polished vine and ancient, blackened thorn, breached the surface. Then another. A hand was rising, not pushing its way out, but being *woven* up from the soil itself, thread by terrible thread, in perfect time with the silent, waiting loom.

It was a summons. And it was only the beginning of the pattern.
