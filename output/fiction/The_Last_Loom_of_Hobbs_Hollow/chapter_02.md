Maya pulled a skein of midnight wool from the basket, her fingers tracing the soft, cool fibers. A strange kinship with the loom and the yarn settled over her. She weave, her fingers moving with a rhythm both familiar and foreign as the loom appeared to guide her, the threads moving of their own accord. The world around her faded away, lost in the work.
Firelight flickered, casting long shadows on the walls. In the cabin’s silence, broken only by the soft rustle of yarn and the occasional crackle from the hearth, Maya’s mind whirled with a mix of excitement and trepidation. She was a maker, a weaver of stories and threads. This loom was the key to unlocking her true potential.
As she worked, that connection deepened, a kinship with the loom and yarn that thrummed through her hands. The threads guided her, moving of their own accord until the world faded away. Firelight flickered, and the cabin fell silent save for the footfalls of the wind and the fire’s occasional crackle.
The first draft of the pattern took shape—simple vines and leaves, the kind she might have created as a child. But the desigto shift, the threads twisting and turning inexplicably. Thorns sprouted from the vines, the leaves darkened, and the pattern transformed into something else entirely. A face emerged from the weave, its features sharp and angular, its eyes hollow and empty.
Maya’s breath hitched. She had never seen anything like it. The face was both familiar and alien, a reflection of something deep within her. Unease, a cold dread she couldn’t explain, coiled in her stomach. But she couldn’t stop. The looto have a will of its own, the threads moving independently. Control slipped from her fingers.
Firelight flickered, her shadow stretching grotesquely across the wall. The cabin smelled of smoke and old wood, the scent mingling with a faint, sweet-rotten odor lingering in the air. Maya’s fingers ached from the tension, but she couldn’t stop. The loom possessed its own will, the threads moving of their own accord. She was no longer in control.
The face in the weave began st its features shifting and twisting. The eyes filled with a dark, swirling void, and the mouth opened in a silent scream. A cold sweat broke out on Maya’s forehead, her heart pounding against her ribs. She tried to pull away, but her hands remained frozen, her fingers locked around the shuttle.
