      "title": "Blood in the Warp",
      "summary": "Maya reads the journal. Her grandmother, Elara, wrote of the loom's true purpose: to bind and placate a hungry entity from the hollow by weaving its desired patterns\u2014patterns that always depicted past sins and demanded future sacrifices.

      "title": "The Midpoint: Unraveled",
      "summary": "Terrified, Maya tries to destroy the loom with an axe. The wood doesn't splinter; it screams, and the backlash throws her across the room. The entity\u2014The Loomer\u2014now fully aware of her defiance, manifests in her studio: a towering figure of shadow, yarn, and spindle-bones. It speaks, not in words, but in the creak of tension and the pull of thread.

She learns the full history: the village used the loom to sacrifice outsiders to ensure good harvests and safety, weaving their fates into the land.

Drawing on her grandmother's journal and the elders' lore, she understands the only way to break a pattern is not to cut it, but to *unweave* it from the center.

      "title": "A Plain Weave",
      "summary": "The unweaving is complete. The loom shatters into inert, dead wood and dust. The psychic pressure lifts from Hobb's Hollow, leaving it just a lonely, quiet place. Maya survives, but is profoundly changed, her hair streaked white, her eyes holding the weight of what she witnessed.
