Chapter 1: The Inheritance of Knots

Rain fell on the Portland craft fair like a judgment. This was no gentle, misty Pacific Northwest drizzle, but a cold, spiteful downpour that seeped with malicious intent into the seams of Maya Vance’s handmade leather bags. A persistent, icy trickle traced a path down her neck from the tiny gap between the canopy and the stall frame. Wet asphalt, damp wool from passing coats, and the faint, defeated scent of espresso from a long-closed cart hung in the air. Each drop on her work landed as a tiny, chilling accusation. The rich chestnut dye of her signature satchel darkened to a mottled brown along the strap. Vegetable-tanned leather, painstakingly burnished to a warm glow with a deer bone and hours of sweat, now looked leprous under the sagging, buzzing fluorescent lights. Water bloomed in irregular patches, continents on a ruined map.

*Three months.* The drumbeat in her head synced with the drip from the canopy’s corner onto a cardboard box. *The lease is up in three months.* The landlord’s text had called it a “market adjustment.”

Around her, the fair was a symphony of damp misery. Canvas walls of neighboring stalls sagged, heavy and dark. A woman in a sleek, cobalt-blue waterproof jacket—the kind that rustled with synthetic finality—hurried past. Her eyes performed a dismissive scan, pausing on the water-stained satchel for only a microsecond. A flicker of something like pity, or worse, satisfaction, then her gaze locked onto the bright, vinyl-covered stall twenty feet down selling mass-printed cotton totes with arch slogans. A line had formed there. A burst of laughter echoed, sharp and alien against the patter of rain.

Behind her sternum, the hot, sour knot tightened another turn—a clenched fist of failure just below her ribs.

“Rough day, huh?”

Maya turned, arranging her face into wry resilience, a practiced mask. Ben from the adjacent pottery stall offered a sympathetic wince. His own glazed mugs, with their perfect, uniform drips, looked intentionally rustic. His pity felt like a scratchy, suffocating blanket.

“Just waiting for the monsoon season to pass.” Her voice came out tighter than intended, the words clipped.

“Your bags are heirlooms, Maya. The right person just hasn’t walked by yet.”

He said it with a gentle certainty that made her want to scream. He could afford that certainty. His wife had a dental practice. She nodded, unable to trust her voice again, and pretended to adjust a clutch purse. Her fingers traced the precise, waxed thread of the saddle stitch. Each stitch was a tiny anchor.

Gallery light and the murmur of departing guests from last night’s hopeful opening felt suddenly distant, as if viewed from the far end of a tunnel, the night’s chill already seeping into her bones. Turning her collar up against the damp, she walked to her car. The weight of the evening settled in the silence between the closing door and the engine’s reluctant, grinding turn. Outside the windshield, the world dissolved into streaks of light and shadow, the vibrant opening now a sealed box in the past.

Driving back to her studio became a slow, grey blur. The old Subaru, smelling of wet leather and old coffee, crawled through slick streets as the gallery's glow faded in the rearview mirror, swallowed by rain. Every red light stretched into an eternity, a hollow pause filled only by the rhythmic, metronome thump of the wipers and the low groan of the defroster fighting a losing battle. The city passed by like a forgotten film reel, buildings smeared into dark, impersonal shapes. She didn’t remember the turns, only the mechanical actions—signal, brake, accelerate—her mind still trapped in that bright room, replaying forced smiles, the clink of cheap wine glasses, and the one conversation that had changed everything.

A man in a beautifully cut blazer had picked up her most ambitious piece, a backpack with intricate tooled floral patterns. “Exquisite workmanship,” he’d said, his thumb testing the pull of a zipper. Then, without looking at her, “Your pricing is… aspirational.” He’d set it down as if it were suddenly fragile. The word had hung in the air, a verdict. *Aspirational.* A polite word for delusional.

Pulling up to the studio’s dim facade in a block of converted warehouses offered no comfort, just a cold space waiting to be filled with the same quiet now humming inside her. Sodium light from the streetlamp painted the puddles in the potholed lot a sickly orange. On the passenger seat, her unsold bags lay piled in a mute, accusatory heap. The one on top, the stained satchel, seemed to stare with its dark, blotched eye.

Inside, the chill was deeper than the outside air, stored in the concrete floor and metal rafters. The industrial lights buzzed and flickered to life at the flick of a switch, casting hard shadows. No solace came from the usual smells of oak bark tannin and neatsfoot oil, no scent of potential. Tonight, it just smelled like a workshop. Like labor with no reward.

She dumped the inventory onto the scarred wooden worktable with a thud that echoed in the cavernous space. The bags slumped, lifeless.

*Is this it?* The stranger in the mirror propped against the brick wall had her face—pale under the harsh light, a smudge of fatigue under each eye. *The grand culmination? A damp stall and a mountain of debt?* The numbers began their litany: materials loan, credit card, last month’s rent, next month’s rent. A geometry of collapse.

Her phone buzzed on the table, a violent vibration against the wood. A text from her father.

*How did the fair go, sweetheart? Thinking of you!*

Attached was a photo of him and his new wife, Linda, grinning on a golf course, sunlight dappling their faces. A world away.

Her throat closed. She typed back—, her thumbs clumsy. *Wet! Slow. But okay.* His immediate reply: *Proud of you no matter what.* Followed by a heart emoji. The knot behind her sternum threatened to become a sob, a physical wave.of heat behind her eyes. She swallowed it down, the taste of salt and shame. His unconditional pride was a weight, heavier somehow than his disappointment would have been. It left no room for the truth. Seeking distraction, a task for her hands, she turned to the day’s mail, a small stack on the corner of her desk, shoved between a jar of rivets and a half-finished pattern. Junk, a flyer for a wholesaler, a final notice for the utilities (she ripped that in half without opening it), and a formal, cream-colored envelope. The paper was thick, expensive. No return address. A postmark from Haven’s End, Maine. The name was a whisper from childhood, from stories told in low voices after she was supposed to be asleep. Frowning, she slit it open with her round knife, the blade sharp and familiar in her hand. To Ms. Maya Vance, it began, in crisp, black ink. You are hereby notified that you are a named beneficiary in the Last Will and Testament of Eleanor Margaret Vance. Her great-aunt. A name from hushed, complicated family stories. “Eccentric,” her father called her, a word he used to mean difficult. “Lived alone in that big old house on the coast. Never quite forgave the world for something.” Her mother, before she left, had called her “the knot-tier,” said with a shrug that dismissed both the woman and the phrase. A sharp, humorless laugh escaped Maya, a short puff of air in the silent studio. An inheritance. From the family ghost. It would probably be a token amount, a final cryptic gesture from a woman who’d met Maya exactly twice: once when she was a sullen seven-year-old, and again at her grandfather’s funeral, where Eleanor Margaret Vance had worn a dress that might have been made of old curtains and hadn’t spoken a word to anyone. Still, her pulse, traitorously, quickened. She pulled out her laptop, the fan whirring in the quiet. A quick search found Sterling & Gable, Attorneys at Law, in remote Haven’s End. The website was a single page, a scanned image of a letterhead. It looked like a place time had decided to bypass. For a minute, she let herself fantasize. She leaned back in her creaking chair, the fantasy bright and breathless behind her closed eyes. What if it was money? Real money? Enough to cover a year’s rent, to pay back Dad for the “investment loan” he’d insisted was a gift but she knew he needed, to buy a proper industrial sewing machine, to breathe… She saw a version of herself not hunched over this table, but upright, confident, the stain of today washed clean. Then reality settled back in, cold as the floor under her feet. People like her didn’t get windfalls. They got knots. Complex, gnarly problems. This would be a bureaucratic headache, a request to clear out a dusty attic of mothballed regrets, probably involving a derelict cat and boxes of National Geographics. She’d have to pay for the flight, the time off, the storage unit. She left the letter on the desk—a stark, creamy rectangle of alien possibility against the grey sprawl of her overdue bills and coffee-ringed sketches. It was just another piece of paper. But its edge was sharp. It was a thread, however faint, leading out of her tangled present. She didn’t pull it, but she couldn’t bring herself to throw it away. Arthur Sterling’s voice the next morning was dry and precise, like pages turning in a very old book. He had called exactly at nine, as promised. There was no small talk. “The primary asset is her residence, ‘The Aerie.’ It is bequeathed to you. With a condition.” Maya’s heart gave a feeble, hopeful flutter against her ribs. A house. A physical thing. She could sell it. The number, any number, danced in her mind. It could be a lifeline. “What condition?” She was standing in her studio, clutching the phone too tightly, watching a pigeon strut on the skylight. “You must reside at The Aerie for a continuous period of ninety days. Full-time. No extended absences. After that period, full title transfers to you. Fail to meet the condition, and the property passes to a secondary beneficiary, a local historical society. You would receive a cash sum of five thousand dollars instead.” Maya sat down heavily on her stool. The wood groaned. “Ninety days? I have a business here. I can’t just abandon it.” The protest was automatic, the armor she wore. Even as she said it, her eyes swept the room: the water-stained satchel drying on a rack, its bloomed patches permanent; the empty stall folded in the corner; the spreadsheet open on her screen, the red numbers now a permanent background hue. The silence on the other end of the line seemed to amplify it all. “The terms are ironclad, Ms. Vance,” Sterling said, not unkindly, but with a granite finality. “Drafted by your aunt herself. Very specific. You’d need to take up residence by the end of next month. The utilities are on, the taxes are paid. The house is… ready.” A prison sentence. That was her inheritance. A chore wrapped in legal parchment. Three months in a dead woman’s house in a town whose name sounded like an ending. “What’s in the house?” she asked, her voice flat, all the earlier fantasy leached out of it. “Furniture? Junk?” “The contents are extensive. She was a collector. Of a sort.” He paused, and she heard the faint crackle of the line, or perhaps him choosing his words. “It includes all her… work. Your great-aunt was an artist. Of a kind.” An artist. The word landed differently now, coming from this dry lawyer. Not “eccentric,” but “artist.” It carried a weight, a claim to a purpose Maya understood in her bones, even as she was failing at it. The silence after Sterling hung up, after giving her the instructions to confirm, was absolute and profound. The usual studio sounds—the distant whir of a forklift next door, the drip of the sink—seemed to have been sucked out of the world. Maya stared at her hands—the clever hands her aunt had once noted, when seven-year-old Maya had shown her a clumsily braided bracelet. “You have the hands for it,” the old woman had said, her own gnarled fingers closing over Maya’s for a second, her touch surprisingly warm. Then she’d turned away. Maya stared at those hands now, stained with dye, a fresh cut across a knuckle from yesterday’s knife work. Then at the spreadsheet bleeding The search yielded little: an archived listing from thirty years ago for a minor group show at a now-defunct cooperative gallery in Rockland, Maine. The title of her piece was listed simply as “Constellation #7”. Medium: Mixed fibers. No image. A ghost in the machine.

Maya was about to close the tab when a sponsored link, an obituary aggregator, caught her eye. She clicked, her breath held. The entry for Eleanor Margaret Vance was sparse, confirming only the date of death. But below it, in a section titled ‘Survived By’, the name wasn’t blank. It listed a single person: Maya Vance, niece.

Maya huddled on the edge of her bed, feet in worn canvas shoes, and pulled a thread from the fraying seam. It was an old habit, something that'd begun when she was a child, surrounded by the rough, unfinished textures of her parents' thrift store. The sound of the thread unraveling echoed in the stillness of her studio apartment, a counterpoint to the quiet tension in her chest.

She turned to the cream-colored letter, now crumpled on the bedside table. The words jumped out in her mind: "Eleanor Margaret Vance, at the old Oak Street farmhouse. Bring your best." The farmhouse, a place she'd never been. Eleanor Margaret Vance, her reclusive aunt, now gone. Yet the letter felt like an open door, one that swung only partially ajar, leaving a sliver of promise in the darkness.

A faint creak from the floorboards beneath the bedboards caught her attention. She picked up the worn wooden box, old and beautifully hand-carved with what looked like intertwining knotwork patterns. Lifting the lid, she caught the scent of old leather, wood, and what might've been sandalwood, carried by her grandmother before her. A bundle of soft cloth, embroidered with the same pattern as the box, spilled out – her mother's grandmother's quilt, and a note in her Aunt Eleanor Margaret Vance's familiar, looping script.

The air left her lungs. She was in the system. She was the heir, the only connection. But as she stared, a cold, meticulous clarity cut through the shock. The lawyer’s letter had been addressed to Maya Vance, Artist*. Not the name on her driver’s license. Not the name her father knew. It was the name she’d only begun using professionally, on her failed online shop, a mere six months ago.

How did a reclusive aunt she’d never met, who died over a year ago, know to use that specific, nascent alias? The cream-colored letter no longer seemed to glow; it seemed to watch. The knot at her sternum wasn’t just a tangle to pick at. It was a lure. And she had just proven, with a single keystroke, that she was already hooked.
