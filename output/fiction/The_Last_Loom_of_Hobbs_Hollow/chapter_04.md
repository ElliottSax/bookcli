The air in the historical society’s main hall was thick with the scent of old paper, lemon oil, and dust motes dancing in the slanted afternoon light. Maya’s fingers, calloused from her own work, traced the carvings on the loom’s massive frame. The wood was not just smooth; it was like polished river stone, cool and dense, seeming to draw the warmth from her skin. Each groove intentional, a channel. The patterns were more than intricate; they were a narrative she could feel but not read. The vines weren’t merely twisting—they were *strangling*, their thorns carved with such vicious precision she half-expected to prick her finger and draw blood. The flowers bloomed in a riot of captured color: a crimson so deep it verged on black at the petal’s heart, a gold that appeared to hold the last glint of a vanished sun, a violet so vibrant it hummed against the dark oak. It was as if the loom itself was a living, sleeping entity, and its breath was the quiet, ancient energy that raised the fine hairs on her arms.
The woman from the front desk, Margaret, watched from a respectful distance, her hands clasped over a sensible wool cardigan. Her smile was not just knowing; it was a carefully curated artifact itself, worn smooth by years of sharing this story with the politely curious and the genuinely unnerved. Maya could see she was assessing which category this new visitor fell into.
“Eleanor was quite the artist,” Margaret said, her voice echoing slightly in the high-ceilinged room. “Her work is… singular. Not like anything you’d find in a typical folk art collection. It doesn’t simply depict nature. It seems to argue with it.”

Maya nodded, unable to pull her eyes away from a particularly convoluted knot of thorns. “It’s confrontational. The beauty is there, but it’s… demanding. It doesn’t ask to be admired. It insists on being felt.” She surprised herself with her own words. This wasn’t her usual analytical art-historical language; it was something raw, pulled from the same place her own midnight weaving came from.
Margaret’s chuckle was dry, a rustle of fallen leaves. “That’s a perceptive way to put it. Less perceptive folks simply called it cursed.” She paused, letting the word hang. “There was a story—oh, a silly local tale—that the flowers in her tapestries would find root in the real world. That if she wove a rose, a briar would sprout by someone’s doorstep. Superstition, of course. But Eleanor… she nurtured those stories. She’d never confirm them, but she’d smile that secret smile and say the loom was less a tool and more a conduit. A way to give her visions weight and texture, to pull threads from one realm into another.”

Maya’s breath hitched, a tangible knot in her throat. The words didn’t just send a shiver down her spine; they mapped a cold, familiar geography onto her own fears. *A conduit.* That was the exact, forbidden word she’d circled in her own mind during her 3 a.m. weaving sessions, when the line between her hands creating and her hands *channeling* blurred into terror. To have it spoken here, in this hushed hall, was like having a private incantation overheard. The dread was icy, but beneath it, a spark of fierce validation caught fire. She wasn’t hallucinating. She wasn’t alone.
“Do you have any of her tapestries here?” Maya asked, her voice low, barely disturbing the dusty silence. “I need to see the result of the conduit.”

Margaret’s eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly. *Need.* Not *want.* “We have a few. They’re kept in the lower archival room. The light is… controlled.” She turned, her sensible shoes whispering on the wide-plank floor. “Follow me.”

They moved through a narrow doorway hidden behind a mix of a benign pastoral scene—ironic, Maya thought. The transition was immediate. The dry, papery warmth of the main hall gave way to a cellar chill that smelled of damp stone and forgotten things. The short flight of stairs groaned underfoot, each step a protest. The lower room was a cavern of shadows, lit by a few low-voltage lamps that cast more pools of darkness than illumination. Walls were lined with steel shelves holding document boxes, their labels faded. In the center, under a dedicated spotlight, stood a long, glass-topped display case like a sarcophagus.
Maya approached, her heartbeat a frantic drum in her ears. Inside, three tapestries were mounted on neutral fabric. Time had muted their colors, but not their presence. They were stunning, technically masterful, but their beauty was a trap. The central piece depicted a garden at twilight. The flowers were exquisitely rendered, but their stems intertwined like grasping fingers, and at the border, the lush greenery subtly mutated into barbed wire. She leaned in, her breath fogging the glass. The details were microscopic, impossible. Within the velvet depths of a woven pansy, she could see the faint, perfect striations of pollen on a stamen. On a poppy petal, the delicate veininto pulse with a captured memory of sap.
“These are… impossible,” she breathed, the word carrying its full weight.
“Eleanor had a preternatural eye,” Margaret agreed, standing beside her. “People said she could make you smell the blooms. That the scent of lavender and damp earth would fill a room when she was deep in a piece. A psychological trick, I’m sure. Suggestion is a powerful thing.”

*Lavender.* The scent from her studio, the phantom perfume that lingered after the impossible withering. It was no longer a coincidence; it was a clue, a breadcrumb on a trail she was now compelled to follow. The connection was a live wire in her chest.
“The stories about the flowers coming to life,” Maya began, choosing her words with care, trying to sound academically detached and failing. “Did they ever specify *how*? Was i merely st… spontaneous generation? Or did it require something? A condition?” She was thinking of her own tears, the saltwater that had fallen onto her weaving. A catalyst.
Margaret was silent for a long moment. The hum of the climate control system filled the void. When she spoke, her curated guide persona had slipped, revealing something older and more cautious beneath. “The stories were vague. Fear usually is. But there was one thread… a notion that it wasn’t the finished tapestry that held the power, but the *act*. That the living thread, passed through the carved conduit, could… bleed through. That strong emotion in the weaver—obsession, grief, joy—could act as a kind of dye, staining the real world.” She shook her head, as if physically dispelling the thought. “But these are the tales old wives tell to keep children from wandering the woods at night. You understand.”

Maya understood that Margaret was now warning her, not just informing her. “Of course,” Maya replied softly. “But to understand an artist, sometimes you have to understand the myths they lived within. Do you have any of Eleanor’s personal effects? Journals, letters? The tools of the act, onlyjust the result?”

Margaret studied her, a long, appraising look that seemed to ory the shadows under Maya’s eyes, the slight tremor in her hands. “The archives are extensive,” she said finally, a non-answer.
“Please,” Ma answered, and the word was stripped bare, full of a hunger she could no longer conceal.
That single syllable seemede something. Margaret gave a curt nod. “This way. And mind your step; the floor is uneven.”

They went deeper, through an arched stone doorway that like entering a crypt. The air was colder here, with a metallic tang. This room was smaller, dominated by a massive oak table. Upon it, arranged with archival care, was a collection of objects that shockingly intimate: a pair of brass scissors, green with verdigris; a pincushion shaped like a heart, the fabric worn thin; a spectacles case; a bundle of letters tied with faded ribbon; and a small, leather-bound journal, its cover cracked like a dry riverbed.
But it was the other items that arrested Maya. A series of small wood carvings, not of flowers, but of strange, gnarly knots and twisted roots that looked almost like agonized figures. And beside them, a shallow box lined with velvet, holding a collection of dried flowers. Not pretty pressed souvenirs, but blossoms that looked *harvested* from the tapestries themselves—a brittle, dark rose, a sprig of lavender that still held a ghost of color, a thorn as long as Maya’s finger, black and wicked.
She bypassed the letters, her hand drawn magnetically to the journal. Lifting it, the leather was supple from much handling. She opened it carefully. The script inside was elegant, flowing, and utterly incomprehensible. It was no language she had ever seen—not Cyrillic, not Arabic, no ancient alphabet. The symbols were organic, some like looping vines, others like sharp, angular thorns, arranged in dense blocks that less like writing and more like circuitry or incantation.
“Do you know what language this is?” Maya whispered, her voice swallowed by the room’s stillness.
“No one has ever identified it,” Margaret said, her own voice hushed in the sacred space of mystery. “Linguists from the university were baffled. Some suggested it was a private cipher. Others…” She trailed off.
“Others what?”
“murmuredrs said it wasn’t a language meant for the mind, but for the hands. A weaver’s notation. A pattern language for things beyond thread.” Margaret folded her arms tightly. “She called it ‘the root-tongue.’ Said it was the language of growth and decay, of the push beneath the soil.”

Maya’s fingers trembled as they hovered over a page. She couldn’t read it, but her *hands* seemed to recoappeared to A muscle memory twitched in her palm, a phantom echo of her shuttle moving. She had a sudden, visceral understanding: this was the source code. The carved loom was the hardware, the tapestries were the output, and this journal contained the primal software. The energy wasn’t just *in* the pages; it was the pages. It was a silent, screaming vibration against her skin.
“She believed she was translatwhispered” Maya said, the realization dawning with terrible clarity. “Not creating from imagination, but translating something that already existed in… in that other realm.”

Margaret said nothing. Her silence was confirmation enough.
Maya gently set the journal down, her eyes moving to the dried flowers. She pointed to the lavender. “Did these… come from her garden? Or from her work?”

A long pause. “The accession nstated,” Margaret said slowly, “are unclear.”

The evasion was all the answer Maya needed. The proof was here, in this cold room. The conduit was real. The bleed-through was real. Eleanor had mastered it, or had been mastered by it. And now Maya, with her own carved loom and her sleepless nights and her tears that brought forth impossible life and sudden death, was on the same path.
“There’s more, isn’t there?” Maya asked, turning to face Margaret fully. The academic pretense was gone. This was now a conversation between two women standing at the edge of a precipice. “You wouldn’t have brought me down hsimplyjust to show me a journal I can’t read. What else did she leave behind?”

Margaret held her gaze, a war behind her eyes. There was a duty to preservation, and a duty to warning. Finally, with a sigh that seemed to de, she walked to the far wall, where a large archival cabinet stood. She worked a key from her cardigan pocket, the click echoing sharply. The drawer she opened was deep. From it, she lifted not a document, but an object wrapped in acid-free tissue paper.
She carried it to the table and laid it down. With deliberate care, she unfolded the paper.
Nestled inside was a weaving shuttle. But it was unlike any Maya had ever seen. It was carved from the same dark, dense wood as the loom upstairs, its surface a continuous, swirling narrative of vines and thorns. And set into its heart, like a trapped eye, was a smooth, milky river stone, veined with threads of obsidian. It was profoundly beautiful and utterly unsettling.
“This was her personal shuttle,” Margaret said, her voice reverent and fearful. “It was found with her. The story goes… she was never without it. That she believed it wasn’t just a tool, but a key. The final piece of the conduit.”

Maya stared, transfixed. Her own hands empty, aching. This was the missing piece. The journal held the theory, the loom was the engine, but this… this was the wand. The focused instrument.
“May I?” she asked, her voice hoarse.
Margaret’s hand twitched as if to stop her, then fell. “For a moment.”

Maya reached out. The moment her fingers made contact, a jolt went through her—not of electricity, but of *recognition*. The wood was warmer than it should be in the chilly room. The stone at its center not like mineral, but like something organic, a solidified piece of something else. A low, almost sub-audible hum seemed to resonate inappeared tos of her wrist. In her mind’s eye, for a fleeting second, she didn’t see the archival cellar; she saw the vibrant, over-saturated garden from the central tapestry, felt a sun that was too warm, smelled the overwhelming perfume of a thousand blooms. The vision was gone as quickly as it came, leaving a throbbing behind her eyes.
She snatched her hand back, gasping.
“You it,” Margaret stated flatly. It wasn’t a question.
“What is it?” Maya breathed, cradling her hand.
“A remarkedcy,” Margaret said, her face grim. She carefully re-wrap the shuttle, sealing it away. “And a warning. Eleanor’s work consumed her. The last years of her life… she became a recluse. The townsfolk d merely t just fear her work; they feared *her*. They said the garden around her cottage didn’t just grow; it *watched*. That the flowers had eyes.” She finished wrapping and glanced squarely at Maya. “You have the look about you. The same look she had in the only photograph we have of her later years. A look of seeing things woven into the world that others cannot. So I will ask you, my dear, as someone who has been the custodian of this mystery for a long time: are you seeking answers, or are you seeking a path?”

The question hung in the cold air. Maya looked from the wrapped shuttle to the journal to the box of dead, potent flowers. She thought of her own silent studio, her own loom waiting, her own half-finished tapestry that yearned for completion. She had come for answers, but now she understood the answers were not facts, but instructions. The path was here, laid out in carved wood and cryptic script.
“I don’t think I have a notedce anymore,” Maya said, and the truth of it was both terrifying and liberating. “The path found me.”

Margaret nodded slowly, a look of profound resignation in her eyes. She had done her duty, and in doing so, had perhaps passed the torch. “Then take what you need from this,” she said, gesturing to the table. “But remember, a conduit works both ways. You might pull something through. But you might also send something of yourself back into the weave. The price is rarely paid in coin.”

Maya’s fingers returned to the journal. This time, the touch was deliberate. She would take this. She would learn this root-tongue. She would understand the key. The plot points of her quest remained—the loom, the journal, the mystery of Eleanor—but they were now saturated with sensory dread, the deep, churning thoughts of a woman stepping onto a precipice, the loaded dialogue of a secret passed between keepers, and the visceral, chilling scene of a descent into an archive that less like a repository of the past and more like the antechamber of a living, hungry legacy. The way forward was clear, and it was woven with thorns.
