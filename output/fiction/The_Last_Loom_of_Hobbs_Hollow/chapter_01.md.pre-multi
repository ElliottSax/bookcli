**Chapter 1: The Inheritance of Knots**

The rain fell on the Portland craft fair like a judgment. It wasn’t the gentle, misty Pacific Northwest rain of postcards. It was a cold, spiteful drizzle that seeped into the seams of Maya Vance’s handmade leather bags with malicious intent.

Each drop was a tiny, chilling accusation.

She watched, helpless, as the rich chestnut dye of her signature satchel darkened to a mottled brown along the strap. The vegetable-tanned leather, painstakingly burnished to a warm glow, now looked leprous under the sagging lights. *Three months*, the drumbeat in her head began. *The lease is up in three months.*

Around her, the fair was a symphony of damp misery. A woman in a sleek, cobalt-blue waterproof jacket hurried past. Her eyes performed a dismissive scan, pausing on the water-stained satchel for only a microsecond before locking onto the bright stall twenty feet down—the one selling mass-printed cotton totes. A line had formed there. Laughter echoed.

The hot, sour knot behind Maya’s sternum tightened another turn.

“Rough day, huh?”

Maya turned, arranging her face into wry resilience. Ben from the adjacent pottery stall offered a sympathetic wince. His pity felt like a blanket she didn’t want.

“Just waiting for the monsoon season to pass,” she said, her voice tighter than she’d intended.

“Your bags are heirlooms, Maya. The right person jusShe nodded, unable to trust her voice again, and pretended to adjust a clutch purseThe gallery’s warm light and the murmur of departing guests felt suddenly distant, as if she were watching it all from the far end of a tunnel, the chill of the night already seeping into her bones. She turned her collar up against the damp and walked to her car, the weight of the evening settling in the silence between the closing door and the engine’s reluctant turn. The world outside the windshield dissolved into streaks of light and shadow, the vibrant opening now a sealed box in the past.

The drive back to her studio was a slow, grey blur. Her old Subaru crawled through the slick streets as the gallery's glow faded in the rearview mirror, swallowed by the rain. Every red light was an eternity, a hollow pause filled only by the rhythmic thump of the wipers. The city passed by like a forgotten film reel, buildings smeared into dark, impersonal shapes. She didn’t remember the turns, only the mechanical actions—signal, brake, accelerate—her mind still back in that bright room, replaying the forced smiles and the one conversation that had changed everything. The studio, when she finally pulled up to its dim facade, offered no comfort, just a cold space waiting to be filled with the same quiet that now hummed inside her.ternity. In the passenger seat, her unsold bags were piled in a mute, accusatory heap.usatory heap.

Inside the cold studio, the usual solace didn’t come. She dumped the inventory onto a worktable with a thud. *Is this it?* she asked the stranger in the mirror. *The grand culmination? A damp stall and a mountain of debt?*

Her phone buzzed. A text from her father. *How did the fair go, sweetheart? Thinking of you!*

She typed back, *Wet! Slow. But okay.*

His immediate reply: *Proud of you no matter what.*

The knot threatened to become a sob. She swallowed it down.

Seeking distraction, she turned to the day’s mail. Junk, a flyer, and a formal, cream-colored envelope. No return address. A postmark from Haven’s End, Maine.

Frowning, she slit it open.

*To Ms. Maya Vance,* it began. *You are hereby notified that you are a named beneficiary in the Last Will and Testament of Eleanor Margaret Vance.*

Her great-aunt. A name from hushed, complicated family stories. “Eccentric,” her father called her. “Lived alone in that big old house on the coast.”

A sharp, humorless laugh escaped Maya. An inheritance. It would probably be a token amount, a final cryptic gesture.

Still, she pulled out her laptop. A quick search found Sterling & Gable, Attorneys at Law, in remote Haven’s End.

For a minute, she let herself fantasize. *What if it was money? Real money? Enough to cover a year’s rent, to pay back Dad…*

The fantasy was bright and breathless.

Then reality settled back in. People like her didn’t get windfalls. They got knots. This would be a bureaucratic headache, a request to clear out a dusty attic.

She left the letter on the desk—a stark, creamy contrast to her grey bills. It was just another piece of paper. But it was a thread leading out of her tangled present.

Arthur Sterling’s voice the next morning was dry and precise. “The primary asset is her residence, ‘The Aerie.’ It is bequeathed to you with a condition.”

Maya’s heart gave a feeble flutter. A house. She could sell it.

“What condition?”

“You must reside at The Aerie for a continuous period of ninety days. Full-time. After that, full title transfers to you. Fail to meet it, and the property passes to another. You would receive five thousand dollars instead.”

Maya sat down heavily. “Ninety days? I have a business here. I can’t just abandon it.”

Even as she said it, she saw the water-stained satchel. The empty stall.

“The terms are ironclad,” Sterling said. “You’d need to take up residence by the end of next month.”

A prison sentence. That was her inheritance. A chore.

“What’s in the house?” she asked, her voice flat.

“The contents are extensive. She was a collector. Of a sort. It includes all her… work. Your great-aunt was an artist.”

The silence after Sterling hung up was absolute.

Maya stared at her hands—the clever hands her aunt had once noted. Then at the spreadsheet bleeding red numbers on her screen. The proud lie she told her father curdled on her tongue.

*What,* she thought, *am I staying for?*

Ninety days. A house. An artist’s legacy. A knot she was meant to untangle.

Driven by a reckless impulse, she typed her aunt’s name into a forgotten corner of the web. The search yielded little: an archived gallery listing for a minor group show decades ago. She almost closed the tab when a thumbnail image loaded. It was a tapestry titled *Convergence*.

Maya’s breath hitched. The design was an abstract swirl of ochre and slate, but at its center was a clear, deliberate shape: a smooth, oval river stone, exactly like the one she’d carried for years. The one she’d found, she’d always believed, by chance.

The apartment chilled. This was no coincidence. Sterling’s words echoed: *nothing about her was without purpose.*

Her aunt hadn’t just known Maya was an artist. She had been watching. And the house wasn’t just an inheritance. It was an invitation, or a test, crafted long before Maya ever knew she was being studied.
