Chapter 5: Blood in the Warp

The journal smelled of cedar and damp earth. Maya pressed her back against the cold brick wall, as if its solidity could ground her. Between her and the kitchenette, the loom dominated the space. No longer a curious artifact—it had transformed into a patient, angular beast.

Its polished bone frame gleamed under the pendant light like old teeth bared in a silent snarl.

Outside, a siren wailed, too close. The clock on the wall marked each second with a loud, metallic click. To Maya, each click was a grain of sand she couldn’t afford to lose.

Her grandmother’s handwriting was a precise, sloping script. Maya’s own hands felt clumsy as she turned the brittle page. The paper whispered, like leaves skittering over a grave.

October 12th, 1978

The hunger is quiet today. It sleeps in the warp. I have woven the pattern of the Miller boy’s drowning at the old quarry, and for now, the hollow is sated.

These respites are the gifts it gives. They are also the hooks, baited with normalcy. Do not be fooled, my heir. The quiet is only ever a pause between breaths.

Maya’s breath hitched. Miller boy’s drowning. She traced the words with a trembling finger.

This wasn’t the grandmother she remembered. This was a stranger. A chronicler of drownings.

A draft snaked across the floorboards from the loom. The pendant light swayed. Shadows stretched on the wall like a ribcage breathing.

She forced herself to read on.

The loom is not a tool for creation. It is a mouth. A bargaining table.

The entity in the hollow—some called it The Loomer—does not think as we do. It is an appetite. It feeds on consequence, on the tangible echo of suffering given form.

We give it a tragedy, perfectly rendered in thread and blood and stolen pigment, and it grants the village another season. We are curators of a sacrificial gallery.

“No,” Maya whispered. The word was swallowed by the silence.

She shoved the journal away. It thumped softly on the floor. A mouth. The space between the warp threads looked like a dark maw.

A memory surfaced, sharp and unbidden: Gran teaching her to knit. “Every stitch is a choice. You must pay attention to the tension. Too tight, and it strangles. Too loose, and it unravels.”

At the time, it was a lesson in craft. Now, it sounded like a grim philosophy.

She pulled the journal back. The cedar smell was cloying. She turned several pages.

April 3rd, 1979: Wove the Harper barn fire. Needed soot from the central beam. The dreams were loud. I saw the flames in my sleep for a month.

November 11th, 1981: The Carter girl’s stillbirth. A difficult pattern. The silence after was profound.

Maya’s stomach churned. This was a ledger of pain. Her grandmother’s hands had mixed ash and tears to paint pictures of despair.

She flipped toward the end. The handwriting grew hurried.

September 15th, Last Year: The hunger is changing. The patterns it demands are… sharper. More personal.

October 30th, Last Year: It showed me a pattern. A tangle of crimson and steel-grey, with a core of vibrant, living green. It feels like an ending. The hollow wants the source.

The final entry was dated just a week before Gran’s letter.

The green thread is here. It is Maya. The Pattern-Man has tasted her potential. It wants a masterpiece. It wants her story.

I cannot… I will not weave it. But the hunger is at the door. The pact must be fulfilled, or it will take everything.

Maya’s blood turned to ice.

The vibrant, living green. Her thread. She was the subject. Her life was to be the next offering.

Gran had chosen Maya over the town. And the entity, cheated, was coming to collect.

A violent shiver wracked her. She stumbled to the window and yanked it open, leaning into the damp night. The air was foul with rain and exhaust, but it was real. It didn’t smell of cedar and dread.

When her heart slowed, she turned back.

Her eyes went to the small box of threads. The one on top was a brilliant, mossy green. Her color.

A new terror dawned. If the entity wanted a pattern woven, and Gran was gone… who would weave it?

The knowledge in the journal was a dreadful inheritance. The loom, the threads, the hunger—they were now hers.

“I can’t,” she said aloud, her voice edged with panic. “I won’t do it.”

But the journal’s words echoed: “The pact must be fulfilled, or it will take everything.”

Could she live with weaving her own destruction to save them?

The rational part of her mind screamed that this was insanity. Folklore. Psychosis.

Yet, the evidence was tactile: the whispering threads, the sentient shadow, the prophetic horrors in the journal. Reality had frayed.

Maya's fingers tightened around the pendant, the wooden disc a comforting weight against her skin. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she recalled the night she'd left it on her nightstand. It was as if the loom had somehow sensed her absence, reached out to claim it.

She took a deep breath, letting the scent of cedar and damp earth fill her lungs. The kitchenette seemed to shrink around her, the pendant light casting an eerie glow on the walls. The siren's wail grew louder, a cacophony of sound that threatened to shatter the fragile calm.

Maya's eyes drifted to the loom, its polished bone frame seeming to leer at her. She felt a surge of revulsion mixed with fascination. What was it doing? Why was it calling to her?

She forced herself to focus on the journal, her grandmother's handwriting a blur as she read the words. The Miller boy's drowning. The pattern of the warp. It was all so... deliberate.

A faint scratching sound echoed from the loom, like fingernails on wood. Maya's heart skipped a beat. She felt a presence behind her, a presence that seemed to be watching her.

"Maya?" a low voice called out from the hallway.

Maya's head jerked up, her eyes scanning the darkness. "Ava?" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

The scratching grew louder, more insistent. Maya's fingers tightened around the pendant, her skin prickling with gooseflesh. She felt a presence moving towards her, a presence that seemed to be drawn to the loom.

Ava stepped into the kitchenette, her eyes fixed on the loom. "What's going on?" she asked, her voice laced with concern.

Maya's fingers tightened around the pendant, the wooden disc a comforting weight against her palm. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she recalled the night she'd left it on her nightstand. It was as if the loom had somehow sensed her absence, reached out to claim it.

She took a deep breath, letting the scent of cedar and damp earth fill her lungs. The journal lay open on the loom's frame, the words blurring together as she stared at the page. The siren's wail grew louder, a cacophony of sound that seemed to seep into her very bones.

Maya's eyes drifted to the clock on the wall, the metallic clicks echoing through the small space like a countdown. She felt a bead of sweat trickle down her forehead, and her skin prickled with gooseflesh. The air was heavy with tension, the silence between the siren's wails a palpable thing.

She rose from her crouched position, her joints stiff from the cold brick floor. Her eyes roamed the room, taking in the familiar contours of the kitchenette, the worn linoleum, and the old, wooden cabinets. It was a space that had been her sanctuary, her refuge from the world outside.

As she moved, the pendant's rhythm seemed to synchronize with her heartbeat, a steady pulse that calmed her racing thoughts. Maya's gaze fell upon the loom, its angular frame looming over her like a sentinel. The pendant light cast eerie shadows on the walls, making the space feel like a cave.

She approached the loom cautiously, her hand still clutching the pendant. The siren's wail grew louder, a discordant note that clashed with the pendant's soothing rhythm. Maya's breath caught in her throat as she reached out to touch the loom's frame.

The wood was cool to the touch, smooth beneath her fingertips. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that the loom's surface was slick with a fine layer of oil. It was a subtle detail, one that spoke to the loom's age and the countless hands that had worked it over the years.

Maya's fingers trailed along the frame, feeling the intricate patterns etched into the wood. They were a map of sorts, a topography of the loom's history. She followed the patterns, her fingers tracing the curves and lines, until she reached the loom's central axis.

There, a small, hidden compartment had been carved into the wood. It was a tiny, almost imperceptible space, one that seemed to be waiting for her. Maya's heart skipped a beat as she realized that the compartment was slightly ajar, as if someone – or something – had recently passed through it.

She hesitated, her hand hovering above the compartment. The pendant's rhythm seemed to be urging her forward, drawing her into the unknown. Maya's breath caught in her throat as she reached out to push the compartment open.

The sound of the siren's wail grew louder, a crescendo of sound that seemed to be building towards a climax. Maya's heart pounded in her chest, her senses on high alert. She felt a presence behind her, a presence that seemed to be watching her, waiting for her to make a move.

Maya's hand trembled as she pushed the compartment open. A faint scent of sandalwood wafted out, a scent that seemed to be calling to her. She peered into the compartment, her eyes adjusting to the dim light within.

The space was small, barely large enough for a small object to fit. But as Maya's gaze fell upon the object, she realized that it was not an object at all. It was a small, leather-bound book, its cover worn and cracked.

Maya's fingers tightened around the pendant, the wooden disc a comforting weight against her skin. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she recalled the night she'd left it on her nightstand. It was as if the loom had somehow sensed her absence, reached out, and claimed it.

She took a deep breath, letting the scent of cedar and damp earth fill her lungs. The kitchenette seemed to shrink around her, the pendant light casting an eerie glow on the walls. The siren's wail grew louder, a cacophony of sound that threatened to shatter the fragile calm.

Maya's head jerked up, her eyes scanning the darkness. "Ava?" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.

The scratching grew louder, more insistent. Maya's skin prickled with gooseflesh as she turned back to the loom. The pendant light swayed, casting eerie shadows on the walls.

Ava stepped into the kitchenette, her eyes fixed on the loom. "What's going on?" she asked, her voice laced with concern.

Maya hesitated, unsure of how to explain. "I don't know," she said finally. "I think the loom is... calling to me."

Ava's expression was skeptical. "You mean, like, it's trying to get your attention?"

Maya's fingers tightened around the pendant, the wooden disc a comforting weight against her skin. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she recalled the night she'd left it on her nightstand. It was as if the loom had somehow sensed her absence, reached out to claim it.

She took a deep breath, letting the scent of cedar and damp earth fill her lungs. The journal lay open on the floor, its pages fluttering in the draft from the loom. Maya's eyes drifted to the clock on the wall, the metallic clicks echoing through the small space like a countdown.

Outside, the siren wailed again, its piercing wail making her wince. She felt a surge of anxiety, her heart racing in time with the clock's clicks. It was as if the very fabric of time itself was unraveling, leaving her with an aching sense of disconnection.

Maya's gaze returned to the journal, her eyes scanning the page for any sign of her grandmother's handwriting. The words blurred together, a jumbled mess of ink and paper. She felt a pang of frustration, her mind racing with questions. What was her grandmother trying to tell her? Why had she written about the Miller boy's drowning?

As she read on, the words began to take shape, forming a narrative that was both familiar and yet, utterly alien. Maya's eyes widened as she read the line: "The loom is not a tool for creation. It is a mouth, a void that swallows the threads of reality."

A shiver ran down her spine as she realized the truth. The loom wasn't just a simple machine; it was a gateway to another world, a realm where the very fabric of reality was woven and unwoven. Maya felt a thrill of excitement mixed with fear as she read on, the words drawing her deeper into the mystery.

The pendant in her hand began to pulse more rapidly, its rhythm matching the shush-thump from behind the door. Maya's heart skipped a beat as she realized that she wasn't alone. Someone – or something – was waiting for her on the other side of the door.

She took a deep breath, her hand tightening around the pendant. She felt a surge of determination, a sense of purpose that she hadn't felt in years. She was ready to face whatever lay ahead, to unravel the mystery of the loom and the void that it represented.

Maya's eyes snapped back to the journal, but her mind was no longer there. She stood up, her legs unfolding stiffly, and smoothed her jeans. The cold air that had seeped into the room through the window made her skin pimple with gooseflesh. Slowly, she walked across the cramped space to the kitchenette.

Her movements felt hollow, almost like they belonged to someone else. The pendant light above her cast an unflattering glow over the worn linoleum, illuminating the dust bunnies that lurked at its edges. Maya stopped in front of the icebox and ran a hand over its scratched surface. It had been a different life in this tiny apartment, one filled with the warmth of her grandmother's scent – a mixture of sandalwood and fresh laundry – and not the acrid smell of old books and stagnation.

She turned the handle, and the creaking hinges sounded like a lament. The icebox door swung open, revealing a meager interior that held only two six-packs of beer, an old bread loaf that had lost its crust, and a jar of pickled carrots. Maya opened the fridge, which produced a low rumble that was almost contented.

The interior held nothing more than yesterday's leftovers – a congealed pizza and a half-eaten salad. At the very back of the fridge, a piece of paper, tacked with a paperclip, bore an urgent scrawl: DO NOT FORGET JEN'S BIRTHDAY AT 5 PM.

The birthday had probably passed. Maya felt a faint pang of guilt, which quickly gave way to apathy. Who had she even been planning to commemorate this birth of a person she barely knew? Some acquaintance from school? A few distant cousins? The names blurred together in her mind as she scribbled a quick doodle on the note – a cross between a crescent moon and a snake's curve. She folded the paper, slid it back into the fridge, and slammed the door shut.

Outside, the siren had stopped. In its place was an oppressive silence, like a great weight had plummeted onto the world. Maya raised her face, letting the silence wash over her. Time itself felt liquid now, impossible to contain within her palms. It trickled like sand between fingers, whispering the same thing in her ear: whatever was waiting to happen would not wait.

And as she stood there, an unsettling energy rising within the room, the sound of a creaking floorboard underfoot came from the back of the apartment. It was enough to make her heart quicken, a spark within a larger flame.

As she stood up, the pendant still clutched in her hand, Maya felt a sense of resolve wash over her. She would face whatever lay ahead, no matter the cost. The clock on the wall clicked on, marking the passage of time, but Maya felt a sense of timelessness, as if she was standing at the edge of a precipice, staring into the unknown.

She took a step forward, her eyes fixed on the door. The shush-thump grew louder, more insistent, and Maya felt a sense of anticipation building inside her. She raised her hand, hesitating for a moment before reaching out to grasp the doorknob.

The world outside seemed to hold its breath as Maya turned the handle and pushed the door open. A warm, golden light spilled in, illuminating the dark space and casting long shadows across the walls. Maya stepped forward, her eyes adjusting to the light, and what she saw took her breath away.

The room was filled with threads, thousands of them, each one a different color, each one a different texture. They stretched out before her like a pattern, a vast, intricate weave that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. Maya felt a sense of wonder, a sense of awe, as she gazed upon the threads.

And then, she saw it. A figure, standing at the far end of the room, its back to her. Maya felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that she was not alone. The figure was waiting for her, its presence a palpable force that seemed to fill the room.

Maya's heart pounded in her chest as she took a step forward, her eyes fixed on the figure. The threads seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly energy, as if they were alive, as if they were waiting for her to join them.

She took another step forward, her hand still clutching the pendant. The figure didn't move, didn't react, but Maya felt a sense of anticipation building inside her. She was about to take a step into the unknown, to join the threads and become a part of something greater than herself.

As she stood there, frozen in anticipation, the figure slowly turned to face her. Maya's heart skipped a beat as she saw the face, a face that was both familiar and yet, utterly alien. It was her grandmother's face, but it was also something more, something that seemed to hold a secret that only Maya could unlock.

The face smiled, a small, enigmatic smile, and Maya felt a sense of recognition, a sense of understanding. She knew that she was about to start on a journey, a journey that would take her to the very heart of the loom and the void that it represented.

And as she took that first step forward, the threads seemed to come alive, weaving themselves into a pattern of light and shadow, a pattern that would reveal the secrets of the loom and the mysteries of the unknown.

Maya shook her head. "No, it's more than that. It's like... it's trying to tell me something."

Ava's eyes narrowed. "What are you talking about?"

Maya's fingers tightened around the pendant. "I don't know," she admitted. "But I think it's connected to the journal."

Ava's gaze flicked to the journal, her eyes scanning the pages. "What's going on with this journal?" she asked, her voice softer now.

Maya took a deep breath, the words spilling out of her like a confession. "My grandmother used to write in it. She was... a chronicler of drownings."

Ava's expression changed, her eyes widening in surprise. "What do you mean?"

Maya's voice dropped to a whisper. "She wrote about the Miller boy's drowning. And the loom... it's like it's trying to tell me something."

Ava's gaze locked onto the loom, her eyes searching for answers. "I think we need to talk to someone about this," she said finally.

Maya nodded, the pendant still clutched in her hand. "I know," she said. "But I don't know who to trust."

The scratching sound from the loom grew louder, more insistent. Maya felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that she was no longer alone in the kitchenette.

Maya's heart skipped a beat as she reached out to take the book. The leather was cool to the touch, smooth beneath her fingers. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that the book was old, its pages yellowed with age.

As she opened the book, a faint scent of decay wafted out, a scent that seemed to be drawing her in. Maya's eyes scanned the pages, her heart pounding in her chest. The words were written in a handwriting she recognized, a handwriting that seemed to be her own.

The words were a message, a message that seemed to be addressed to her. Maya's breath caught in her throat as she read the words, her heart racing with a mix of fear and excitement.

"I am waiting for you," the message read. "Come to the old quarry at midnight. Come alone."

Maya's eyes snapped up, her gaze meeting the loom's. The pendant's rhythm seemed to be urging her forward, drawing her into the unknown. She felt a presence behind her, a presence that seemed to be watching her, waiting for her to make a move.

Maya's heart pounded in her chest as she realized that she had a choice to make. She could turn back, flee from the loom and its secrets. Or she could take a step forward, into the unknown.

As she stood there, frozen in indecision, the siren's wail grew louder, a crescendo of sound that seemed to be building towards a climax. Maya's heart pounded in her chest, her senses on high alert. She felt a presence behind her, a presence that seemed to be watching her, waiting for her to make a move.

And then, in an instant, everything changed. The siren's wail stopped, the silence that followed was oppressive, heavy with anticipation. Maya's heart pounded in her chest, her senses on high alert.

She took a deep breath, the pendant's rhythm guiding her forward. Maya turned to face the door, her eyes locked on the small, hidden compartment. She felt a presence behind her, a presence that seemed to be watching her, waiting for her to make a move.

And then, in a movement that seemed to be choreographed by the loom itself, Maya reached out and opened the door. The sound of her own heartbeat was the only sound that filled the space, a sound that seemed to be echoing through the very walls themselves.

As she stepped through the doorway, Maya felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. She was leaving the safety of her own world behind, entering a realm that was dark, and unknown, and full of secrets.

But she was not alone. The loom seemed to be watching her, its presence a constant, reassuring presence. Maya's heart pounded in her chest, her senses on high alert.

She took a deep breath, the pendant's rhythm guiding her forward. Maya stepped into the unknown, her heart pounding in her chest, her senses on high alert.

And as she disappeared into the darkness, the loom seemed to whisper a single, haunting word: "Welcome."

Maya hesitated, unsure of how to explain. "I don't know," she said finally. "I think the loom is... calling to me."

Ava's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean?"

Maya's gaze drifted back to the loom, its polished bone frame seeming to pulse with a malevolent energy. "I think it's trying to tell me something," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The scratching stopped, the silence that followed oppressive. Ava's eyes locked onto the loom, her expression a mixture of fascination and fear.

"I think we should get out of here," Ava said finally, her voice firm.

Maya nodded, her fingers still clutching the pendant. She felt a sense of unease, a sense that they were being watched. The siren's wail grew louder, a reminder that they were trapped in this small, cramped space.

As they turned to leave, Maya caught a glimpse of something on the wall, a pattern of threads that seemed to be weaving together. It was the Miller boy's drowning, she was certain of it. And it was just the beginning.

The threads seemed to be pulling her in, drawing her towards the loom. Maya felt a sense of dread wash over her, a sense that she was being pulled into a world of darkness and despair.

She took a deep breath, her eyes locked on the threads. "We need to get out of here," she said, her voice firm.

But as they turned to leave, Maya realized that they were not alone. The presence behind her was watching, waiting. And it was not going to let them leave without a fight.

Driven by desperation, she strode to the box. She would get rid of them. Burn them.

She snatched up the skein of green.

A jolt went through her—a recognition. A cascade of sensory impressions flooded her: the smell of pine needles on Beckford’s trails, the cool creek stones under her childhood feet, the taste of wild raspberries.

It was the essence of her deepest connection to that place. It was her.

And it thrummed like a plucked string, resonating with the distant appetite of the hollow. It was a light.

With a cry, she hurled the skein across the room. It struck the brick wall and fell, innocuous and devastating.

She stood panting. She couldn’t destroy it. It was part of the pact.

Her phone buzzed on the coffee table. She stared at it.

Unknown: Maya. It’s Ben. Got your number from Mrs. Dawes. We need to talk. It’s about the house. About the sounds.

Her thumbs trembled.

Maya: I know. Can you meet? Not at the house. The diner on Main, in an hour?

Ben: Already there. Couldn’t sleep.

The connection died, leaving only the rain’s whisper against the windowpane. For a long moment, Maya simply stared at the dark screen, the ghost of his voice hanging in the air. Then, moving on an instinct deeper than thought, she grabbed her keys and a coat, stepping out into the damp night. The drive was a blur of streaking taillights and her own frantic reflection in the windshield, each mile pulling her closer to the only person who had seen what she had seen. The familiar streets, usually comforting, now felt like a tunnel leading to an unavoidable reckoning. By the time the neon glow of the diner pierced the gloom, her heart was a frantic drum against her ribs, the earlier digital exchange solidifying into a terrifying, physical reality.

The Rainbird Diner was a relic of chrome and neon, its sign sizzling against the wet pavement. Maya pushed through the heavy glass door, the bell jangling a sharp, discordant note above the low hum of conversation and clattering dishes. The warm, greasy air wrapped around her, thick with the smell of coffee and fried food. Her eyes scanned the booths, past a tired-looking waitress and a couple of truckers, before landing on the corner. Ben sat hunched in the last booth, a half-empty mug of black coffee cradled between his hands as if for warmth. He looked exhausted, shadows pooling under his eyes, his face pale under the harsh fluorescent lights. He hadn’t noticed her yet. She took a steadying breath, the door swinging shut behind her, sealing her in. Then his gaze lifted, meeting hers across the checkered floor.

“Maya,” he said. his voice gravelly. “Thanks for coming.”

She slid into the booth. “You said you couldn’t sleep.”

“Neither could you, looks like,” he observed.

After she ordered coffee, Ben leaned forward. “I went back today. In the daylight. With three of my guys and every high-wattage work light I own.”

Maya’s heart thudded. “And?”

“And nothing. The basement is just a basement. No hole. No cold spot.”

The world tilted. “But you saw it.”

“I know what I saw,” he said, jaw tight. “That whispering. It was words, Maya. My guys thought I’d lost it.” He ran a hand through his hair. “But we found my tape measure. Covered in rust. Deep, pitted rust. And it was cold. So cold it burned.”

He held her gaze. “Something is in that house. Something that doesn’t play by the rules. This afternoon, I heard a sound from inside. A rhythmic thump… thump… thump. Like a heavy pendulum. It was coming from upstairs. From your grandmother’s bedroom.”

Maya wrapped her hands around her hot mug. “The loom.”

Ben’s eyes narrowed. “The what?”

The words spilled out. She told him everything—the loom, the journal, the pact, the green thread. She spoke in a low, rapid monotone.

When she finished, they sat in a bubble of shared, awful knowledge.

Ben stared into his coffee. “A tragedy. It wants you to weave a tragedy from your own life.”

“To feed it.”

“And your grandmother refused.”

“Yes.”

“So it’s pushing.” He looked up. “What happens if no one weaves the pattern?”

“It takes everything. The ‘Great Silence.’ Whole families, gone.”

Ben, a man who dealt in concrete and measurable forces, shook his head slowly. “This is impossible.”

“The rust on your tape measure is impossible,” Maya countered softly. “But it happened.”

He acknowledged this with a grim nod. “So what do we do? You can’t be considering giving it what it wants.”

“I don’t know what I’m considering! I don’t know how to weave a pattern! All I know is that sometThe drive back was tense and silent. Maya’s mind was a whirlwind of the loom’s rhythmic clatter, a sound that now seemed to echo from the very core of the house itself, pulling her back with a dreadful gravity. Ben’s truck ate up the miles, the headlights carving a fragile path through the deepening night, each rotation of the tires carrying them closer to the source of the hum. She stared at her own reflection in the dark window, seeing not herself but the empty chair before the heddles, imagining the shuttle moving of its own volition. The twenty-dollar bill on the café table, the abandoned coffee cups—all of that belonged to another world, one that was already receding behind them as the truck turned onto the familiar, tree-lined road that led home.

Ben didn’t hesitate. He threw a twenty on the table. “Let’s go. Now.” The cozy warmth of the diner vanished as they burst into the chill night air, the sense of emergency making the short sprint to his truck feel endless. Gravel spat under the tires as he reversed, and then they were speeding towards the county road, leaving the safe, lit island of the town behind. In the passenger seat, Maya clenched her hands in her lap, her knuckles white. She didn’t speak; the only sound was the rush of wind and the engine’s growl, a stark contrast to the silent, rhythmic threat waiting for them. The familiar landmarks blurred past, each one a marker drawing them inexorably back to the property line, the old oak, and the darkened house where something had been left, provocatively, alone.et, tearing rip, like Velcro pulled slowly apart. It was followed by a soft, moist plop onto the floor.

Ben fumbled for his phone, lighting the screen. “We’re calling someone. Now.”

But Maya wasn’t listening. A creeping warmth was spreading through the pocket of her jacket. Dread, cold and solid, filled her throat. Slowly, she slid her hand inside. Her fingers closed not around her own phone, but around the familiar, carved wooden disc of her grandmother’s pendant. The one she had left, she was certain, on her nightstand fifty miles away. It was hot to the touch, and pulsing with a slow, steady rhythm that perfectly matched the shush-thump from behind the door.

The loom wasn’t just weaving. It was calling. And it had been answered.
