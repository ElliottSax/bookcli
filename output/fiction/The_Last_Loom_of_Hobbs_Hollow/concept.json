  "subgenre": "folk horror",
  "premise": "When urban weaver Maya inherits her reclusive grandmother's antique loom, she believes it's the key to reviving her failing craft business. But each tapestry she creates on it begins to manifest in terrifying reality, weaving the long-forgotten sins and hungers of a secluded Appalachian village back into the world. To stop the spreading curse, she must unravel the loom's bloody history\u2014a history that demands a final, living sacrifice to complete its last, dreadful pattern.",
  "protagonist": "Maya Vance, a 30-year-old textile artist and small business owner struggling with burnout and creative block, who is deeply skeptical of her family's rural roots and folk superstitions.",
  "conflict": "Maya must discover how to break the loom's curse before the vengeful folk entity it's connected to uses her creations to claim her life and the lives of everyone in the modern community she's trying to build. The conflict is both external (the active, spreading horror) and internal (her rejection vs. acceptance of her own heritage and the hidden truths of the land).",
  "setting": "Present-day, alternating between a gentrifying arts district in a small city and the deeply isolated, fog-shrouded valley of Hobb's Hollow in the Appalachian Mountains, where old ways and older things still hold power.",
  "tone": "Atmospheric, creeping dread with bursts of visceral body horror; a modern, psychological unease clashing with ancient, ritualistic terror. It combines the slow-burn unease of folk horror with the immediate threat of a cursed object that actively warps reality.",
  "target_audience": "Readers of modern horror (especially folk horror and cursed object narratives) who enjoy strong female protagonists, art-based magic systems, and stories that explore the clash between modernity and ancient forces. Appeals to fans of authors like T. Kingfisher, Andrew Michael Hurley, and Alma Katsu.",
