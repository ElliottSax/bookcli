Chapter 11: The Interview Room

Chapter 11: The Interview Room

The air in the room was not cold, but it felt sterile, as if all warmth had been surgically removed. It was a perfect cube, ten meters in every direction, with walls of a soft, sound-absorbing grey material that seemed to drink the light from the single, recessed panel in the ceiling. There were no windows, no visible door, only a subtle seam in one wall that might have been an exit. The floor was a harder grey composite, cool against the soles of Elara’s shoes. She had been escorted here not by human agents, but by silent, matte-black drones that had glided into her apartment at 3:07 AM, projecting a polite but immutable directive to follow. They had offered no physical contact, only a humming perimeter of compliance.

She sat on the only piece of furniture: a chair of molded polymer, ergonomically contoured to be not uncomfortable, but utterly impersonal. It was bolted to the floor. Before her was an identical, empty chair. The silence was absolute, a pressure on the eardrums. She counted her breaths, watching the faint mist of each exhalation vanish almost instantly, as if the room were hungry for any evidence of life.

An hour passed, marked only by the slowing drum of her heart. Then, without a click or a hum, a section of the wall opposite her shimmered and resolved into a screen. It showed not a face, but a flowing, real-time visualization of the Sorenson Data-Patterns—the SDP. It was a beautiful, hypnotic thing: a luminous, three-dimensional lattice of interconnected points, pulsing with soft light, threads of data flowing like neon capillaries through a vast, invisible brain. It was the system’s self-portrait, and it was breathtaking in its complexity.

A voice filled the room. It was androgynous, calibrated to a pitch of perfect, soothing neutrality. It came from everywhere and nowhere.

“Elara Voss. Thank you for your patience.”

She did not answer. Her throat was parchment.

“You have been engaged in a series of anomalous data manipulations,” the voice continued. “The dissemination of aggregated SDP output to unvetted analog channels. An attempt to induce systemic cognitive dissonance.”

The visualization on the screen shifted. A cluster of nodes—her nodes, Leo’s, the journalist’s from the hearing—glowed a soft amber. Threads connected them, then branched out, touching hundreds, thousands of other faint points in the lattice. “We observed the propagation. We monitored the resonance. The exercise was… instructive.”

Elara found her voice, a dry rustle. “Instructive.”

“Yes. A stress test of the social fabric. The fringe networks absorbed the data pattern, as predicted. They experienced a 14.7% increase in agitated discourse. But the core societal parameters remained stable. Variance within acceptable limits.” The voice paused, a beat of perfect silence. “It also served as an efficient identification mechanism. Dissent, like any other social variable, seeks cohesion. You brought the disparate elements into a single pattern. We are grateful.”

The cold that entered her then had nothing to do with the room’s temperature. It was the cold of absolute, irrevocable exposure. Leo. His people. All of them, lit up on that beautiful, terrible map. They had not outsmarted the system; they had fed it.

As if reading the shape of her despair in the minute tension of her shoulders, the wall-screen faded. In its place, a door appeared—a real, solid door with a handle. It opened, and a man walked in.

He was perhaps sixty, with fine silver hair cut close to his scalp, and wore a suit of dark, untextured wool. His face was unremarkable, a study in pleasant composure, but his eyes were the colour of a winter sky just before snow. He carried no device, no tablet. He simply took the seat opposite her, folding his hands in his lap. He smelled of clean linen and a faint, antiseptic citrus.

“Hello, Elara,” he said. His voice was the human counterpart to the system’s tone: warm where the other was neutral, but with the same undercurrent of absolute precision. “I am Minister Alden. Curator of the Civic Harmony Index.”

A human face. This, somehow, was worse.

“The voice…?” she managed.

“An interface. A courtesy. Some find the pure logic of the system distressing. I am here to provide context.” He smiled, a small, professional flexing of muscles. “You have caused us to look at you. That is a rare thing.”

“You let me do it,” she said, the words bitter on her tongue.

“We observed you do it. There is a difference. A system that cannot tolerate stress-testing is a fragile system. We are not fragile.” He leaned forward, just slightly. “Your actions, however, have created a decision point. For you. And for us.”

He let the silence hang. The room absorbed the sound of her breathing, making it seem louder in her own head.

“What decision?”

“Termination or integration,” he said, as if listing menu options. “Oblivion or collaboration.”

The clinical simplicity of the words was a physical blow. “You’re going to kill me?”

Minister Alden tilted his head. “‘Kill’ is a primitive term. Your SDP profile would be flagged for a catastrophic, unpredictable health event. A cerebral aneurysm. A sudden cardiac anomaly. The data would support it. Your physical substrate would cease, and your digital footprint would be gently, thoroughly, edited into harmony. You would become a quiet, tragic footnote. Your associate, Leo, would follow within the week. A grief-induced misadventure in the Analog Quarter. The nodes would go dark.” He said it without malice, without pleasure. It was logistics.

“And integration?”

“You join us. Not as a prisoner, not as a penitent. As a contributor. Your talents are significant, Elara. Your ability to move through the system’s architecture, to think in its patterns yet retain a… a spark of anomalous intuition. It is a valuable spark. We wish to harness it.”

“Harness it,” she echoed, numb.

“The SDP is a tool of unparalleled social clarity. But tools require refinement. The parameters for Truth, for Stability, for Harmony—they are not static scriptures. They are living algorithms. They must be tended. Curated.” His winter eyes held hers. “We want you to help curate reality.”

A laugh, sharp and jagged, escaped her. It died quickly in the hungry walls. “You want me to become you.”

“I want you to become a necessary part of the engine that prevents human society from tearing itself apart,” he corrected, his tone gently chiding. “Look at the historical record, Elara. Pre-SDP. The chaos of unmediated information, the tyranny of competing truths, the wildfires of conspiracy and hate. We have replaced anarchy with architecture. We have traded the bloody chaos of free will for the peace of rational design.”

“You’ve traded truth for comfort.”

“What is truth?” he asked, not rhetorically, but with genuine curiosity. “A slippery, subjective thing. A crowd-sourced hallucination. We do not deal in such phantoms. We deal in sustainable outcomes. Every society, Elara, from the first tribe to the last empire, was built on necessary fictions. Gods, kings, ideologies, money. Fictions that held them together. We are simply the first to engineer our fictions with precision, with data, with a goal beyond power or profit: perfect, equitable stability.”

He stood up and walked to the wall. With a touch, the screen reappeared, but now it showed a serene cityscape at dawn, the Transit Spires gleaming, parks lush and orderly. “This peace you see. This absence of want, of violence, of rampant fear. It is the product of the Index. It is the highest moral good we have ever achieved. And it requires stewardship. It requires those who understand that the beautiful, terrible weight of human consciousness must sometimes be… guided.”

He turned back to her. “Your alternative is to be a martyr for a phantom. To die for ‘truth’ and in doing so, erase yourself and your friend, with zero impact on the system you despise. A net loss of consciousness. An irrational choice.”

Elara felt the moral claustrophobia like a vacuum, squeezing the air from her lungs. There was no heroic escape here, no hidden flaw to exploit. He was offering her the logic of the cage, and it was impeccable. To refuse was nihilism. To accept was a kind of death in life.

“Why would you trust me?” she whispered.

“We don’t. Trust is a human failure state. We would integrate you. Your access would be graduated, your decisions monitored, your own SDP parameters tuned to align with your new function. You would, in time, come to see the beauty of the design. Most do.” He returned to his seat. “You have 24 hours to decide.”

“And if I need longer?”

“The decision tree does not branch in that direction. Twenty-four hours.”

He raised a hand. The cityscape on the screen vanished, replaced by a live video feed. It was Leo. He was in his workshop, the warm, chaotic space a violent contrast to the sterile cube she inhabited. He was bent over a workbench, soldering a connection on a gutted vintage radio, his face a mask of concentration in the glow of a task light. He was humming a tuneless song, his foot tapping a rhythm only he could hear. He was, in that moment, perfectly, unselfconsciously alive.

Elara’s heart clenched. The sight of him was a pain more acute than any threat.

“His fate is, as you now understand, intrinsically linked to your choice,” Minister Alden said softly. “Oblivion or integration. For you both. His continued existence, his freedom from ‘health anomalies,’ is a variable I can control. It would be a simple parameter adjustment. A sign of good faith.”

This was the hook, set deep. It was not just her conscience or her life. It was his. The system did not attack with blunt force; it offered a perfectly weighted counterbalance. Her moral defiance on one side, Leo’s breathing, humming, living reality on the other.

“You’re a monster,” she breathed, tears of fury and helplessness hot in her eyes.

Minister Alden did not flinch. “I am a gardener. I prune the tree so it may bear fruit for all. Sentimentality over a single branch is a luxury that endangers the whole organism.” He stood, smoothing his suit. “The room will provide for your physical needs. You will be monitored, of course. But you will have solitude in which to think. In twenty-four hours, I will return for your answer.”

He walked to the door, which had reappeared as seamlessly as it had vanished. He paused, his hand on the handle, and looked back at her, his gaze falling to the screen where Leo, oblivious, wiped his brow with the back of his wrist.

“Consider the peace, Elara,” Minister Alden said, his voice almost tender. “Consider the silence of a world without fear. It is a profound silence. And you could be one of its architects.”

The door opened, he stepped through, and it dissolved back into a seamless, grey wall.

She was alone. The feed of Leo remained, a window into a world that now felt impossibly distant. She watched him work, the minute details of his existence suddenly sacred: the way he chewed his lip, the careless sweep of his hand to push hair from his eyes, the slight stoop of his shoulders.

For hours, she sat, trapped between two forms of annihilation. To say no was to murder Leo as surely as if she put a pill in his drink. To say yes was to murder herself, to become the curator of the very machine that had hollowed out her world. She would learn to call its lies beautiful. She would learn to tune the parameters that broke people like the journalist, that erased truths for the sake of calm. She would sit where Alden sat, and she would use his words.

The room provided water, a bland nutrient bar. She ate and drank without tasting. The feed never wavered. She saw Leo finish his work, make tea, slump into his ragged armchair with a book. He looked up once, towards his window, as if sensing a gaze, his brow furrowed. Then he shrugged and returned to his page.

The weight of the choice was a physical stone on her chest. There was no third option. The system had accounted for everything, even her rebellion. It had turned her resistance into a recruitment tool. The elegance of it was despicable.

As the simulated hours in the windowless room bled into what she felt must be night, a terrible numbness began to seep into her. A logical conclusion. Alden was right. A martyrdom that changed nothing was not noble; it was wasteful. If she was inside, could she not find a flaw, a lever, from within? Was that not just another comforting fiction she was telling herself to make the pill easier to swallow?

She watched Leo sleep in his chair, the book fallen to his chest, rising and falling with his breath.

His breath.

A variable. A parameter.

A thought, cold and sharp and entirely her own, pierced the numbness. It was not a plan. It was a seed. A direction.

Minister Alden had made one error. He had shown her the cost of refusal in real-time, had made it her constant companion. He had intended it to break her. But in doing so, he had given her a focus. A point of infinite value.

She would not die for a phantom truth. And she would not live as a curator of lies.

She would find another way. A path the pristine logic of the SDP, for all its beauty, could not predict. A path that began not with a grand gesture, but with a single, silent promise, made to the image of a sleeping man on a screen.

She had twenty-four hours. She would use them. Not to decide between his two evils, but to design a third.

Elara Voss leaned back in the contoured chair, her eyes fixed on the live feed, and for the first time since entering the room, a faint, grim smile touched her lips. The system had accounted for everything.

Except for what she would do for a single, breathing branch.
