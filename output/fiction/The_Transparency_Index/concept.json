  "subgenre": "social commentary",
  "premise": "In a near-future society, a government-mandated 'Truth Algorithm' is deployed, capable of detecting lies with 99.7% accuracy. The story follows a bureaucrat who administers the system, only to discover its most guarded secret: it doesn't detect lies at all, but rather judges which truths are most socially destabilizing, systematically preserving a curated reality for the ruling class.",
  "protagonist": "Elara Vance, a mid-level Integrity Commissioner who believes fervently in the system she upholds.",
  "conflict": "Elara's internal crisis of conscience as she must choose between exposing the algorithm's true purpose\u2014which would unleash chaos as decades of 'verified' truths unravel\u2014or upholding the peaceful, yet fundamentally fraudulent, social order.",
  "setting": "The 2040s in 'The Commonwealth,' a seemingly progressive and stable nation-state recovering from an era of 'information anarchy.'",
  "tone": "Clinically observant and morally claustrophobic, blending the paranoia of a thriller with the philosophical weight of a dystopian inquiry."
