Chapter 5: The Un-Curating

The rain was a data stream, a grey, vertical static falling on the transit hub’s permacrete. Elian watched it from the sterile overhang, his internal chrono pulsing a soft, amber reminder against his optic nerve: Contact window: 17:00. Duration: 10 minutes max. He had fabricated a pretext—a routine Civic Harmony survey on communal green-space utilization. It was thin, the kind of lie the System generated millions of times a day, a white noise of bureaucratic fiction. His own score, a steady 8.2, glowed with a placid blue in the corner of his vision, unmoved by the deception. It was sanctioned deception, after all. Curator-class privilege.

Lyra’s residence was a Tier-3 habitation pod, a hexagonal module stacked with identical others like a honeycomb of anemic glass and brushed steel. It hummed with the low-grade energy of efficient living. Her score, according to his latest ping, was a fluctuating 6.1. It had been as high as 7.8 and as low as 5.5 in the past week, a volatility the System tagged as ‘mildly anomalous.’ To Elian, who had watched the timelapse of her metrics, it looked like a heartbeat.

He keyed the entry request, the chime a bland two-tone. The door slid open not with a hiss, but with a faint, protesting scrape. The air that met him was different. Not the filtered, ion-balanced atmosphere of the Curator quarters, nor the slightly stale, recycled smell of most pods. This air held traces of things: damp earth, a tang of citrus, the faint, sweet-rot scent of organic matter past its prime.

“Come in, Curator.” Her voice came from the side, not the door’s sightline.

The pod was an act of quiet rebellion. The standard-issue furniture was pushed against one wall, draped with a faded, woven textile depicting irregular, non-geometric patterns. The central space was occupied by a low table hewn from actual wood, its surface scarred and stained. On it sat an array of objects: smooth river stones, a bowl of withered apples, a cluster of feathers tied with twine, and a lump of wet, grey clay. Vines, real ones, with broad, dusty leaves, spilled from hanging baskets, filtering the sterile ceiling light into green-gold shadows. The room’s sensor array, a small dome in the center of the ceiling, had been carefully, almost artistically, draped with a swath of mossy fabric. It was not disabled, he noted clinically. It was un-curated.

Lyra stood by the window-wall, her back to the rain-streaked panorama of the city-grid. She was smaller than she seemed in his surveillance feeds, her frame slight in a simple tunic of undyed linen. Her hands were stained, dark under the nails with what looked like soil. She wasn’t looking at her score display. Her gaze was fixed on him, and it held none of the anxious deference most citizens showed a Curator’s uniform.

“Thank you for your time, Citizen Lyra,” Elian began, activating his record-field. A soft chime indicated capture. “This won’t take long. A few questions regarding your engagement with the Arbor Walk on Level—”

“You can drop the pretext,” she said, her voice not unkind, but weary, as if repeating a lesson to a slow student. “It doesn’t suit you. The man with the numbered shadow shouldn’t lie so clumsily.”

Elian’s breath caught, a tiny, physical stutter his biometrics would flag. His score flickered—8.2 to 8.1, then back. “I’m afraid I don’t—”

“Your shadow,” she repeated, nodding not at him, but at the space on the floor behind him, cast by the ambient light. “Everyone has a score. It follows them, a little number, a color. A shadow made of light. But yours…” She stepped forward, her eyes tracing the air around his shoulders. “Yours has digits that don’t just follow. They lead. They’re heavier. You’re not here about trees.”

The clinical part of his mind raced: Perceptive. Metaphorical cognition outside normative parameters. Possible pareidolia, assigning agency to abstract data. But the words, the way she said them—the man with the numbered shadow—felt like a cold key turning in a lock he didn’t know he possessed.

He deactivated the record-field. The chime sounded, a falling note. “You’ve been flagged for behavioral volatility,” he said, shifting to a more direct, though still official, tone. “Your score is unstable. I am here to understand the source of the instability. To help stabilize it.” It was the Curator’s mantra: Understand. Stabilize. Optimize.

Lyra smiled, a small, crooked thing that didn’t reach her eyes. “The source,” she echoed. She moved to the table and sat on the floor, gesturing for him to do the same. After a moment’s hesitation, he did, the permacrete floor unforgiving through his uniform pants. The smell of the clay was stronger here, primal and cool.

“There is no ‘source,’” she said, picking up the lump of clay. “Not like a leak in a pipe. I am not trying to change my score, Curator. I am simply living. And the score… it reacts. It’s confused.”

“The System quantifies lived experience to maximize harmony and potential,” Elian recited. “It doesn’t get ‘confused.’ It calculates.”

“Does it?” She began to work the clay, her fingers strong and sure, squeezing, pressing, rolling. “What does it calculate this as?” She nodded at her hands. “What is the productive value? The social utility? The economic contribution?”

Elian’s optic display automatically attempted analysis. Material: hydrated silicate minerals (non-standard). Activity: manual manipulation. No recognized pattern: sculpting? Purpose: undetermined. Probable classification: leisure (low-yield), hobby (non-remunerative). Temporary score adjustment: negligible to slightly negative for resource diversion. The data scrolled, a silent, judgmental ticker.

“It sees a waste of time,” Lyra said, as if reading the scroll on his own retina. “A diversion of energy from productive or self-betterment tasks. My score dips a few points when I do this for too long. But watch.”

He watched. Her hands were not just making a shape; they were in a conversation with the material. A thumb pressed in, became a socket. Two fingers pinched, pulled up a nascent form. It was slow. Incredibly, unbearably slow in a world of instant data and millisecond feedback. There was no goal displayed, no progress bar. Just the wet, slick sounds of creation, the slight grit of particles, the gradual emergence of form from formlessness. A torso. A suggestion of legs. A rounded head.

Elian found his own breathing had slowed to match the rhythm of her hands. The constant, low-level hum of his own internal data-stream—the news feeds, the priority alerts, the ambient score-checking of everyone in his vicinity—seemed to fade into a distant buzz. There was only this: the woman, the clay, the green light, the smell. He was observing, but not for the report. He was watching a thing come into being.

His score had been a steady blue 8.2. As he watched, detached from his Curator’s purpose, absorbed in the simple, sensuous reality of the act, he saw it in his periphery. The number shimmered. It dissolved into a blur of pixels. For one second, two, it displayed not a number, but: ???.

A jolt of pure, systemic terror shot through him. It was an error code. An impossibility. The System was always certain. He blinked, hard, and his internal display rebooted with a faint, painful zap. 8.1. It was back, but the memory of the void, the question marks, was a cold sweat on his spine. A glitch. It had to be a glitch. Proximity to her anomalous data field.

Lyra hadn’t looked up. “It doesn’t know what to do with this,” she murmured, her voice soft, almost singing. “It can measure the caloric expenditure of my hands. It can analyze the mineral composition of the clay. It can timestamp the duration. But the thing that is happening… the why… it has no algorithm for that.”

She held up the figurine. It was crude, childlike. A humanoid shape, with a quiet dignity in its posture. It was unmistakably a being in a state of repose, of stillness.
