ed perfection. But then, a ripple. A distortion. A single, glaring red point, pulsing like a wound in the fabric of the system.
Lyra.
Elian's breath caught. He had seen her score before, but never like this. Never in the raw, unfiltered context of the city's neural network. It was a violation, a brutal exposure of her essence to the cold, calculating gaze of the system.
“She is unstable,” Vance said, his voice devoid of emotion. “A critical failure. The system has attempted to correct her, but she resists. We must stabilize her, or she will destabilize the entire network.”

Elian's hands clenched into fists. “You can't just—”

“This is not a negotiation,” Vance interrupted, his tone sharp. “This is a fact. The system is designed to maintain equilibrium. Lyra is a disruption. She must be corrected.”

The hologram shifted, zooming in on Lyra's score. It was a chaotic mess of conflicting data, a storm of red and black that appeared to defy the very laws of order. Elian could see the system's attempts to stabilize her—pulses of gold, like tendrils reaching out to pull her back into line. But each time, she resisted, her score flaring brighter, more defiant.
“She's not a machine,” Elian said, his voice trembling. “You can't just—”

“She is a variable,” Vance replied, his voice cold. “A variable that must be controlled. The system is designed to maintain equilibrium. Lyra is a disruption. She must be corrected.”

Elian's mind raced. He had to do something. He had to save her. But what? The system was too vast, too powerful. He was simply one man, one insignificant point in the vast network of the city.
Then, he remembered the mark. The ‘0’. The Un-Scored network. It was a language of leaks, of worn gears, of intentional inefficiencies. It was a language of resistance.
He took a deep breath, steeling himself. “You're wrong,” he said, his voice steady. “The system isn't perfect. It has flaws. It has gaps. And those gaps are where the truth lies.”

Vance's eyes narrowed. “What are you talking about?”

Elian smiled, a small, defiant smile. “I'm talking about that the system isn't as infallible as you think. It's a machine, and machines can be broken. And I'm going to break it.”

Vance's expression darkened. “You are delusional. The system is—”

“It's not a god,” Elian interrupted. “It's a tool. And tools can be used. Or misused. And I'm going to misuse it.”

Vance's lips thinned. “You are a fool. You cannot—”

“Watch me,” Eli answered, his voice low, dangerous.
And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving Vance standing there, his expression a mask of cold fury. He had no plan, no idea of what he was going to do. But he knew one thing: he was not going to let them take Lyra. Not without a fight.
The corridors of the Stabilization Annex were a labyrinth of sterile white, the air thick with the hum of machinery and the faint, antiseptic scent of disinfectant. Elian moved quickly, his heart pounding in his chest. He had no idea where he was going, but he knew he had to find Lyra. He had to save her.
As he turned a corner, he heard voices. Two Custodians, their mechanical voices a low, rhythmic drone. He ducked behind a maintenance panel, his breath coming in short, sharp gasps. The Custodians passed by, their footsteps echoing in the empty corridor. He waited until they were gone, then continued on his way.
He found her in a small, windowless room, her body strapped to a chair, her head encased in a metal helmet. The helmet was connected to a series of wires, which in turn were connected to a large, humming machine. The machine was a monstrosity of metal and wire, its surface a chaotic mess of blinking lights and flickering screens.
Lyra's eyes were closed, her face a mask of pain. Her score, displayed on a screen above her, was a chaotic mess of red and black, a storm of data thato defy the very laws of order.
He took a deep breath, steeling himself. He had to find a way to disrupt the system. To break it. To save Lyra.
He approached the machine, his hands trembling. He had no idea what he was doing, but he knew he had to try. He reached out, his fingers brushing against the cold metal of the machine. The surface was smooth, seamless, a perfect example of the city's relentless efficiency.
But then, he it. A slight imperfection. A tiny, almost imperceptible bump. He traced it with his fingers, his heart pounding. It was a seam. A weak point. A flaw.
He smiled, a tiny, defiant smile. The system was not perfect. It had flaws. And those flaws were where the truth lay.
He reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, jagged piece of metal. It was a shard from the tray he had been given in the detention cell, a remnant of the city's relentless efficiency. He pressed it against the seam, his hands trembling. He had no idea what he was doing, but he knew he had to try.
He pushed.
The machine shuddered, a low, ominous hum filling the room. The lights flickered, the screens flashing a chaotic mess of data. The helmet on Lyra's head sparked, a shower of sparks erupting from the wires. She gasped, her eyes flying open, a look of pure terror on her face.
“Elian!” she cried, her voice a raw, desperate plea.
He reached for her, his hands trembling. “Lyra! I'm here! I'm going to save you!”

The machine shuddered again, a loud, ominous crack echoing through the room. The wires connecting the helmet to the machine sparked, a shower of sparks erupting from the wires. The helmet flew off, clattering to the floor. Lyra gasped, her hands flying to her head, a look of pure relief on her face.
He smiled, a slittle defiant smile. “I told you I would.”
