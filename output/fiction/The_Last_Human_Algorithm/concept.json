  "title": "The Last Human Algorithm",
  "genre": "literary",
  "subgenre": "social commentary",
  "premise": "In a world where a person's entire social and economic value is determined by a single, government-mandated 'Adaptability Score,' a terminally rigid archivist is assigned to audit the system. His quest to prove its infallibility forces him to document the life of a woman whose score is mysteriously, dangerously fluid, transforming in real-time based on her authentic, un-curated experiences. As he tries to pin her down, her very existence becomes a living critique of the quantified self, forcing him to choose between upholding the system that defines him or embracing the chaotic, un-scoreable humanity he is tasked with erasing.",
  "protagonist": "Leo Vance, a mid-level bureaucrat and archivist for the Bureau of Social Cohesion, whose own high but static Adaptability Score is his source of pride and identity.",
  "conflict": "Leo's fundamental belief in a measurable, orderly world clashes with the irreducible complexity of a human life that refuses to be categorized, creating a crisis of conscience that threatens his career, his social standing, and his understanding of what it means to be a person.",
  "setting": "A near-future metropolis where every interaction, purchase, and relationship is tracked and fed into the central 'Adaptability Index,' determining housing, employment, and social permissions.",
  "tone": "Clinically observant and quietly dystopian, evolving into one of urgent, poetic humanity; a mood of measured despair slowly cracking open to reveal fragile hope."
