Chapter 2: Subject #7: Lyra

The observation began, like everything for Elian Kael, with a sterile protocol. Subject #7, called “Lyra” in the files, was a thirty-four-year-old infrastructure maintenance coordinator for the Eastern Grid. Her profile was a study in unremarkable stability: nine years in her role, a residential cubicle in Sector 9-D, no registered partnerships or children, a consumption index right at the acceptable median. Her Adaptability Score, until seven days ago, had been a flat, reassuring line at 7.8. Then, it began to breathe.

Elian’s workspace was a capsule of silent light. The central holoscreen cast a pale blue wash over his hands, the only sound the low hum of the building’s circulatory system. Lyra’s life unfolded in a triptych of feeds: the mandatory optic-log from her own corneal implant (a grainy, first-person stream of ceilings, walkways, and machinery), the public sensor data from her sector (overhead shots of anonymous crowds, thermal blobs moving through geometric streets), and the biometric stream—heart rate, cortisol levels, neural activity—all boiled down to the fluctuating number that defined her. The Score.

Her morning was a liturgy of efficiency. 06:00: Wakefulness registered. The optic-log showed the smooth, grey polymer ceiling of her cubicle. 06:15: Consumption of a nutrient wafer, the biometrics noting optimal glycemic absorption. 07:00: Entry into the Eastern Grid transit pod, the public sensor capturing a woman of average height, hair the colour of weathered ash, her posture a study in contained motion. She took the same seat, folded her hands in the same way. Elian watched, his own focus absolute, the data streams merging into a coherent, boring story. His own score, displayed in the corner of his vision, held steady at 9.3.

The first anomaly happened at 08:17. Lyra’s transit pod had emptied its passengers at the Grid hub. Her path, a green line on the municipal overlay, was direct. But her optic-log swivelled. An elderly man, his musculoskeletal implant glitching, sending a jerky tremor through his right leg, had dropped a data-slate. Packages teetered in his arms. The crowd, a river of scored individuals, parted around him, a study in fluid dynamics. Lyra’s feed paused. The biometrics showed a minor spike in heart rate, a flicker in the prefrontal cortex linked to empathic processing. Then, she broke her path.

“Your stabilizer,” her voice, filtered through the implant’s audio, was low, slightly rough with morning. “It’s misfiring. The tertiary actuator.”

The man blinked, confused. She didn’t touch him, but knelt, retrieved the slate, and rearranged his packages, creating a stable stack in his arms. The action took one minute and forty-seven seconds. It broke three efficiency metrics for punctual arrival and unsanctioned interpersonal intervention. As she straightened, her own Score, which had been sitting at a solid 7.9, dipped.
