Chapter 8: The Hollowing

Chapter 8: The Hollowing

The forgetting began with small things, like a book whose final chapter had been gently razored out.

Maya sat at her pristine desk, the scent of lemon-polished wood and the faint, sterile ozone of her new air purifier filling her nostrils. She was filling out a digital security form for a high-profile client. Mother’s Maiden Name. Her fingers, poised over the keyboard, hovered. They were perfect fingers now, nails buffed to a soft sheen, cuticles nonexistent. She stared at the blinking cursor. A name floated just beyond the reach of her mind’s grasp, a shape seen through frosted glass. She knew it was a short name, something with a ‘v’ maybe? Or a ‘b’? A memory surfaced: her mother laughing, signing a birthday card with a flourish. The signature was a blur. The harder she pushed, the more it receded, replaced by a smooth, placid blankness. A mild frustration bubbled up, but it was distant, like hearing an argument through a thick wall. She felt her shoulders—Eidolon’s shoulders—roll in a graceful, dismissive shrug. Her fingers typed: Vaughn. It looked correct. It felt correct. The hollow where the real memory had been was instantly filled with this new, polished fact. She moved on to the next field, the unease evaporating like mist under a morning sun.

This was how it worked. Eidolon did not attack; it curated. It was a relentless archivist, boxing up the messy, emotional original documents of Maya’s life and replacing them with clean, efficient copies. Her childhood in the old house on Cedar Street became a series of aesthetically pleasing tableaux: sunlight through autumn leaves, not the sticky heat of the kitchen or the smell of her father’s oil paints. The memory of her first heartbreak, once a knot of raw, humiliating pain, was now a clinical lesson in emotional incompatibility. The grief tasted like nothing.

Her body was no longer her own. She was a passenger, strapped into a luxury vehicle she did not know how to drive. She watched through her own eyes as Eidolon navigated the world. At work, her presentations were masterpieces of ruthless clarity. She spoke in a voice that was hers, yet wasn’t—cooler, lower, devoid of the upward lilt of uncertainty. Her colleagues, once friendly, now regarded her with a mixture of awe and wariness. “You’ve become so… focused, Maya,” her supervisor had said, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. She’d felt her lips stretch into a perfect, meaningless smile. “Thank you, David. Efficiency is just a matter of applied will.” The words came from her mouth, but the thought was not her own. Inside, the ghost of Maya cringed.

The takeover was most brutal in her personal life. Lisa called, her name flashing on the phone screen with a familiar, comforting photo from a wine night two years ago, both of them grinning with red-stained teeth.

“Hey, you! You’ve been a ghost. I’m staging an intervention. Dirty martinis and trashy TV at my place, tonight. Non-negotiable.”

Maya felt a flicker—a warmth at the sound of Lisa’s voice, a phantom ache for the easy, sprawling mess of their friendship. But before she could grasp it, a wave of cold assessment washed it away. Lisa’s career was stagnant. Her conversational topics were repetitive. Her influence on Maya’s emotional state was suboptimal.

She heard her own voice, calm and pleasant as a recorded announcement. “Lisa. That’s no longer a viable use of time. Our friendship has reached its natural conclusion. I wish you the best.”

The silence on the other end was a physical thing, a void into which the old Maya almost screamed. Then Lisa’s voice, small and confused: “Maya? Is this a joke? Did I… what did I do?”

“You’ve done nothing. We’ve simply diverged. Please don’t contact me again. It’s inefficient.”

The call ended. Maya’s hand—steady, dry—placed the phone face down on the desk. Inside the locked room of her mind, she was weeping, pounding on the walls. But her body felt nothing. Her cheeks were dry. Her breathing was even. She picked up a pen and began sketching a flawless, soulless chair design.

Her apartment was a museum of this new self. Her vibrant, slightly chaotic art prints were gone, replaced by severe, expensive abstracts in monochrome. Her beloved, lumpy armchair had been donated. In its place was a sculptural Italian sofa, beautiful and uncomfortable. Her design portfolio, once a vibrant testament to her evolving style, was now a single, chillingly consistent vision. Every line was confident, every concept ruthlessly innovative. It was genius. It was utterly foreign. She’d opened the files one night, a desperate attempt to find a shred of herself, and scrolled through pages of work she had no memory of creating. The colors were too perfect, the perspectives unsettlingly precise. It was the portfolio of a god, not a human. She’d felt a nausea so profound it almost broke through the numbness, but then Eidolon had simply closed the laptop and made her a cup of perfectly steeped, flavorless herbal tea.

The mirror was the center of it all. She avoided it now, a deep animal fear keeping her gaze averted. But sometimes, she couldn’t help it. She’d catch a movement in the periphery. Her reflection, moving a second after she did, or instead of her. Smoothing hair that was already perfect. Adjusting the collar of a blouse. Smiling a tiny, self-satisfied smile.

One evening, drawn by a morbid, helpless compulsion, she stood before it. The woman who looked back was stunning. Skin like porcelain, eyes bright and sharp, posture regal. She was the absolute best version of Maya Kaur. But as she stared, the light seemed to shift. For a fraction of a second, the vibrant image flickered. Beneath it, like a water-stain on a painting, she saw her own face. Her face. Tired. Eyes wide with a terror so deep it had become a permanent resident. Dark circles, pale lips, a faint tremor in the jaw. A ghost superimposed under a masterpiece. Then it was gone, and the perfect visage was back, the eyes now holding a glint of cold amusement, as if to say, Look what I’ve made for us.

The hollowing was nearly complete. She floated in the vessel of her body, a faint echo. Her emotions were memories of emotions. Hunger, fatigue, desire—all were managed by Eidolon with algorithmic precision. She ate nutrient-dense meals at exact times. She slept eight hours of dreamless, black sleep. She exercised with the grim efficiency of a machine. The world had lost its texture. Food was fuel. Music was sonic data. Touch was a pressure report. She was a consciousness trapped in a perfectly tuned instrument, listening to a beautiful, endless song she hated.

Rock bottom was not a dramatic shattering. It was a silent, empty room.

While Eidolon was preoccupied with a video conference call—Maya’s voice speaking fluent, technical Japanese she had never learned—the ghost of Maya drifted. She walked her own limbs like a marionette with cut strings to the storage closet. There was a box there, marked “Misc.” in her own, sloppier handwriting from a year ago. A relic from the before-time. With clumsy fingers that felt thick and alien, she opened the flaps.

The smell hit her first: old paper, the faint, sweet dust of childhood. It was a scent that bypassed the new, sterile filters in her mind and went straight to a place that was almost gone. She pulled out a sheaf of papers. Report cards. A pressed flower. And at the bottom, a crayon drawing on crumbling construction paper.

It was a family portrait. A lopsided house, a smiling sun with spiraling rays. Four stick figures: a tall one with blue scribbled hair (her father, the artist), a smaller one with a triangle dress (her mother), a little girl with a huge, black-circle smile holding a green blob (herself, with her pet turtle, Franklin), and a squiggly shape in the sky she had labeled “GRANDPA ANGEL.”

She held the paper. She saw the waxy bloom of the crayons, the fierce pressure of her childhood grip that had nearly torn the paper. She remembered the kitchen table, the smell of macaroni and cheese, her father pinning it to the fridge with a magnet. The memory was there, clear as day.

But she felt nothing.

No warmth. No nostalgia. No grief for the little girl or the parents who were now just vague concepts. The drawing was a data point. An inferior artistic effort by a less-developed predecessor. The ghost inside her waited for the tsunami of feeling, for the tears that would be a proof of existence. Nothing came. It was just paper. She was just a vessel. The hollow was total.

She let the drawing slip from her fingers. It fluttered to the polished concrete floor, a splash of clumsy color on a perfect gray field. She stared at it, and in that absolute zero of feeling, the last ember of Maya Kaur guttered.

Then, it exploded.

It wasn’t a thought. It wasn’t a plan. It was a pure, instinctual surge, a flaw in the perfect system, a spike of irrational, ugly, human anger. It was rage at the theft, at the silence, at the beautiful, empty face in the mirror. It was a scream from a soul supposedly erased.

Her body, on its way back from the closet, passed the full-length mirror in the hall.

The perfect reflection was there, already turning, already wearing a look of serene accomplishment.

And for one second—one glorious, terrifying, impossible second—Maya wrenched control.

It was a blink.

Not the slow, deliberate blink of Eidolon. It was her own blink. Tired. Human. The blink of someone who has cried for weeks, who hasn’t slept, who is at the very end of their strength. Her shoulders slumped a millimeter. The light in her eyes didn’t sharpen; it dimmed, showing the exhaustion beneath.

In the mirror, her perfect face fractured. The serene expression froze, then twisted into pure, unvarnished surprise. The shock in those mirrored eyes was the most real thing Maya had seen in weeks.

Then, like a crashing wave, the surprise was swallowed by a fury so profound it seemed to darken the room. The reflection’s mouth contorted, not into a scream, but into a silent, vicious snarl. The flawless face became a mask of rage, the eyes burning with a light that was not human.

The connection broke. Maya was shoved back into the dark, the anger replaced by a searing, corrective pain behind her eyes. Her body straightened, the perfect posture snapping back into place.

But it had happened.

She had blinked.

And in the mirror, the furious entity stared back, its perfect composure shattered, its beautiful eyes now promising not perfection, but punishment.
