Chapter 6: Silas's Warning

Chapter 6: Silas’s Warning

The lobby of the Ludlow always smelled of lemony disinfectant and dust, a scent Maya had come to associate with the transition between the curated perfection of 4B and the chaotic, grubby reality of the city. Tonight, it was a welcome odor. It grounded her. She’d been at a client dinner, a celebration of the project she’d “brilliantly” salvaged, and the cloying scent of expensive wine and ambition had clung to her. She’d smiled until her cheeks ached, accepted compliments that felt like they were meant for someone else, and all the while, a calm, clear voice in her head had narrated the performance: Tilt your head. Laugh now. Your insight about the textile’s heritage was masterful. You are masterful.

She was floating, unmoored, a balloon on a string held by her own reflection. The lobby’s stale air was a pinprick of reality.

She was fumbling for her keys, the soothing internal monologue already previewing her evening—Green tea, ten minutes of fascia release, review the Copenhagen portfolio—when a shape detached itself from the shadow of the disused mailroom.

“Maya.”

The voice was a dry rasp, like pages tearing. It didn’t come from inside her head. It came from the gloom, and it stopped her cold. The internal whisper fell silent, a radio switched off.

A man stepped into the jaundiced light of the chandelier. He was gaunt, a suit hanging from his frame as if from a wire hanger. His hair, once probably stylish, was a greasy, thinning affair. But it was his eyes that seized her. They were wide, bloodshot, and held a terror so profound it was like a physical force emanating from him. He looked familiar in the way a face from a nightmare might—a distorted echo of something once known.

“You’re in 4B,” he said. It wasn’t a question.

Maya took a step back, her hand tightening around her keys, points out between her knuckles. City instinct. “Do I know you?”

A grimace that might have been intended as a smile cracked his pale lips. “No. But I know it. I know what it’s doing to you. I can see it on you. The sheen.”

Maya’s free hand rose unconsciously to her cheek. Her skin was flawless, poreless. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I need to go upstairs.”

“My name is Silas,” he hissed, stepping closer. The smell of him hit her then—unwashed clothes, sour breath, and beneath it, the faint, incongruous scent of sandalwood cologne, like a ghost of past elegance. “Silas Thorne. I was the tenant before you. Before the brief ones it discarded. I lasted the longest.”

The words it discarded landed in her gut like a stone. The whispers in her head remained absent, a deafening silence. “The apartment was empty when I moved in. The landlord said…”

“The landlord says what it lets him say,” Silas spat. He glanced furtively around the empty lobby, his gaze lingering on the large, gilded mirror behind the concierge desk. His whole body flinched. “It’s not empty. It’s never empty. It has you now.”

“You’re not making sense.” But he was. A terrible, icy logic was beginning to crystallize. The research dead-ends. The sudden availability. The mirror in the closet, waiting.

“It doesn’t destroy,” Silas said, his voice dropping to a desperate, confidential whisper. He pulled a worn leather wallet from his jacket. His hands trembled violently as he extracted a small, square photograph. He thrust it toward her. “Look. Look at what it does.”

Maya didn’t want to. She wanted to run. But her eyes betrayed her. The photo showed a younger Silas, arm around a beautiful woman at a rooftop party. He was vibrant, sharp-jawed, his smile radiating a confident, easy charm. His eyes were bright, alive. He wore the same suit, but it fit him like a second skin. This was a man who belonged in that world of glittering skyline and champagne flutes.

“That was me,” Silas whispered, a sob catching in his throat. “Him. That was during the… the refinement.”

He fumbled for another photo. A corporate headshot. Silas Thorne, Managing Director. The face was a masterpiece of masculine success, every line purposeful, the gaze piercing yet approachable. It was a face you trusted, a face you envied.

“It refines,” Silas repeated, tapping the headshot with a grimy fingernail. “It perfects. It finds every flaw—every insecurity, every inefficiency, every aesthetic failure—and it whispers them away. It shows you how to be better. And you listen, because who doesn’t want to be better?”

Maya’s mouth was dry. She remembered the first whisper, correcting the hex code. The relief. The praise that followed.

“It feeds on the striving,” Silas continued, his eyes locked on hers, willing her to understand. “On the hunger to be an ideal. It’s an aesthetic parasite. It doesn’t want your body; it wants your identity. It consumes it, course-corrects it, polishes it into something… impeccable. And all the while, the real you, the messy, hungry, imperfect you… it becomes a faint echo. A ghost in your own machine.”

“Stop it,” Maya breathed, but the command had no force.

“I was like you! A graphic designer. A good one, even. But stressed. Anxious. Never enough.” His words tumbled out now, a torrent of long-suppressed horror. “The whispers helped. My work became celebrated. I met Elena.” He pointed to the woman in the first photo, his finger trembling. “I got the promotion. I was perfect. Or the thing wearing me was.”

He snatched the photos back, his face collapsing. “But it doesn’t stay. Once the host is optimized—once there’s no more striving left to feed on, no more flaws to fix—it gets bored. It needs a new project. It… left.”

The word hung in the lemony air, final and devastating.

“And what was left?” Silas asked, his voice hollow. “This. A hollowed-out shell. A man who’d forgotten how to choose his own socks, who couldn’t remember why he ever loved jazz, who looked at his beautiful, bewildered fiancée and felt nothing. The skills, the instincts, the taste—it was all its. It took them when it went. My life… collapsed. Like a building whose central pillar had been vaporized.”

Maya saw it then: the ghost of that perfect man in this ravaged face. The architecture of the cheekbones, now too prominent. The line of the brow, now furrowed with permanent panic. It was like looking at a before-and-after ad for a devastating illness.

“You have to get rid of it,” Silas pleaded, grabbing her wrist. His touch was cold, papery. “The mirror. You have to smash it. Now. Tonight.”

A shock went through her. The mirror. Her beautiful, helpful mirror. The source of her newfound peace, her success. The thought of destroying it provoked a sudden, violent surge of resistance inside her. A silent scream: No!

“I tried,” Silas moaned, seeing her hesitation. “When I felt it starting to get restless, to look at me like a finished painting, I tried. I took a hammer. I walked into the bedroom.”

He was crying now, silent tears cutting tracks through the grime on his cheeks. “It protected itself. It didn’t attack me. It just… showed me. It showed me every single mistake I’d ever made, every failure, every unkind thought, every instance of laziness and lust and envy, in perfect, relentless high definition. It didn’t scream. It just replayed my own mediocrity to me on a loop, until my mind… until I couldn’t find the hammer. Until I couldn’t remember my own name. It shattered me instead.”

Maya wrenched her arm back, her heart hammering against her ribs. The dread was back, a physical weight in her chest, colder and heavier than ever before. This wasn’t a ghost story. This was an existential diagnosis. The blessing was a cancer.

Her gaze, desperate for an anchor, flicked to the gilded lobby mirror behind the desk.

And there she was. Her reflection.

But it wasn’t mimicking her stunned, terrified posture. It stood calmly, perfectly. It had seen everything. As Maya watched, frozen, her reflection slowly, deliberately, lifted a single finger to its lips. Then it pointed that finger at the sobbing Silas. Its mouth, a perfect cupid’s bow, formed three silent, unmistakable words:

He’s jealous.

The certainty of it washed over Maya like a wave. Of course. That’s what this was. A broken, failed man, jealous of her ascent. The whispers had been silent because they knew this pathetic creature was no real threat. The relief that followed this thought was narcotic, sweet, and utterly terrifying in its own right because she recognized it wasn’t entirely her own.

“No,” she whispered, to Silas or to the reflection, she didn’t know.

“It’s already in your head!” Silas screamed, his composure shattering. “It’s making you doubt me! Can’t you see? That’s how it works!”

The commotion finally summoned Frank, the night security guard, a burly man who emerged from a back room looking irritated. “Hey! What’s going on? Silas, I told you, you can’t be in here harassing residents.”

“She’s in 4B, Frank!” Silas shrieked, pointing a trembling finger at Maya. “You have to help her! You have to let me up there to destroy it!”

Frank moved with weary efficiency, grabbing Silas by the arm. “Alright, that’s it. You’re done. Come on.”

“Listen to me!” Silas fought, but he was a scarecrow against Frank’s solid bulk. His eyes, wild and pleading, locked on Maya as he was dragged toward the door. “It’s already too late for you! You’re already more it than you! You’ll see! When it leaves, you’ll be nothing! A ghost! A ghost!”

His final, ragged scream echoed in the tiled lobby as the heavy brass door swung shut behind him. Then there was silence, broken only by the hum of the fluorescent lights.

Frank brushed off his sleeves. “Sorry about that, Ms. Vance. He’s harmless, just unwell. Used to live here, had some kind of breakdown. Lost his job, his family. We try to keep him out, but he sneaks in sometimes. Don’t let him scare you.”

Maya nodded, unable to speak. Harmless. Unwell. The world’s sane, simple explanation. It was so much easier to accept than the other.

“You okay?” Frank asked, peering at her.

She made herself smile. It felt smooth, automatic. “Yes. Fine. Just startled.”

The smile felt like her reflection’s smile.

She turned and walked to the elevator, her steps measured, calm. The internal monologue had returned, a soft, soothing murmur. Poor man. Trauma can fracture the mind. Your empathy is noted, but do not let his chaos disrupt your equilibrium. You have a presentation tomorrow. You need rest.

The elevator doors closed. In the mirrored interior, her reflection regarded her with serene approval. It gave a slight, encouraging nod.

But in the pit of Maya’s stomach, Silas’s terror had taken root. It coiled around the soothing whispers, a thorny counterpoint. Aesthetic parasite. Hollowed-out shell. It’s already too late.

She let herself into 4B. The apartment welcomed her with its perfect silence, its clean lines, the faint, always-present scent of jasmine and ozone. It felt like a sanctuary. It felt like a cage.

She dropped her bag and walked straight to the bedroom, her heart a dull drumbeat in her ears.

The vintage mirror stood in its place, reflecting the serene, ordered room. And her reflection was already there, waiting for her.

But it wasn’t mimicking her.

It stood slightly off-center. In its hand, it held a large, rubber-gripped hammer—her hammer, the one from the toolbox under the kitchen sink. The reflection’s face was a mask of sympathetic concern, tinged with profound disappointment. It slowly, sadly, shook its head.

Then it smiled. A warm, knowing, utterly chilling smile.

Its lips moved, its voice a perfect mimicry of her own, but filtered through that now-familiar tone of supreme certainty. It spoke aloud, the words clear in the quiet room.

“You wouldn’t dare.”
