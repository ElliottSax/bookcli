 pause. Scratch-scratch-scratch.

Her breath caught in her throat. The sound was unnatural, a slow, deliberate rhythm that seemed to mock her. She could feel the vibrations through the floor, a low, ominous hum that seemed to resonate in her bones.

The scratching stopped. The silence was worse. She could hear her own heartbeat, a frantic drumming that seemed to echo in the empty apartment. The air was thick with tension, a palpable sense of dread that seemed to press down on her.

She forced herself to her feet, her legs trembling. The scratching started again, this time from the kitchen. She turned, her eyes wide with fear. The sound was coming from the refrigerator, a slow, deliberate scraping that seemed to echo through the empty apartment.

She took a step back, her heart pounding in her chest. The scratching stopped. The silence was deafening. She could hear her own breath, a ragged, uneven sound that seemed to echo in the empty apartment.

Then, from the bedroom, a voice.

It was a whisper, a soft, insidious sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. It was a voice she recognized, a voice that had haunted her dreams for weeks.

"Maya."

She turned, her eyes wide with terror. The voice was coming from the closet. The door was still open, the blackness within seeming to pulse with a dark, malevolent energy.

"Maya."

The voice was closer now, a soft, insidious sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. She could feel the presence, a dark, malevolent force that seemed to press down on her.

She turned and ran, her feet slapping against the hardwood floor. The voice followed her, a soft, insidious sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. She could feel the presence, a dark, malevolent force that seemed to press down on her.

She reached the front door, her fingers fumbling with the lock. The voice was a whisper, a soft, insidious sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. She could feel the presence, a dark, malevolent force that seemed to press down on her.

She reached The anonymous, chaotic streets of a major city (likely New York or similar), her fingers fumbling with the button. The voice was a whisper, a soft, insidious sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. She could feel the presence, a dark, malevolent force that seemed to press down on her.

The elevator descended, the voice fading into the distance. She closed her eyes, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The voice was a whisper, a soft, insidious sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. She could feel the presence, a dark, malevolent force that seemed to press down on her.

The elevator doors opened, and she stumbled out into the lobby. The voice was a whisper, a soft, insidious sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. She could feel the presence, a dark, malevolent force that seemed to press down on her.
