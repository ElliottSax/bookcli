 ond day, it dropped $328. His stomach clenched. The third day, it was up $1,200. The fourth, down $800. The fifth, up $1,500. The sixth, down $1,200. The seventh, up $2,100. By the end, his virtual wealth was $102,412. The net gain was modest, but the emotional journey was seismic.

He noticed something: The drops no longer felt like personal failures. They were just data points. His amygdala had been exposed to the sensation of loss without actual loss. The fear circuit had begun to habituate. The prefrontal cortex, observing this, had grown bolder.

Simulation 2: The Real Portfolio. With Anya’s guidance, Mark opened a real brokerage account, funded with $1,000. He was instructed to invest it all in a single, low-cost index fund. “This is your ‘anchor investment,’” Anya explained. “It’s not about the return. It’s about the experience. You will watch this account daily. You will feel the ups and downs. You will learn that they are not the end of the world.”

The first week, the market was flat. The second, it dropped 2%. Mark’s pulse quickened, but he didn’t panic. The third, it rose 3%. The fourth, it dropped 1%. The fifth, it rose 2%. The sixth, it dropped 3%. The seventh, it rose 4%. The eighth, it dropped 2%. The ninth, it rose 1%. The tenth, it dropped 1%. The eleventh, it rose 2%. The twelfth, it dropped 3%. The thirteenth, it rose 4%. The fourteenth, it dropped 2%. The fifteenth, it rose 3%. The sixteenth, it dropped 1%. The seventeenth, it rose 2%. The eighteenth, it dropped 2%. The nineteenth, it rose 1%. The twentieth, it dropped 3%. The twenty-first, it rose 4%.

After three months, the account was worth $1,023. The net gain was negligible, but the emotional landscape had transformed. The drops no longer triggered a fight-or-flight response. They were just part of the process. The fear circuit had been recalibrated. The prefrontal cortex had taken the wheel.

The Loss Aversion Paradox: Why the Rich Are Often the Most Risk-Averse

“Here’s the irony,” Anya said during a seminar. “The people who can afford to take risks are often the most risk-averse. They’ve spent their lives avoiding losses, and now they have the wealth to prove it. But they’ve also lost something: the ability to take calculated risks. They’ve become prisoners of their own success.”

She pointed to a study showing that high-net-worth individuals were more likely to hold cash than stocks, despite having the means to weather market downturns. “They’ve trained their amygdala to prioritize preservation over growth. They’ve become so good at avoiding losses that they’ve forgotten how to pursue gains.”

The solution, Anya explained, was to reframe risk. “It’s not about the potential for loss. It’s about the potential for gain. It’s not about the worst-case scenario. It’s about the best-case scenario. It’s not about the fear of failure. It’s about the joy of success.”
