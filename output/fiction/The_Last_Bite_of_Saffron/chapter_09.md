The polished silence of the Banque de Genève’s private viewing room, once a sanctuary of hushed wealth, now like a vacuum sealing Elara Vance in with her own dread. The air, always a perfect 20 degrees Celsius and smelling of lemon oil and old paper, turned thick and difficult to draw into her lungs. Her voice, when it finally escaped, was a frayed thread of sound. “Lys,” she repeated, the single syllable scraping her throat raw.
Her mind wasn’t racing; it was a trapped animal, slamming against the walls of her skull. *The security detail. The ones I hired to watch my back, to watch the data streams, to be the invisible wall between me and the corporate wolves.* She’d chosen them for their discretion, their flawless reputation. Now, their absence wasn’t a vacancy; it was an active, malevolent force. *They weren’t just gone. They were peeled away. Removed. Which means AgriGen knew about them. Which means they were watching the watchers. Which means every move I’ve made for the past six months…* A cold, precise sweat, like dew on a marble tomb, broke out along her hairline and trickled down her spine. The implications unfolded with horrific, fractal clarity. The security team was the only external force with the codes, the muscle, the potential leverage to interrupt a full AgriGen systems purge. And they were gone.
Lysander stood by the vast, armoured window, his silhouette a dark cut-out against the blinding white of the Geneva noon. The sunlight, filtered through nano-cleaned glass, should have been pure. To Elara, it surgical, exposing. She watched the muscles in his jaw work, a tiny, rhythmic pulse beneath the skin. He had aged a decade in the five years since she’d seen him last—not in lines, but in density. The playful lightness that used to dance around his eyes had been replaced by a mineral hardness, as if he’d been compressed under immense pressure.
“Lys,” she whispered again, the word a plea and a question. “What are we going to do?”

He turned from the window, and for a fleeting, heart-stopping moment, the glacial facade cracked. In the deep grey of his eyes, she saw a glimmer of the man who had been her anchor at university—the one who’d smuggled coffee into all-night coding sessions, whose laugh could disarm a tense boardroom of their virtual avatars. The friend who had known her before she was Elara Vance, CEO of Vance Horizon, before the inheritance, the patents, the target on her back. It was a flash of shared history, a silent acknowledgment of the sheer, absurd terror of their situation.
Then it was gone, extinguished like a spark in a downpour. His expression settled into one of grim, operational determination. The Lysander who stood before her now was the one rumoured to navigate the shadow economies of the Mediterranean, a man who traded in secrets and survival.
“We have to get out of here,” he said, his voice low but carrying a vibrational firmness that resonated in Elara’s bones. “Now. We can’t stay in the city. AgriGen will be looking for us, and they won’t stop until they find us. They don’t send polite letters, Elara. They send cleaners.”

The word ‘cleaners’ hung in the antiseptic air, conjuring images of sterile, brutal efficiency. Elara’s nod was a mechanical jerk. Flee the city. The thought was a vortex, pulling in everything she knew and loved. Her apartment overlooking the Jardin Anglais, filled with the ghostly scent of her mother’s perfume. The lab on the Rue du Rhône, where her team was likely still working, oblivious. The quiet, ordered life she had built like a fortress against the chaos of her father’s legacy. Leaving it like tearing off a limb.
But Lysander was right. The data spike he’d shown her—the one tracing back to her own servers, the one that proved AgriGen was not just a competitor but an active predator preparing to swallow her company whole and frame her for bio-terror in the process—was a death warrant. A viper in the nest, indeed. And she had been feeding it.
She took a deep breath, trying to anchor herself. The air still tasted of lemon and dust. She forced her eyes to move around the room, taking in the sensory details as if compiling a final log. The buttery glow of the aged walnut panelling. The faint, comforting hum of the electromagnetic privacy field. The cool, smooth touch of the obsidian table under her fingertips. The view of the Rhône, a silver ribbon stitching through the city’s perfect geometry. This room had been her father’s sanctuary, then hers. A place where billion-euro deals were sealed with a handshake, where the world’s volatility was locked outside. A place of safety.
Now, every elegant line like a trap. The silent door was a potential breach point. the serene view, a sniper’s sightline. The hum of the privacy field mocking—if AgriGen had compromised her security, what was a bank’s field to them? A shiver, sharp and electric, ran down her spine, settling in the pit of her stomach. *No sanctuary. No safe ground.* The realisation was a fundamental shift, a tectonic plate moving in her soul.
She turned to Lysander. Her fear was a cold pool in her gut, but rising through it was something else: a spark of defiant anger. They had invaded her life, her work, her legacy. They had turned her own protections against her. *No more.*

“Let’s go,” she said. Her voice, this time, didn’t waver. It was the voice she used in boardrooms, flat, final, and metallic.
Lysander gave a single, sharp nod. There was no discussion of plans, of destinations. Instinct and survival took over. He moved to the door, not opening it, but pressing his ear against the polished wood, his body coiled with a latent, predatory tension Elara didn’t recognise. After a heartbeat, he gestured.
They left the viewing room without a backward glance. It less like walking and more like shedding a skin—leaving behind the persona of Elara Vance, heiress and CEO. The plush, sound-deadening corridor of the bank’s private wing appeared to stretch on forever, each door a potential threat. Her heels, usually a confident click on the marble, now obscenely loud. She could hear the rustle of her tailored silk blouse, the rush of blood in her own ears. Lysander moved ahead of her, his posture casual but his eyes scanning every alcove, every reflective surface.
The transition from the bank’s cloistered hush to the Genevan midday was a physical assault. They emerged from a discreet side entrance into a narrow alley that fed onto the Rue de la Corraterie. The sunlight was a brilliant, shocking hammer blow. It warmed her skin but offered no comfort. The city sounds rushed in: the whisper of autonomous solarcabs on the clean streets, the distant chime of a tram, the murmur of tourists and businesspeople flowing like brightly coloured cells in the city’s arterial streets. The air smelled of baked stone, diesel from an old delivery van, and the faint, sweet scent of *pâtisserie* from a nearby shop—a cruel reminder of normalcy.
Lysander didn’t pause. He took her elbow, his grip firm but not painful, and steered her into the pedestrian stream. “Don’t run. Don’t look back. Simply walk,” he murmured, his lips barely moving.
They fell into step, side by side, two more affluent professionals in the heart of global finance. But to Elara, every sense was amplified, screaming. The bond between them, once built on shared dreams and intellectual sparring, had been reforged in the last ten minutes into something harder, more essential: an alliance of the hunted. It was a tether of pure necessity, stronger in that moment than any chain of obligation or past affection. They were two points of data in a hostile system, and their only algorithm was escape.
As they walked, Elara’s initial panic metabolise into a sharp, clarifying focus. The weight of her decisions pressed down on her. *I brought him here. I trusted the wrong systems. I didn’t see the rot.* But with each step, away from the gilded cage of the bank, a parallel sensation grew: a terrible, unshackling determination. They would face this. They would have to. There was no other path.
The cityscape, so familiar, now seemed a labyrinth of threats. Every uniformed municipal guard, every black-windowed vehicle, every person staring a second too long at a holoscreen like a potential agent of AgriGen. Yet, with Lysander a steady, silent presence beside her, the feato transmute. The unknown ahead was no longer just a void of danger; it was also a blank space. A place where the narrative wasn’t yet written by her enemies. A place where, perhaps, she could stop being the target and start being the hunter.
They crossed the Pont du Mont-Blanc, the lake stretching vast and blue to their left, the Jet d’Eau a stark white plume against the sky. The wind coming off the water was fresh, cutting through the urban heat and the scent of her own fear. It tugged at her hair, a sensation that like stripping away layers. With each step, the immaculate, oppressive order of Geneva’s financial district fell behind. They were moving towards the older, grittier quarters of Plainpalais, where the streets were narrower, the surveillance less omnipresent, the faces less polished.
*Leaving behind the lies,* she thought, the rhythm of walking becoming a mantra. *Leaving behind the secrets. Leaving behind the girl who thought a bank vault could protect her.* The Elara Vance who was leaving the city was not the same one who had entered the bank that morning. That woman had been anxious, suspicious. This one was terrified, but she was also awake.
Lysander finally slowed near a small, nondescript square where old men played *pétanque* in the dust. The metallic *clack* of the balls was a strangely peaceful sound. He guided her to a shaded bench, partially hidden by a sprawling linden tree.
“We can’t use anything of yours,” he replied, his eyes still scanning the square. “No accounts. No ident chips. No public transport passes. They’ll be flagged the moment they’re queried.” He pulled a small, battered paper booklet from his inner pocket—old-fashioned train tickets. “We go to Lyon first. Then we disappear.”

Elara stared at the physical tickets, artefacts from a less monitored age. “How did you…?”

“I planned for your ‘no,’” he said, a ghost of his old wryness touching his mouth. “I also planned for this.”

The simplicity of it, the tactile reality of the paper tickets, was more grounding than any grand speech. He had been thinking steps ahead while she was still reeling from the first blow. The trust she had to place in him was absolute, and terrifying. It was also her only option.
She looked back the way they had come. The gleaming towers of the banking district wer merely st visible, shimmering in the haze like a mirage of a world she could no longer inhabit. The Banque de Genève was in there somewhere, its private viewing room now just a crime scene waiting to be discovered. A place of secrets and lies, yes. But also the place where she had finally chosen to see the truth.
As they sat in the dappled shade, the scent of lime blossoms and dust around them, the immediate frenzy of flight subsided into a watchful calm. The sun beat down on the square, casting long, distorted shadows from the *pétanque* players. Elara watched the shadows stretch and merge, becoming abstract shapes on the warm stone. Theto grow longer and darker as she watched, the air thickening with the scent of coming evening, of damp earth from a nearby flower bed, and the faint, ever-present undercurrent of city decay.
She was in a world of wonder, alright. Not of magic, but of brutal, hidden mechanics. A world where a corporation could rewrite reality and paint you as its villain. A world where a friend from your past could reappear as your only lifeline. Her heart was no longer pounding with anticipation, but with a resolved, steady beat. Her senses were on high alert, parsing every sight, sound, and smell for data.
She was ready. Not to dance with the devil, but to dissect him. To follow the cold trail of data and deceit back to its source. Lysander handed her one of the tickets. The paper was rough under her fingers, real and immediate.
“Ready?” he asked, his grey eyes meeting hers. In them, she saw no false promise of safety, only the shared recognition of the long, dangerous road ahead.
Elara Vance took the ticket, and with it, the new identity of a fugitive. She stood, squaring her shoulders under the weight of the unknown.
“Ready,” she answered.
And together, they walked away from the bench, leaving the peaceful square behind, and melted into the gathering shadows of the city, two ghosts stepping off the edge of the map.
