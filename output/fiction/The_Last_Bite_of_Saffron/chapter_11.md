The room was silent, the only sound the low hum of the food truck's generator and the distant crash of waves against the cannery's rusted exterior. The air was thick with tension, and Elara Vance could feel the pressure building. She looked at each of them in turn, her eyes locking onto theirs.
Leo's face showed a mix of grief and fury, his eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep and his skin pale from shock. Simone's fingers trembled slightly as she set down her fork, her eyes fixed on the plate in front of her. Marlow's jaw was clenched, his eyes darting between Elara and the Savant reps. The two corporate representatives was waiting for something, their body language revealing a tension that was hard to ignore.
Lysander's gaze was steady, unreadable. But there was something in his eyes that Elara couldn't quite place. She couldn't be sure what it was, but she knew she had to keep pushing to get to the truth.
She took a deep breath, her hands steady as she reached for the final course. A small dish sat in front of her, its contents a perfect, golden liquid. It was the simplest of the dishes, but also the most dangerous.
"This," she said, her voice low, "is the truth. The final course. The one that reveals everything." She placed the dish in front of the Savant representative, the woman, her eyes locked onto hers.
The woman's eyes widened slightly, but she didn't move. She didn't reach for the dish. She didn't even look at it. Elara could see the fear in her eyes, the knowledge that she had been caught.
"You knew," Elara said, her voice barely above a whisper. "You knew what you were doing. You knew the risks. And you did it anyway." The words hung in the air.
The woman's lips parted, but no sound came out. Her eyes flicked to the man beside her, then back to Elara. There was a moment of silence, a moment of tension between them.
Then, with a sudden motion, the woman pushed back her chair and stood. The dish clattered to the floor, the golden liquid spilling across the concrete. "You have no proof," she replied, her voice cold, her eyes hard. "You have no evidence. You have nothing but speculation and a wild theory."

Elara didn't flinch. She just stood there, her gaze steady, her hands at her sides. "No," she said, her voice calm, her eyes locked on the woman's. "I have the truth. And the truth is all I need."

The woman's lips curled into a sneer. "The truth is a luxury," she answered. "And luxuries are for those who can afford them."

Elara smiled, a slow, cold smile. "Then it's a good thing I'm not a luxury," she said. "It's a good thing I'm a necessity."

The woman's eyes narrowed, but she didn't say anything. She just stood there, her body tense, her eyes locked on Elara's. Then, with a sudden motion, she turned and fled. The sound of her heels echoed through the cannery, growing fainter until it was swallowed by the crash of the waves.
Elara didn't move. She simply stood there, her gaze locked on the spot where the woman had been, her hands at her sides. Then, slowly, she turned to face the others. Leo, his face a mask of grief and fury. Simone, her fingers trembling slightly as she set down her fork. Marlow, his jaw clenched, his eyes darting between her and the Savant reps. The two corporate representatives, their expressions carefully neutral, but their body language revealing a tension that was hard to ignore.
She placed the dish in front of the Savant representative, the man. The one who had been watching her with such careful detachment. The one who had, Elara was now certain, been the one to deliver the poisoned meal to Aris Thorne. The man's eyes widened slightly, but he didn't move. He didn't reach for the dish. He didn't even look at it.
The air hummed with tension as Elara waited, her eyes locked on the man’s. She could see the fear in them—the knowledge he’d been caught, that the truth was finally out. Then, like a dish coming together at the last moment, it all clicked. The pieces fell into place, and Elara saw the truth as clearly as a chef recognizing a finished plate.
She knew she had to act, to bring the perpetrators to justice. The man’s eyes glazed over, like a softly cooked egg, and he talk, his words spilling out like a thin, steady sauce. "I didn’t know what I was getting into," he whispered. "I just wanted to help. To make some money. But then I saw the look in her eyes—the fear, the desperation. I knew I was in too deep."

Elara listened, her gaze fixed on his face. She saw the fear, the guilt, the shame written there, and she knew she had to push him, to uncover the truth behind what had been happening.
As he spoke, the cannery grew quieter. Only the soft hum of the food truck’s generator and the distant crash of waves against the rusted walls broke the silence. The air thick and heavy, like a rich broth, and Elara sensed she was close to the truth, close to secrets long kept hidden.
Then, once more, everything came together. The pieces locked into place. Elara saw the whole picture, and she knew it was time to move, to make sure justice was done.

She leaned forward, her eyes holding his like a chef confronting someone who’d taken her recipe. "Tell me moremurmuredhe said, her voice low and steady.
