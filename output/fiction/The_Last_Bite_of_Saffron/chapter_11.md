 lighted in his review. The lamb. The killer knew Aris would eat it all. And they knew the saffron would turn the poison into a death sentence.”

The room was silent. The only sound was the low hum of the food truck’s generator and the distant crash of waves against the cannery’s rusted exterior.

Elara Vance looked at each of them in turn. Leo, his face a mask of grief and fury. Simone, her fingers trembling slightly as she set down her fork. Marlow, his jaw clenched, his eyes darting between her and the Savant reps. The two corporate representatives, their expressions carefully neutral, but their body language betraying a tension that was almost palpable.

And then there was Lysander. His gaze was steady, unreadable. But there was something in his eyes—a flicker of something she couldn’t quite place. Respect? Admiration? Or was it something darker?

She took a deep breath, her hands steady as she reached for the final course. A small, delicate dish, barely larger than a thimble. Inside, a single, perfect saffron thread floated in a pool of clear, golden liquid. It was the simplest of the dishes, the most unassuming. But it was also the most dangerous.

“This,” she said, her voice low, “is the truth. The final course. The one that reveals everything.”

She placed the dish in front of the Savant representative, the woman. The one who had been watching her with such careful detachment. The one who had, Elara Vance was now certain, been the one to deliver the poisoned meal to Aris.

The woman’s eyes widened slightly, but she didn’t move. She didn’t reach for the dish. She didn’t even look at it.

“You knew,” Elara Vance said, her voice barely above a whisper. “You knew what you were doing. You knew the risks. And you did it anyway.”

The woman’s lips parted, but no sound came out. Her eyes flicked to the man beside her, then back to Elara Vance. There was a moment of silence, a moment of tension that stretched like a wire between them.

And then, with a sudden, violent motion, the woman pushed back her chair and stood. The dish clattered to the floor, the golden liquid spilling across the concrete like a pool of liquid gold.

“You have no proof,” she said, her voice cold, her eyes hard. “You have no evidence. You have nothing but speculation and a wild theory.”

Elara Vance didn’t flinch. She didn’t move. She just stood there, her gaze steady, her hands at her sides.

“No,” she said, her voice calm, her eyes locked on the woman’s. “I have the truth. And the truth is all I need.”

The woman’s lips curled into a sneer. “The truth is a luxury,” she said. “And luxuries are for those who can afford them.”

Elara Vance smiled, a slow, cold smile. “Then it’s a good thing I’m not a luxury,” she said. “It’s a good thing I’m a necessity.”

The woman’s eyes narrowed, but she didn’t say anything. She just stood there, her body tense, her eyes locked on Elara Vance’s.

And then, with a sudden, violent motion, she turned and fled. The sound of her heels echoed through the vast, empty cannery, growing fainter and fainter until it was swallowed by the crash of the waves.

Elara Vance didn’t move. She didn’t even blink. She just stood there, her gaze locked on the spot where the woman had been, her hands at her sides.

And then, slowly, she turned to face the others. Leo, his face a mask of grief and fury. Simone, her fingers trembling slightly as she set down her fork. Marlow, his jaw clenched, his eyes darting between her and the Savant reps. The two corporate representatives, their expressions carefully neutral, but their body language betraying a tension that was almost palpable.

She placed the dish in front of the Savant representative, the man. The one who had been watching her with such careful detachment. The one who had, Elara Vance was now certain, been the one to deliver the poisoned meal to Aris.

The man’s eyes widened slightly, but he didn’t move. He didn’t reach for the dish. He didn’t even look at it.
