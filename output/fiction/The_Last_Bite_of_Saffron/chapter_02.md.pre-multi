Chapter 2: Ghosts in the Kitchen

The rain had settled into a persistent, whispering drizzle by the time Detective Kaito Reyes found her. Elara was at The Last Bite, ostensibly prepping for a lunch service that felt as distant as the moon. Her hands moved on autopilot: chiffonading basil, its aniseed perfume sharp in the damp air, while a pot of duck confit burbled softly on the portable induction burner, its scent of rendered fat and thyme a small, defiant comfort.

He didn’t look like a detective. That was her first, foolish thought. He was tall, lean, wearing a charcoal wool coat damp at the shoulders, and he carried the scent of rain and good coffee. His face was all angles, softened only by eyes that missed nothing, taking in the gleaming stainless steel of her truck, the meticulous order of her mise en place, the way her knuckles whitened around her chef’s knife.

“Ms. Vance? I’m Detective Reyes. I have some questions about Anton Volkov.”

His voice was calm, a low baritone that didn’t try to fill the space. It simply occupied it, leaving no room for evasion.

“I heard,” she said, not looking up, focusing on the emerald-green ribbons of basil. “He died at a party. A supper club.”

“The Cellar Door,” Reyes supplied. He didn’t flash a badge; his authority was quieter, more invasive. “You knew him?”

Elara’s knife stilled. “He was a critic. I’m a chef. It was a professional acquaintance. He reviewed my food truck last year.” Two stars. ‘Promising but derivative. A shadow chasing a greater light.’

“And your mentor, Aris Thorne? He knew Volkov well, didn’t he?”

The name, spoken in this context, was a physical blow. The kitchen around her seemed to tilt. The memory of Aris—his flour-dusted apron, his laugh that started deep in his belly, the way he could identify a spice blindfolded by its scent alone—collided with the cold reality of this damp morning and a dead critic.

“Aris has been gone for three years,” she said, her voice tighter than she intended.

“I know. I’ve read the file. His accident.” Reyes paused, and the word hung between them, swollen with unspoken doubt. “Volkov’s death wasn’t an accident, Ms. Vance. The preliminary tox screen shows a toxin. A rare one. Derived from the Abrus precatorius seed. Rosary pea.”

Elara’s breath caught. Culinary-grade toxins were a dark lore among certain circles. A whisper, a horror story. Rosary pea, beautiful and deadly; if prepared with a specific, cruel expertise, it could be refined into a poison that mimicked catastrophic organ failure, leaving almost no trace unless you knew exactly what to look for. It was a poisoner’s poison. An artist’s poison.

“That’s… incredibly specific,” she managed.

“It is. And the dish he ate right before he died was a saffron risotto. A very particular one, we’re told. A ‘Saffron Symphony.’”

The world narrowed to the sound of the rain on the truck’s roof, a thousand tiny drumbeats. The confit oil popped. She felt the ghost of Aris’s hand on her shoulder, guiding her through the precise, rhythmic toasting of the threads, the slow addition of warm stock, the alchemy that turned rice into gold.

“That was Aris’s dish,” she whispered. “No one makes it. No one could. Not like him.”

“Someone did,” Reyes said softly. “And they served it to Volkov in a locked room full of the city’s best foodies. And then he died. The connection is what matters, Ms. Vance. Between your mentor, that dish, and this critic.”

He questioned her for an hour, his notebook remaining mostly closed. He was more interested in the spaces between her words—her hesitation when describing Aris’s rivalry with Volkov (it was more than rivalry, it was a feud that had cost Aris a Michelin star), the way her voice hollowed out when she spoke of the night Aris died (a slip in his own kitchen, a blow to the head, a pan of smoking oil left unattended). Reyes listened to her history with the hunger of a man starved for context, not facts.

When he finally left, handing her a card that felt too light for the weight it carried, he offered one last, casual observation. “The risotto served last night was perfect, by all accounts. As good as Thorne’s. Maybe better. The chef who made it was masked. A ‘guest chef for the evening.’ No one knows who it was.”

Alone again, the silence in the truck was no longer peaceful. It was accusatory. The ghost of the Saffron Symphony lingered in the air, a taunt. Someone had not only resurrected it but had used it as a vessel for murder. To tarnish Aris’s legacy, or to honor it in the most twisted way possible? She had to know. The police would follow procedure. They would dig into finances, enemies, forensics. But they wouldn’t understand the language of the kitchen, the whispers of spice, the grudges that simmered for years like a slow-cooked sauce. They wouldn’t know where to look.

She knew.

Le Jardin de Nuit was a corpse of a building. The once-proud façade, with its art nouveau lettering now cracked and faded, hunched between a parking garage and a sleek tech startup. The city had moved on, but the restaurant, where Aris had reigned and where he had fallen, remained, a sealed tomb.

Elara used an old key, its teeth worn smooth, on the service entrance in the alley. The lock gave with a groan that echoed in the hollow darkness within.

The smell hit her first. Not the ghost of garlic and seared meat, but the flat, stale odor of neglect, of dust and damp concrete, undercut by a faint, sweet hint of mildew. She flicked on her flashlight. The beam cut through the gloom, illuminating the familiar topography of disaster. Here was the giant Vulcan range, its burners cold and cobwebbed. There, the long stainless steel table where she’d first learned to properly tourne a potato, its surface now dull and etched with shadows.

Her heart was a frantic bird in her throat. Every step echoed. She moved past the dish pit, past the walk-in cooler whose door hung slightly ajar, a black maw. She was heading for the office, a tiny room tucked behind the dry stores, but her feet dragged her to the heart of the kitchen.

The spot was unremarkable. Re-tiled years after the accident. But she saw it with a blistering clarity: the shimmer of spilled oil on the floor, the heavy, twelve-inch cast iron pan skidding from the stove, Aris’s look of surprise more than pain as he fell, the terrible, wet crack as his head met the corner of the table leg. She had been the one to find him. She had been late that night, detained by a supplier. The guilt, a sour, permanent taste in her mouth, rose up anew.

She forced herself into the office. It had been cleared out after the inquest, the contents boxed for storage. The desk was gone. Only empty shelves and a filing cabinet with its drawers hanging open like slack jaws remained. But Aris had been a creature of habit, of secrets. She knelt in the corner, her fingers finding the loose baseboard she’d seen him fiddle with a hundred times. A sharp tug, and it came away.

The cavity behind it was empty.

A cold that had nothing to do with the damp concrete seeped into her bones. Aris’s cahier des secrets—his private recipe journal, a moleskine book bound in stained blue leather—was gone. He called it his “ghost menu,” ideas too strange, too personal, or too dangerous for the restaurant. The true, unadulterated recipe for the Saffron Symphony was in there. Not the one he gave to the food magazines, but the one with his marginalia: “Toast threads in ghee, not oil. The dairy fat carries the fragrance deeper.” “Use a whisper of amchur at the end. The sour lifts the gold.” “The rice must be frightened, not stirred.”

Someone had taken it. Someone who knew his secrets as intimately as she did.
Her old contact was a man named Silas, who ran a specialty purveyor shop called The Obscura Market. He dealt in thousand-dollar truffles, illegal Caspian caviar, and information. His shop was a cluttered cave of olfactory wonders: sacks of I
