Chapter 5: Bitter Rivals and Old Flames

Chapter 5: Bitter Rivals and Old Flames

The rain in Paris had a different texture to London’s. In London, it was a persistent, grey smear. Here, it fell in sudden, theatrical bursts, silver needles that turned the cobblestones of Le Marais into dark, gleaming mirrors. Elara Vance stood under the green awning of Boulangerie de la Lune, the scent of Simone’s famous burnt-butter croissants curling through the damp air like a taunt. It was a smell that once meant safety, shared secrets over flour-dusted counters, and dreams whispered before dawn. Now, it was the aroma of a crime scene—the second name on her stolen list.

She had come from Leo’s place, her nerves still vibrating from that encounter. His restaurant, L’Éclat, was a temple of modernist cuisine, all cool marble and hushed tones, a world away from the warm, chaotic kitchens of their youth. He’d been polishing a stack of iridescent dessert plates when she’d found him, his once-familiar hands moving with a new, clinical precision.

“Elara Vance.” He hadn’t looked up. “I heard about Aris. A tragedy.” The word was as empty as one of his sculpted chocolate spheres.

Their conversation had been a brittle dance of half-truths and old wounds. He denied any involvement with the list, with the deaths, his voice a flat line. But then, as a waiter passed, he’d leaned in, the citrus-and-sandalwood cologne he now wore a stranger’s scent. “Anton Volkov was about to publish a review. Not a critique—an evisceration. He called L’Éclat ‘a stunning monument to a chef’s ego, utterly devoid of soul.’ It would have ended me.”

He’d said it not as a confession, but as a fact. A motive, laid out as neatly as the amuse-bouche on his pass. When she’d left, he’d walked her to the service entrance, his hand briefly on her elbow. In the shadow of a overflowing dumpster, he’d pressed a small, cold object into her palm—a USB drive. His eyes, the same hazel that had once watched her with adoration, were shuttered. “Aris gave this to me for safekeeping, years ago. After you left. I was too jealous to ever give it to you.” Before she could speak, he’d melted back into the stainless-steel glow of his kitchen.

Now, the drive was a searing coal in her coat pocket, outshone only by the deeper burn of having to face Simone.

The bakery bell tinkled with a cruel cheerfulness. Inside, the warmth was a physical wall, rich with the perfume of yeast, caramelizing sugar, and the faint, tangy note of fermenting sourdough starter. It was a smell that bypassed the brain and went straight to the heart, a Proustian assault. Behind the counter, dusted in a fine snow of powdered sugar, was Simone.

Time had sharpened her. The soft, round-faced girl was gone, replaced by a woman with a severe blonde bob and a gaze that could chill crème anglaise. She was piping delicate rosettes on a row of religieuses, her movements swift and exact. A phone was propped nearby, broadcasting a silent video of her own hands at work—for her millions of followers. Pâtissière en Vogue. The influencer.

Simone looked up. For a fraction of a second, the professional mask slipped, and Elara Vance saw raw, undiluted shock, followed by a venom so potent the air between them seemed to curdle.

“Well,” Simone said, her voice sweet as arsenic. “The ghost of kitchens past. Come to poison the well?”

“Hello, Simone.”

“I’m busy. As you can see.” She gestured with her piping bag, not stopping her work. The chocolate rosettes were perfect, uniform, lifeless.

“I need to talk to you. About Aris. About Dimitri Anton Volkov.”

Simone let out a short, hard laugh. “Of course you do. The great Elara Vance Vance, back to dig up the past. You have a real talent for leaving corpses in your wake, don’t you?”

The words were a physical blow. “That’s not fair.”

“Fair?” Simone finally set the bag down. She wiped her hands on her apron, leaving brown smears. “You left, Elara Vance. You didn’t just walk out on Leo, or on Aris. You walked out on us. On the team. The review of La Nymphe came out a week later. ‘A promising concept marred by inconsistent execution and, reportedly, toxic kitchen dynamics.’ They blamed me for the soufflé that fell. They said Leo’s sauces were ‘strained.’ Aris never got another investor. And you were gone. Off to your new life. You destroyed it. You destroyed us.”

Elara Vance felt the old guilt, stale and heavy, rise in her throat. She had run. From Leo’s suffocating ambition, from the pressure of Aris’s legacy, from the fear that she would never be more than a competent shadow in their brilliant light. She hadn’t considered the collateral damage.

“I didn’t know it would fall on you,” Elara Vance said, the defense sounding weak even to her.

“You didn’t stick around to find out.” Simone picked up a paring knife and began scoring lines into a block of dark chocolate with violent precision. The sound was like tiny bones breaking. “Why are you really here? The police already came. I told them I hadn’t seen Aris in months. It was true.”

“Someone killed him, Simone. And Anton Volkov. Someone who knew about the Saffron Symphony. Someone who could replicate it perfectly.”

The knife stilled. Simone’s eyes, a frosty blue, met hers. “And you think that’s me? You think after spending a decade building this,” she gestured around the pristine, Instagram-ready bakery, “I’d throw it away to play murderer over a recipe? A recipe you helped create?”

“The list had your name on it.”

A strange, brittle smile touched Simone’s lips. “Did it? How flattering. I’m in such illustrious company.” She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. “You want a culinary secret, Elara Vance? Here’s one. The secret to my tarte au citron isn’t in the crust or the curd. It’s a pinch of smoked salt in the meringue. It doesn’t taste smoky. It just makes the sweet brighter, the sour sharper. It highlights. It defines. That’s what you did. You were the smoked salt in our lives. And then you were gone, and everything just tasted… flat.”

The cruelty was so specific, so chef-like, it stole Elara Vance’s breath. This wasn’t just anger; it was a refined, aged bitterness, reduced to its most potent essence.

“I’m trying to find who did this,” Elara Vance managed.

“Then look in a mirror,” Simone spat. “Or better yet, look at the shining stars you left behind. The ones still fighting for a seat at a table you abandoned. Now get out of my shop. You’re scaring the customers.”

Elara Vance turned. The few patrons in the café were indeed staring, their expressions a mix of curiosity and discomfort. She walked out, the bell’s tinkle sounding like a death knell.

The rain had softened to a mist. She stumbled away from the bakery’s glow, the confrontation playing on a loop in her mind. Simone’s hatred was real, a viable fuel for violence. But the meticulous, poetic replication of the Symphony? That didn’t fit Simone’s blunt-force trauma style. It required a deeper, more intimate knowledge—not just of the recipe, but of its context, its meaning to Aris.

Aris’s inner circle. It had been tiny. Herself, Leo, Simone… and Lysander. The connection she’d unearthed in the archives whispered to her. Aris and Lysander, young cooks together in Crete, a falling out so severe neither ever spoke of it. A rivalry buried for decades. Until now.

She was so lost in the labyrinth of her thoughts she didn’t hear the engine until it was too late.

It was a low growl, rising to a roar. Headlights, blinding in the grey twilight, swerved from a side alley, aiming straight for her. There was no time to think. Elara Vance threw herself sideways, her shoulder connecting hard with the wet stone of a building. The car—a dark sedan, make and model a blur—missed her by inches, a rush of displaced air and spray from the gutter soaking her legs. It sped off, tires screaming on the wet cobbles, disappearing around a corner.

She lay there, gasping, the cold seep of the pavement through her clothes, the coppery taste of adrenaline in her mouth. It was no accident. The alley had been empty; the car had waited, then aimed.

Shaking, she pushed herself up. Her hands were scraped, her coat torn. The USB drive in her pocket seemed to pulse with a malevolent heat. Leo’s jealous safeguard. Simone’s toxic blame. A car trying to erase her from the equation.

They were all pieces, but the puzzle was still a formless void. The killer wasn’t just tying up loose ends. They were following a recipe. And Elara Vance realized, with a chill that had nothing to do with the rain, that she was no longer just an investigator.

She was an ingredient.

Later, in the sterile safety of her rented room near Place des Vosges, Elara Vance examined the USB drive. It was a generic, black plastic stick, unremarkable. On her laptop, it contained a single folder, labelled simply: E.

Her hands trembled as she clicked it open.

Inside were not documents, but a series of video files, dated from over a decade ago. The first one showed a shaky, handheld scene: Aris’s old kitchen in Montmartre. The counters were cluttered in the way she remembered, a beautiful chaos. And there she was, younger, her hair tied in a messy bun, laughing at something off-camera.

“—so you see, Elara Vance,” Aris’s voice, warm and off-mic, said. “The saffron is not a colour, not just a flavour. It is the sunlight trapped in a stigma. You must add it with reverence, or it becomes mere perfume.”

It was a lesson. One of hundreds. But Leo had recorded this one.

She scrolled. More clips. Her perfecting a hollandaise. Aris showing her how to clean a sea urchin. Then, a later date. Her and Leo, after service, sharing a bottle of wine, his arm around her, her head on his shoulder. The footage was intimate, stolen. It felt like a violation.

The final file was dated a week before she left Paris for good. The scene was the same kitchen, but at night. She was arguing with Aris. Her younger self was gesturing wildly, tears streaking her flour-dusted cheeks.

“You’re holding me back!” her own voice, strained and desperate, echoed in the quiet room. “Leo gets the Times review, Simone gets the pastry feature! I just get more lessons! When is it my turn?”

Aris’s face, older and wearier than she’d wanted to remember, was a mask of sorrow. “Your turn will come, koukla. But a tree that grows too fast has shallow roots. Your roots are not here. Not in this kitchen. Not with him.”

“You’re wrong,” young Elara Vance had whispered, heartbreak in every syllable. “You’re all wrong about me.”

She had stormed out. The camera, presumably still in Leo’s hidden hand, lingered on Aris. The old man sighed, walked to his safe—the very same one that had been emptied—and pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook. He looked directly at the camera’s hidden lens, his eyes full of a profound and weary knowledge.

“For when she is ready,” he said softly, to no one in the room. To Leo. To the future. “The roots will find their ground.”

The video ended.

Elara Vance sat back, tears streaming down her face. He had known. He had known Leo was recording, hoarding these pieces of her. He had known she would leave. And he had left something for her anyway, entrusting it to the very man whose jealousy would keep it from her.

She opened the other file in the folder—a scan of the notebook page. It wasn’t the Saffron Symphony. It was a recipe, but written in Aris’s cryptic style. A recipe for a dish called “Nostos”—the Greek word for a homecoming, a return.

Ingredients, it began. One heart, thoroughly bruised. One mind, clarified by exile. A measure of truth, to taste. The bitter zest of regret. A foundation of stolen time.

Method: Begin with a cold, empty hearth. Examine the bruises; they are your map. Clarify the mind over the low flame of solitude. This will take years. Do not rush. When the truth begins to foam, add the regret. It will sputter. Let it. The reaction is necessary. Fold in the stolen time gently; it is fragile. The mixture will seem broken. It is not. It is transforming. Pour into the prepared foundation. The baking is the hardest part. You will live in the oven. When you emerge, you will not recognize yourself. This is the point. Serve alone, in silence. Serves: one.

It was a recipe for a life. Her life. Her exile. Her return.

At the bottom, in different ink, was a postscript.

P.S. For the symphony, the key is not the saffron, but the vessel. The plate is the palate. Lysander knows this. He always cared more for the canvas than the paint. Find the source. Find the earth.*

The earth. The clay. The plate from the Cellar Door.

The hook: The recipe was a map, and Aris had left it for her, knowing the journey would be dangerous. But as she read the final line again, a new, more terrifying thought crystallized. What if “Nostos” wasn’t just a recipe for her redemption? What if it was also the blueprint for Aris’s own end—a deliberate, tragic homecoming he had orchestrated, with her as the final, unwitting ingredient?
