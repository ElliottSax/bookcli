## Chapter

The rain in Paris different from London's. In London, it was a steady, grey drizzle that seeped into your bones and lingered for days, a damp companion that muffled sound and bleached colour from the world. In Paris, it came in sudden, theatrical bursts, as if the sky had grown bored of its own blue perfection. One moment, the limestone façades of Le Marais glowed honey-gold in the afternoon light; the next, the clouds bruised purple and emptied themselves with a violent sigh. The rain turned the cobblestones into dark, shining mosaics, each wet stone reflecting the fractured glow of streetlamps and the neon *tabac* signs in liquid gold and electric green. It would vanish as quickly as it appeared, leaving the air sharp with the scent of wet stone, wet leaves, and the underlying tang of diesel from the delivery vans idling on the narrow streets.
Elara Vance stood under the deep green awning of the Boulangerie de la Lune, the smell of burnt-butter croissants and baking baguettes wrapping around her like a ghost. This specific, glorious scent—caramelised dairy and wheat—used to mean safety. It was the smell of 4 a.m. in a different kitchen, a lifetime ago, of flour-dusted counters and shared secrets whispered over rolling pins, of Leo’s laughter as he shaped *pain au chocolat* with hands still clumsy with youth. Now, it was the smell of a crime scene. It was the exact aroma that had hung in the air of Anton Volkov’s minimalist apartment, a cruel, domestic counterpoint to the saffron-tinged terror that had killed him. It was the scent attached to the second name on her stolen, cryptic list: *Boulangerie de la Lune, 4th arr.* A place, not a person. A destination that now like a trap.
She pulled her thin jacket tighter, the damp cold seeping through the wool. The rain drummed a relentless, syncopated rhythm on the canvas above her, a sound that appeared to echo the frantic beat of her own heart. *How did I get here?* The question was a loop in her mind, a silent scream beneath the city’s noise. The answer was a series of images, sharp as shattered porcelain: the feel of the hidden compartment in Aris’s old recipe ledger, the crackle of the aged paper as she unfolded the list, the stark, typewritten names that meant nothing and everything. Lysander’s frightened eyes in a London pub. The taste of Anton’s last meal—saffron, earthy and metallic, the flavour of fear itself—still haunting her palate, a phantom bitterness she couldn’t swallow away.
She had just come from Leo. Leo, who was now *Chef Léo Martin* of L'Éclat, a name printed in sleek fonts on glossy guides. The walk from his restaurant to this awning had been a blur of wet pavement and racing thoughts. L'Éclat was a temple of modern gastronomy, a space of cool, veined marble, hushed taupe tones, and lighting so precise it surgical. It was a universe away from the warm, chaotic kitchens of their apprenticeship, where steam fogged the windows and the air was thick with shouting, garlic, and ambition. No warmth of copper pans here, only the cold gleam of stainless steel.
She’d found him in the empty dining room after the lunch service, the silence a physical presence. He was at a service station, polishing a stack of pristine, white dessert plates. The soft, rhythmic whisper of the cloth on porcelain—*swish, click, swish, click*—was the only sound. His hands, those hands she once knew as well as her own—the scar on his thumb from a mandoline, the flour perpetually under his nails—now moved with a detached, clinical precision. They were a surgeon’s hands, a curator’s hands. Not a cook’s.
"Elara Vance."

He said her name without looking up, his voice flat, acknowledging a fact, not a person. His own reflection, distorted and watchful, stared back at him from the convex curve of the plate he held.
"I heard about Aris," he continued, the cloth pausing for a half-second. "It’s a tragedy."

The word *tragedy* landed between them like a dropped spoon, hollow and cheap. It was the word used in press releases and polite condolences. It didn’t contain the reality of Aris—his bear-like hugs that smelled of oregano and cigar smoke, his bellowing laugh that could shake a stack of pots, the way his eyes had crinkled when she’d finally mastered her mother’s *spanakopita*. The hole his death had torn in the world was not a tragedy; it was a void. A silence where a symphony of life had been. Elara ache of it, fresh and raw, a lump in her throat she couldn’t clear.
"Did you?" she managed, her own voice sounding strange to her ears. "He was a father to you, too. Once."

Leo’s jaw tightened, a minute movement. He set the plate down with a quiet finality. "That was a long time ago, Elara. We all moved on. He to his little taverna, you to… whatever it is you do. And I to this." A gesture, slight but encompassing, took in the silent, expensive room.
Their conversation that followed was a brittle dance on a floor of broken glass. She mentioned the list, watching his face. No flicker. She spoke of Anton, of Lysander’s fear. His answers were smooth, rehearsed—denials wrapped in the bland language of professional regret. He was sorry for their losses. He was busy with a new menu, with investors. His world was here, in this pristine space. But when he finally lifted his gaze to meet hers, the professional mask slipped for an instant. His eyes, once the colour of strong tea, seemed washed out, like the dregs left in a cup overnight. Cold. Empty.
A young waiter, his apron impossibly white, passed through the room carrying a crate of sparkling glassware. The moment his footsteps faded, Leo leaned forward. The movement was swift, predatory. The scent of him hit her then—not kitchen smells of sweat and stock, but a expensive, woody cologne, something with sandalwood and vetiver. It was the smell of a stranger.
"Anton Volkov," he whispered, his lips barely moving, the words a dry rustle in the quiet room. "He was going to publish a review. Not a critique—an evisceration. A forensic dismantling of my ‘culinary philosophy.’ He had notes, recordings. It would have destroyed me. The investors, the guides, the bookings… *poof*." He didn’t say *I killed him*. He stated a sequence of events, a cause and its inevitable effect, laid out as neatly as the components of a dish on his counter. A motive, not a confession.
The chill that went through Elara had nothing to do with the restaurant’s air conditioning. It was the chill of understanding. This was about survival, but not of the body—of the ego, the empire, the carefully constructed identity of *Chef Léo Martin*.
When she left, he walked her not to the grand entrance with its etched-glass doors, but to the unmarked service exit at the back. The corridor was narrow, lit by a single flickering fluorescent tube that buzzed like an angry insect. The air smelled of bleach and stale grease. At the door, his hand came to rest on her elbow. The touch was brief, but possessive, a reminder of an old claim, or a new threat.
In the shadow of a overflowing dumpster, its sour, sweet stench of rotting food and coffee grounds enveloping them, he pressed a small, cold object into her palm. A USB drive.
"Some things are better left unseasoned, Elara," he murmured, his face half in darkness. "But you were always one for tasting everything, weren’t you?"

His eyes, in the dim, greasy lightto hold a universe of unspoken words—a warning, a plea, a challenge. She couldn’t decipher it. Then he was gone, the metal door clicking shut with a sound of absolute finality.
Now, under the bakery awning, her fist clenched around the USB drive until its edges bit into her palm. The sense of unease was no longer a seed; it was a vine, twisting around her ribs, constricting her breath. Leo was involved. Deeply. He had a motive for Anton. Did he have one for Aris? Was her name, by association, now on some unseen menu?
She had to move. Standing still made her a target. She stepped out from the awning, the rain having softened to a fine mist that beaded on her hair and lashes. The city was in its late afternoon rhythm—the shriek of a scooter, the grumble of a bus, the fragmented conversations from café terraces where people huddled under heaters. She walked quickly, without clear direction, her eyes scanning the crowds not for landmarks, but for anomalies: a face that turned away too quickly, a figure that matched her pace from across the street. The neon signs bled their colours onto the wet pavement—red from a *pharmacie*, blue from a *cinéma*—creating a swirling, abstract painting at her feet.
Her mind was a split screen. One half replayed the sterile chill of L'Éclat, Leo’s empty eyes. The other was plunged into the past: the roaring heat of Aris’s kitchen, the smell of frying garlic and lemon, the feel of sticky phyllo dough under her fingers. The list was the bridge between them. A puzzle written in blood and saffron. She was no detective, just a cook who knew about ingredients. And this list was a recipe for disaster, each name a potential ingredient in a dish of death. She had to follow it, taste each component, no matter how bitter.
Finding a small, anonymous café with steamed-up windows, she slipped into a corner booth, her back to the wall. The air was thick with the smell of espresso and damp wool. She ordered a *café allongé* she didn’t want and plugged the USB drive into her laptop, shielding the screen with her body.
The drive contained a single folder, labelled simply: **SOURCES**. Inside were scanned invoices, emails, shipping manifests. They traced a network. Truffles from Umbria, caviar from the Caspian, rare *épices* from Madagascar—all flowing not to L'Éclat, but to a shell company, and from there to a series of private addresses across Paris. One address, an elegant townhouse in the 16th, was starred. A name was associated with it in a blurred email signature: **G. de H.**

The last document was a photo, clearly taken from a hidden phone. It showed a walk-in refrigerator, but not for food. On stainless steel shelves lay rows of vacuum-sealed bags, filled with dark, earthy matter. Truffles? But the labelling was clinical, with codes and dates. It was the background that chilled her: on the wall, barely in frame, was a framed, vintage poster for the *Boulangerie de la Lune*, from the 1920s.
The bakery. The source. The second name on her list.
Her coffee grew cold. The café filled and emptied around her as the evening drew in. The rain started again, sheeting down the windows, turning the outside world into a watery impressionist painting. Elara’s eyes burned from staring at the screen, her mind connecting dots into a terrifying constellation. This wasn’t simply about a bad review. This was about a supply chain. Something was being distributed under the cover of luxury ingredients. And Leo, her Leo, was in the middle of it. Had Aris found out? Was that why he had the list?
The exhaustion was a physical weight, pulling at her shoulders, making her lids droop. She fought it, pinching the skin on her wrist, the sharp pain a temporary anchor. Sleep was a luxury she couldn’t afford. The puzzle pieces were swirling, but they hadn’t locked into place. She needed to see the bakery, not as a nostalgic landmark, but as a crime scene.
As night fell properly, the mist turning into another downpour, she left the café. The streets of Le Marais were quieter now, the fashionable crowds replaced by residents walking dogs and late workers hurrying home. The *Boulangerie de la Lune* was dark, its iron grille pulled down. She stood across the street, in a doorway, watching. The smell was fainter now, just a memory in the wet air.
For an hour, nothing. Then merely st past ten, a plain white van, unmarked, turned into the alley beside the bakery. Its headlights were off. Elara’s pulse thudded in her ears, louder than the rain. A figure emerged from the shadows near the bakery’s service entrance—not a baker in whites, but a man in a dark coat. A brief exchange, the flash of a phone screen illuminating two faces for a second. A single crate was transferred from the van to the bakery’s back door. The van left as silently as it had arrived.
The game was no longer an abstraction. It was here, on this wet street, moving in the shadows. Leo had given her the key, but was it a weapon or a warrant for her own execution? He had tasted the danger and found it bitter. Now he was passing the plate to her.
She was being watched. She it in the prickle on her neck, in the way the silence after the van’s departure seemed appeared to Not just by Leo, or by the man in the dark coat. By the city itself, with its beautiful, indifferent eyes. She was a foreign ingredient in its ancient recipe.
Pulling her hood up, Elara melted away from the doorway, becoming another shadow in the rain-slicked night. She had to keep moving. Forward was the only direction left. The taste of saffron and fear was now mingled with the acidic bite of coffee and the cold, metallic tang of the USB drive. The list had led her to Paris, to Leo, to this dark alley. The next name, the next address, awaited. And she would follow it, into the heart of the kitchen where this terrible feast was being prepared, because the only thing more terrifying than the truth was not knowing it at all. The hours stretched ahead, dark and uncertain. Her eyes were heavy, but she forced them open, wide against the gleaming, deceptive night.
