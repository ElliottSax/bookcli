Here is the expanded chapter:

Chapter 10: The Cook's Confession

The rain had turned to a persistent, icy mist by the time Elara Vance pushed open the heavy door to Le Creuset, the kitchen supply warehouse in the city's industrial quarter. It was a cathedral of culinary hardware, a cavernous space smelling of steel, seasoned cast iron, and dust. Racks of copper pots glowed dully in the security lights, and towers of stainless steel bowls rose like metallic stalagmites. It was Marlow's sanctuary, the place he came to "think," he'd once told her, running his fingers over the perfect rivets of a Japanese deba knife.

She found him in the sharpening station, a small nook at the back. He wasn't sharpening. He was just sitting on a stool, staring at the whirring stone of a Tormek machine, his broad shoulders slumped. The scent of ozone and metal filings hung in the air. He looked like a man who hadn't slept in a week.

"Marlow," she said, her voice echoing slightly in the vastness.

He didn't jump. Just turned his head slowly. His face, usually ruddy and cheerful, was the color of old dough. "Elara Vance. Knew you'd come. The gala... that was a hell of a thing." His voice was a gravelly whisper.

Lysander emerged from behind a rack of commercial-grade sauté pans, his movements silent. He'd insisted on coming. "We're past social calls, Marlow. You've been holding the door for the devil. Time to tell us who's in the kitchen."

Marlow's eyes flickered between them, a trapped animal assessing two different kinds of predator. He looked at Elara Vance with a profound, weary shame. "I didn't know about the murders. You have to believe that. I'm a cook, not a... not that."

"Start with the journal," Elara Vance said, keeping her voice low, forcing it to be calm. The smell of the place, the cold, the hum of the machine—it was all pushing in on her. "Aris's journal. You took it from the studio after he died."

A long, shaky breath. "Lysander paid me. A lot. Said he just wanted to see if Aris had written anything about him, about their partnership. Old wounds. I believed him." He shot a venomous glance at Lysander. "He's good at making you believe him."

Lysander's expression didn't change. "I wanted the saffron cure. The real one. I knew Aris had finally cracked it. He was going to change everything."

"And you were going to sell it," Elara Vance stated.

"I was going to use it," Lysander corrected sharply, a flash of the old arrogance returning. "To rebuild what he and I were supposed to have. But Marlow's leaving out the interesting part. Who else was leaning on you?"

Marlow's hands, those skilled, scarred hands that could joint a duck in thirty seconds, trembled. He looked at the spinning sharpening wheel as if hypnotized. "After Aris died... Anton Volkov came to me. He was a mess. Shaking. Said he needed my help with a special menu for a private conglomerate dinner. Big investors. He was vague, but the money was... obscene. Then he started asking questions. About Aris's work. About who else might be close to his techniques."

The pieces began to click into place with a cold, metallic finality. "The conglomerate," Elara Vance breathed. "Savora."

Marlow nodded miserably. "They own the patents on half the synthetic flavorings on the market. They've been buying up rare ingredient brokers, seed banks, farmland. Aris's work—real, perfect, un-patentable flavor replication using natural sources—it was an existential threat. Anton Volkov told me, drunk on fear and expensive vodka, that they'd pressured him. Subtly at first. Then not so subtly. He was to... monitor. Sabotage. Ensure no one in the city's elite culinary circle got too close to Aris's legacy. He spiked a rival's stock with a bittering agent. Swapped another's prized vanilla for a cheap extract. Small things. Then Aris got too close. And Anton Volkov... he was in too deep to say no."

"The poison," Elara Vance said. The image of the tiny, deadly petal floated in her mind. "They gave it to him."

"They ordered it," Marlow corrected. "Through their channels. Anton Volkov was the hand, but they were the will. He was terrified. After he... after Aris, he was a puppet with cut strings. Useless and knowing too much." He finally looked up, his eyes glistening. "I think he wanted to get caught. That's why he was so sloppy with the tuile. He was waiting for someone like you to see it."

The confession hung in the air, thicker than the dust. A cook's confession, full of petty theft and colossal, cowardly silence. Elara Vance felt a surge of nausea that had nothing to do with the smell of oiled steel.

"The journal, Marlow," Lysander pressed, stepping closer. "Where is it? You didn't give it to me. You gave me pages. Copies."

A sly, desperate look crossed Marlow's face. "I kept it. Insurance. It's not here. But I'll give it to you. All of it. There's a place. The old wholesale farmers market at the docks. Before dawn. The vendors will be setting up. Crowds. I'll feel safe."

Elara Vance's instincts screamed. It was too neat, too sudden. "Why there? Why now?"

"Because I'm done!" he burst out, the sound echoing off the copper pots. "I can't look at a knife without seeing... I'll give you the journal. You can do what you want with it. Then I'm leaving this city and this godforsaken business."

Lysander and Elara Vance exchanged a glance. It was a trap. It was so obviously a trap. But the journal was the key. It was the only thing that might contain not just a recipe, but Aris's suspicions, his records of Anton Volkov's strange behavior, perhaps even notes on Savora. They had to walk into it.

"Before dawn," Elara Vance said, her voice leaving no room for negotiation. "We'll be there."

The dockside market was a symphony of controlled chaos under a sky that was just lightening from ink to a bruised purple. Refrigerated trucks exhaled plumes of frosty air that mingled with the scent of damp soil, ripe fruit, and the salty tang of the nearby sea. Towers of wooden crates formed labyrinthine corridors. The air was filled with the shouts of vendors, the rumble of engines, and the creaking of wooden pallets.

As they made their way through the crowded market, Elara Vance's eyes scanned the stalls, searching for any sign of Marlow. She spotted him at the far end of the market, near a stall selling exotic spices. He was huddled in the corner, his eyes fixed on the ground.

Lysander nudged her forward. "Let's get this over with."

Elara Vance approached Marlow cautiously, her senses on high alert. She could feel the weight of the journal in her pocket, a tangible reminder of the secrets it might hold.

"Marlow," she said, her voice low and even. "We're here."

Marlow looked up, his eyes red-rimmed and tired. "I have it," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "The journal. It's in my backpack."

Elara Vance's heart skipped a beat as she reached for the backpack. Her fingers closed around it, and she felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation.

"Let's get out of here," Lysander said, his voice firm.

Elara Vance nodded, her eyes scanning the market one last time. She knew that they were taking a risk, walking into a trap set by Marlow. But she also knew that they had to see this through, to uncover the truth behind Aris's death and the sinister forces that had driven him to it.

As they made their way out of the market, Elara Vance felt a sense of determinationbirthdate of the dark forces that had driven Aris to his death. She knew that they had to be careful, to tread carefully, but she also knew that they had to see this through, to uncover the truth behind the sinister forces that had driven Aris to his death.

The rain had stopped, and the sky was a deep, foreboding grey. Elara Vance felt a shiver run down her spine as she walked out of the market, the journal clutched tightly in her hand. She knew that they were in for a long and difficult journey, but she also knew that they had to see this through, to uncover the truth behind the sinister forces that had driven Aris to his death.
