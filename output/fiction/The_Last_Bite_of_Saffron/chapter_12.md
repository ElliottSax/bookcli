The air in Le Pli’s private dining room was thick enough to slice, a layered consommé of tension. It held the low hum of slow-roasted garlic from the kitchen below, the deep scent of black truffle, and a cold, metallic fear that appeared to seep from the building’s bones. Heavy velvet drapes were drawn against the Parisian dusk, trapping the room under a single ornate lamp. Its crystals cast fractured, trembling rainbows over the polished mahogany, like scattered clues no one could piece together.
Elara Vance stood at the head of the table, her knuckles white where she gripped the back of Aris Thorne’s chair, the carved oak smooth and familiar under her palm. The ghost of his handto rest there with hers. Before her, the suspects sat like figures in a poisonous still-life, each isolated in their own silence: Lysander, his usual smirk gone, his fingers tracing the rim of his untouched water glass. The conglomerate’s lawyer, a man named Croft, sat perfectly still, smelling of sandalwood and the sharp scent of ambition. And Simone, her mentor’s former protégé, who had arrived last, her chef’s jacket a starched white, a single saffron thread caught on her sleeve like a damning brushstroke.
On the table between them were seven plates. Each held a single, flawless arancino, golden and crisp. The comforting smell of saffron and smoked cheese was a warm, beautiful lie.
“Thank you for coming,” Elara said. Her voice was not her own—it was the steady tone Aris Thorne used when explaining a complex emulsion, a voice she pulled up from her grief. “Aris believed truth, like a perfect reduction, needed the right ingredients, the right heat, and time. Tonight,” she went on, her gaze moving over them, “we have all three.”

Croft dabbed his lips with a linen napkin, though he hadn’t eaten. The fabric whispered. “This is a theatrical waste of time. My client’s interests are purely financial, not forensic.”

“Your client’s interests,” Elara cut in, her words sharp as a paring knife, “are the *reason* we’re here. Aris wasn’t killed for a recipe. He was killed for a patent. A process for synthesizing pure, sustainable saffron. Worth billions to a conglomerate that wanted to own flavor itself—to bottle the essence of sunlight and sell it back to the world.”

She saw Simone’s hand twitch, a slight move toward the saffron thread on her sleeve, then the deliberate stillness. A chef’s control.
“Anton Volkov was the broker,” Elara continued, her eyes noting every flinch, every avoided glance.
