Chapter 8: A Feast of Lies

Chapter 8: A Feast of Lies

The Gala of the Golden Plate was a symphony of pretense. The grand ballroom of the historic Pallas Hotel shimmered under the light of a thousand crystal droplets, each refracting the sheen of silk gowns and the cold glint of polished silver. The air was a thick tapestry of scents: the expensive, aquatic chill of oysters on beds of crushed ice; the deep, primal musk of truffles shaved over delicate custards; the high, sweet note of reduced port glazing rows of lamb chops. It was the smell of money and reputation, a perfume Elara had once aspired to breathe as her own.

Now, it choked her.

She stood near a towering ice sculpture of a phoenix, its wings dripping slowly into a basin of Beluga caviar, feeling like a ghost in her own life. Her simple black chef’s jacket was armor amidst the peacocks. She watched Lysander Thorne hold court at the center of the room. He was a portrait of cultivated success, his silver hair catching the light as he laughed, a glass of amber amaro in one hand, gesturing with the other to illustrate some culinary point. Every gesture was a performance. Every smile, a lie.

Aris’s fragmented video diaries played on a loop in her mind. “They want the skeleton, Elara. The framework. They think genius can be inherited, like a watch or a debt.” His face, pixelated and fearful on the tiny screen, had been etched with a paranoia she’d mistaken for artistic temperament. Now, she saw it as prophecy.

Detective Reyes, looking uncomfortable in a stiff suit, stood by the entrance, his eyes scanning the crowd. Their agreement was fragile: she would provoke, he would observe. A controlled burn to smoke out the truth. But the room felt like a tinderbox, and Elara was holding the match.

She took a deep breath, the aroma of saffron-infused risotto alla Milanese from a passing waiter momentarily disorienting her. It was Aris’s signature touch—a whisper of cardamom under the saffron, a hidden complexity. Seeing it here, on Lysander’s menu, was the final goad.

She moved. The crowd seemed to part, not out of respect, but from the sheer force of her intent. Conversations hushed in her wake, leaving a trail of silence. She stopped before Lysander, the circle of admirers around him melting away.

“Lysander.”

His smile didn’t falter, but it cooled, like a sauce forming a skin. “Elara. I’m surprised to see you here. I heard you were… keeping simpler hours these days.”

“I’m here for Aris,” she said, her voice clear, carrying. Reyes shifted his weight by the door.

“A tragic loss,” Lysander sighed, a practiced grief. “We all mourn him. His spirit is in every dish tonight.”

“His spirit isn’t in the dishes,” Elara said, her voice rising. “His work is. Stolen. You didn’t just inherit his restaurant. You inherited his last, great project. The one he was terrified someone would take. The one you killed him for.”

A gasp rippled through the immediate crowd. Forks hovered. A champagne flute clinked nervously.
