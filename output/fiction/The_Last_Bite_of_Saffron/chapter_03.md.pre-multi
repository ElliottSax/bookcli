Chapter 3: Supper Club Underground

The address led Elara to a part of the city that smelled of damp river stone and diesel. It was a converted warehouse district, now home to minimalist galleries and overpriced lofts, but the building she stood before was stubbornly industrial. A faded sign read ‘Avernus Wine Importers.’ The only light came from a single, fly-specked bulb above a steel door.

Her invitation, a card of heavy, cream-colored stock embossed with a simple door knocker, felt like a lead weight in her clutch. She’d spent two hours transforming herself from food truck operator into someone who belonged in the whispered-about Cellar Door. The black sheath dress was borrowed, a relic from her sommelier days. It felt like someone else’s skin. She’d pinned her auburn hair up, applied a slash of crimson lipstick she never wore, and felt like a forgery. But a forgery, she hoped, with a sharp enough palate to detect the truth.

A camera lens, a glinting black eye, was mounted beside the door. She held the card up to it. A moment of silent judgment passed before a heavy clunk echoed from within, and the door swung inward on silent hinges.

A man in a tailored suit, built like a retired boxer, nodded her inside. “Welcome. The elevator, please.” His voice was gravel in a velvet bag. The interior was a cavern of stacked wine crates, the air cool and fragrant with the scent of oak and dust. He led her to a freight elevator at the rear, its cage door open like a waiting mouth. “Down,” was all he said.

The descent was slow, the machinery groaning. The light from above shrank to a yellow square, then vanished. For a long moment, there was only darkness and the smell of cold earth. Then, a soft, golden glow began to rise from below. The elevator settled with a sigh.

The cage opened onto opulence.

It was a dining room carved from a dream of old-world decadence. The walls were rough-hewn stone, hung with tapestries depicting medieval feasts. A long, reclaimed oak table, polished to a deep gleam, dominated the space, set for twelve with mismatched antique china and heavy silver. Crystal decanters caught the light from a constellation of wrought-iron chandeliers, their candles making the shadows dance. The air was a complex bouquet: beeswax, woodsmoke, and beneath it all, the thrilling, elusive scent of something exquisite about to be born in fire.

A murmur of conversation, low and self-assured, came from the other guests. They were a curated collection: a silver-haired man with the watchful eyes of a collector, a woman in architectural silk who fingered her pearls as if counting secrets, a young tech-bro type trying too hard to look bored. Elara’s entrance drew glances—assessments of a new variable. She offered a tight, polite smile and took the only empty seat, midway down the table.

Before she could even place her napkin, a voice, smooth and deep as a cello note, flowed from an arched doorway leading to what must be the kitchen.

“A gathering of seekers. Welcome.”

He emerged, and the room’s energy shifted, bending toward him like plants to a sun. Chef Lysander was tall, with the lean, tensile strength of a whip. His dark hair was swept back, silver threading the temples. He wore a chef’s jacket of impeccable black linen, unbuttoned at the throat. His eyes were the most striking feature: a pale, piercing gray, the color of winter sea fog. They swept the table, missing nothing.

“We dine tonight not to fill a void, but to expand one,” he began, moving slowly along the periphery. “Food is not sustenance. It is alchemy. It is memory and desire given form. It is the only magic left to those of us who have outgrown fairy tales.” His voice was hypnotic, each word deliberate. “You have come to the Cellar Door because you understand that the most profound experiences are found not in the light, but in the shadows. In the between places.”

He paused directly behind Elara’s chair. She could feel the heat of his presence, smell the clean scent of lemon verbena and knife steel on him. She kept her gaze fixed on her water glass, its surface trembling slightly.

“Tonight’s journey will be eight courses. A narrative. I ask only that you surrender to it.” With that, he turned and disappeared back into the kitchen. A collective, almost imperceptible sigh went through the guests. The performance had begun.

The first courses arrived: an oyster with a granita of sea buckthorn and woodruff that tasted like the breath of a cold ocean; a translucent slice of lardo draped over a warm brick of sourdough that melted into sinful, salty richness. Elara ate, her critic’s mind cataloging every note, every technique. It was brilliant, arrogant cooking. It was also, she noted with a chill, stylistically fluid. It borrowed from Nordic austerity, Japanese precision, and French luxury without committing to any. It was the cooking of a brilliant mimic.

Between the third course—a pillow of sweetbreads with morels and a sauce that was pure, dark umami—and the fourth, she excused herself to find the restroom. A discreet waiter pointed her down a short, dim corridor lined with wine racks. As she passed the open kitchen door, its window a square of intense light and movement, she glanced in.

The kitchen was a study in controlled chaos. Lysander moved at its center, a conductor. And there, at the passe, searing scallops with a furious focus, was a face she knew. A face from a past life.

Marlow.

His blond hair was shorter, his jaw tighter, but the permanent sneer of discontent was the same. Marlow had been a line cook at Le Jardin, the three-Michelin-starred temple where she and Aris had ruled. Brilliant, volatile, and perpetually convinced the world owed him a crown. He’d clashed with Aris constantly, his ambition a raw, ugly thing. He’d left in a blaze of fury after Aris passed him over for a sous-chef promotion, hurling a plate of consommé at the wall and vowing they’d regret it.

And now he was here, in this secret kitchen, working for a man who spoke of alchemy. Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs. She ducked back into the shadows before he could look up.

When she returned to the table, the fourth course was being cleared. The silver-haired man, whose name was Edmund, was holding court. “...of course, Volkov knew where all the bodies were buried. Literally, one might say, after last week.” A tense, conspiratorial chuckle rippled around him.

The woman in silk, introduced as Celia, leaned forward, her voice a venomous whisper. “He didn’t just know where they were buried, darling. He helped put them there. For a price. A favorable review in exchange for silence? A small fee to forget a… sourcing irregularity? He had a palate for secrets as refined as his palate for truffles.”

“A dangerous game,” murmured the tech-bro. “Chefs are a passionate breed.”

“Precisely,” Edmund said, swirling his Burgundy. “And passion, when cornered, seeks an outlet. I heard he’d been making new demands. More… personal ones. Beyond the usual kickbacks.”

Elara’s blood ran cold. She kept her expression neutral, taking a slow sip of wine. Blackmail. It was the confirmation she’d been hunting for, served up with the casual cruelty of after-dinner gossip. Anton hadn’t just been a critic; he’d been a predator. And predators make enemies.

The fifth course arrived, pulling the table’s attention back. It was a masterpiece of deception: a perfect, glistening sphere that looked like an egg yolk. The server instructed them to place it whole in their mouths. It burst, flooding the senses with the intense, sunny flavor of passionfruit and saffron, bound by a delicate membrane of white chocolate. It was stunning. It was also, Elara noted with a jolt, a direct homage to a famous Ferran Adrià dish. Lysander was not just a mimic; he was a magpie, collecting shiny techniques.

The meal progressed, a relentless parade of ingenuity. Elara’s mind raced, connecting threads. Marlow’s presence, Lysander’s borrowed brilliance, the gossip about Anton’s blackmail—it all swirled together like the components of a sauce reducing over a flame, thickening toward a single, unsettling truth.
