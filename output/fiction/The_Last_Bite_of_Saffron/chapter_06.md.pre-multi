Chapter 6: The Mentor's Legacy

Chapter 6: The Mentor’s Legacy

The rain had settled into a persistent, whispering drizzle against Elara’s apartment windows, turning the city’s lights into smears of gold and neon. Inside, the only illumination came from her laptop screen, casting a sickly blue pallor over the clutter of her desk: empty espresso cups, a half-eaten pain au chocolat that now tasted of ashes, and the unassuming silver USB drive.

It felt heavier than any ingredient she’d ever lifted.

She inserted it, the click echoing in the quiet. A folder appeared, labelled simply ‘A.’ Inside, a series of files with timestamps stretching back over a year. The earliest was dated just eight months before his death.

Her finger hovered over the trackpad. This was it. Not second-hand stories, not crime scene photos, but Aris himself. The man, not the myth. She took a breath that did nothing to steady her, and pressed play.

The video filled the screen. It was the back office of Krokos, Aris’s restaurant. Not the sleek, minimalist space presented to the public, but the chef’s true sanctum: walls lined with crammed bookshelves, spice jars holding unlabelled treasures, a faded poster of a Sifnos coastline. And there he was.

Aris Thasos was in his late fifties, but on screen, he looked both younger and older simultaneously. His hair, more pepper than salt in this earlier video, was rumpled. He wore a simple black t-shirt, a faint stain of what might have been red wine or pomegranate molasses near the collar. He was leaning towards the webcam, his eyes alight with a fervour Elara remembered like a physical ache.

“Day… whatever,” he began, his voice a warm, gravelly baritone that sent a lance of grief through her. “The concept is solidifying. Not a dish. A narrative. A progression that tells the story of saffron not as a mere spice, but as a cultural phantom. From the purple crocus breaking through cold earth, to the stigma’s sacrifice, to the golden infusion… to the memory of it. The ghost of flavour on the palate after the last bite.”

He spoke with his hands, sketching shapes in the air. “I’m calling it Saffron Symphony. A nine-part tasting menu. Each movement a different extraction method, a different partner. Not just risotto or bouillabaisse. I’m using it in a foie gras torchon, frozen into a dust for a scallop crudo, distilled into an agar sphere that bursts with sunset…” He trailed off, rubbing his eyes. “But it’s more than the food. It’s the key. The key to everything.”

The video jumped. A later timestamp. Aris looked more tired. The office was darker, a single desk lamp pooling light around him. The fervour was still there, but edged with something else.

“They’re circling,” he said, his voice lower. “The Culinary Circle. A pathetic name for a pathetic group of gatekeepers. They don’t create. They curate. They acquire. And if they can’t acquire, they intimidate.” He picked up a saffron thread from his desk, holding it up to the light. “They want control. Over trends, over ingredients, over chefs. They fund the critics who make or break you, own the suppliers of the ‘it’ ingredient of the season. They present it as patronage, as ‘preserving tradition.’ It’s a gilded cage. They tried to recruit me years ago. I laughed. I think they’ve stopped laughing.”

Another file. His face was drawn. “The Symphony is nearly complete. The recipes, the techniques… it’s all here.” He tapped his temple. “And here.” He gestured to a small, battered notebook on the desk. “But it needs a final movement. The resolution. The ‘Last Bite.’ It eludes me. And I feel… watched. My sous is asking too many questions. Always in the right place, a little too eager. A protégé who turned viper.” His jaw tightened. The pain in his eyes was not fear, but profound betrayal. He did not say the name.

Elara’s blood ran cold. Sous chef. Leo had been Aris’s sous before he left to launch his own meteoric career. Leo, with his charming smile and ruthless ambition. Leo, her ex, who knew every inch of her own history with Aris. The connection she’d sensed at The Cellar Door tightened, a noose made of memory.

The next video was fragmented, corrupted. Glitches of Aris’s face, words cutting in and out: “…safe deposit box… First Hellenic Bank… key is with… not for the Circle… my true masterpiece… the Symphony is just the score…”

Then, the final file. The timestamp was the night he died.

The quality was worse, grainier. Aris was in the main kitchen of Krokos, after hours. The stainless steel counters gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights. He looked gaunt, haunted. He was speaking directly into his phone, the camera jittery.

“I’ve done it,” he whispered, though there was no triumph in his voice. “The Last Bite. It came to me tonight. It’s so simple. Devastatingly simple. The ghost of the saffron, but presented as… an absence. A void that tastes of memory.” He ran a hand through his hair, which was now stark white. “But I was right. The Symphony is the key, but also the poison. To know it is to have a target on your back. It proves what they can’t control exists. It’s…”

He froze. The phone camera dipped, showing a blur of his shoes on the checkered floor. He had heard something.

A noise. Not from the video’s tinny speaker, but from the restaurant’s kitchen. A soft, almost imperceptible click. A door closing? A cooler humming to life?

Aris’s breath hitched. The camera lifted. His face filled the frame, every line etched with a sudden, chilling clarity. It wasn’t just paranoia. It was recognition. He wasn’t surprised by the presence of another; he seemed to recognize the specificity of the intrusion. His eyes darted towards the kitchen’s service entrance, visible in the dark background.

“You,” he breathed, the word not a question but a weary statement. “I should have known you’d come for it yourself.”

There was a shadow then, a distortion of light at the edge of the frame, elongated and wavering on the stainless steel. Not a full form, just a suggestion of movement. Aris took a step back, not in fear, but in a kind of resigned defiance. He opened his mouth to speak again.

The video cut to black.

Not with a click. Not with an ending. It was severed. A guillotine drop of silence.

Elara sat motionless. The only sound was the rain and the frantic hammering of her own heart against her ribs. The ghost of the image was seared onto her vision: Aris’s face in that final moment. He hadn’t been afraid of a thief. He’d been confronting someone he knew. Someone he’d once trusted.

Protégé who turned viper.

The list from the health inspector burned in her mind. Leo’s name was there. Simone’s too. Both had been at The Cellar Door. Both had been in Aris’s orbit. Both had motive—the ultimate career-making masterpiece. Leo had the ambition. Simone, after their bitter falling out, had a resentment towards Elara that could easily have bled into a jealousy of her connection to Aris.

But the shadow in the video… it was just a shadow. It could have been anyone.

Her phone buzzed, shattering the silence. An unknown number. She answered, her voice a dry croak.

“Elara Finch?” A man’s voice, tight with anxiety.

“Yes?”

“It’s Ben. Ben from The Cellar Door. The, uh, the other night? You gave me your card.” He sounded like he was speaking through clenched teeth.

“I remember. What’s wrong?”

“I think someone’s been in my flat. Nothing’s gone. But… my notebook. The one I use for tasting notes. It was on my desk. Now it’s in a drawer. And the pages from the night of the… the dinner at Krokos… they’re gone. Torn out.”

Elara’s grip tightened on the phone. “Did you see anyone?”

“No. But…” He lowered his voice to a whisper. “After you left, Chef Lysander asked me a lot of questions. About who I’d spoken to. He was very… insistent. He has this way of looking at you. Like he’s tasting you and finding you bland.”

Lysander. The enigmatic host, the collector of secrets, the man with a past connection to Aris she hadn’t yet untangled. A man who could move through a room like a shadow.

“Ben, you need to be careful.”

“You think?” he hissed, panic breaking through. “Whoever killed Aris Thasos was at that dinner. And now they know I might have seen something, or written something down. I’m a sommelier, not a detective!”

“Meet me,” Elara said, the decision crystallizing. “Tomorrow. Somewhere public. The food market at Borough, by the spice stall at noon. We’ll figure this out.”

After a long pause, he agreed and hung up.

Elara stared at the black laptop screen, seeing only Aris’s final, resigned expression. The culinary world was her world. Its language of flavour and technique was her native tongue. But now, that language was being used to write a threat. The Saffron Symphony was out there, a holy grail and a death sentence. The key was in a safe deposit box. And the viper was in the grass, someone who moved through kitchens with the same silent grace as Aris himself, someone who could approach him in his own sanctuary and be met not with a shout, but with a weary, “You.”

She needed the key. She needed to find that box. And she needed to look into the eyes of the people from her past—Leo with his starched whites and simmering arrogance, Simone with her sugar-fine resentment, Lysander with his curated mystery—and see if she could spot the shadow from the video lurking behind them.

The rain intensified, drumming a frantic rhythm against the glass. Somewhere out there, under the same weeping sky, the killer was preserving a legacy they had stolen, using the most delicate spice in the world to cover a scent that was, to Elara, suddenly unmistakable: the metallic, coppery tang of blood.
