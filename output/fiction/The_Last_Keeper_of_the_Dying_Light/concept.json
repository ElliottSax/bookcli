  "genre": "literary",
  "subgenre": "magical realism",
  "premise": "In a world where a person's shadow begins to fade six months before their death, Elara makes her living as a 'Lux Tailor,' stitching borrowed light into the thinning silhouettes of the terminally ill to grant them a final, vibrant season. Her own shadow, however, has been gone for years, a secret she guards fiercely until she is hired by a man whose shadow is not fading, but actively rewriting itself into monstrous, prophetic shapes. To save him, she must journey into the forgotten, lightless hinterlands of her own past, where the source of all human shadows\u2014and the true cost of her borrowed time\u2014awaits.",
  "protagonist": "Elara Vance, a weary, pragmatic artisan who trades in a metaphysical currency she herself has run out of.",
  "conflict": "Elara must confront the hidden origin of her own shadowless state and the ecological catastrophe she unwittingly enabled, all while racing against the corruption of her client's prophetic shadow, which foretells a world plunged into permanent, meaningless light.",
  "setting": "A near-future, slightly decayed coastal city and the surreal, light-starved 'Umbra Wastes' beyond its borders, where physical and metaphysical geography blur.",
  "tone": "Melancholic, luminous, and quietly eerie; a story of intimate grief set against a backdrop of vast, poetic decay."
