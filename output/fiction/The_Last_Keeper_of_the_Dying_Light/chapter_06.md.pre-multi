Chapter 6: Echoes in the Dark

Chapter 6: Echoes in the Dark

The border was not a line, but a breath held too long and then released into silence. One moment, the world was a study in muted greys and dying ochres, the light thin and sour but present. The next, Elara stepped through an unseen membrane, and all external light was extinguished. It did not fade; it was swallowed. The effect was so absolute it felt less like entering darkness and more like being plunged into the depths of a cold, starless sea.

Her own lantern, the one Alistair had insisted she take—its casing etched with runes of containment—became not just a tool, but a sovereign territory. Its glow, which in the outer wastes had been a humble companion, now asserted itself as a tiny, defiant kingdom. It pushed back the void for a radius of perhaps ten feet, painting the ground beneath her boots in shaky strokes of amber. Beyond that, the blackness was not an absence, but a substance. It pressed against the light’s edge, patient and viscous.

The air changed. It lost the mineral tang of the wastes and grew still and close, carrying a scent she could not place—old paper, damp wool, and beneath it, the faint, sweet rot of forgotten flowers. Sound died here, too. Her footsteps, which should have crunched on the barren ground, made no noise. Her own breathing was loud in her ears, a ragged tide. She was a bubble of sensation adrift in a perfect sensory void.

She walked for what felt like hours, though time had shed its skin. The compass was useless, its needle spinning in lazy, drunken circles. She navigated by the pounding of her heart, by the simple, terrible need to move forward. The lantern’s light bobbed, a luminous prow cutting through the dark sea.

And then, the dark began to give back.

It started with a smell. A sudden, piercing ribbon of lilac and vanilla—her mother’s perfume. The scent was so vivid, so violently specific, that Elara gasped and stopped, her hand flying to her chest as if wounded. It was there for three heartbeats, a ghost in her nostrils, and then it was gone, leaving behind only the old-paper smell and a longing so acute it felt like a dislocation.

She took another step, and the light from her lantern fell upon something that should not have been. A porch swing, its wood painted a flaking white, one chain slightly rusted. It hung from nothing, suspended in the void. As the light touched it, it began to move with a soft, familiar creak—erk-tch, erk-tch—the sound of a thousand summer evenings. She could see the indentations on the seat cushion. She could almost feel the ghost of the warm wood beneath her childhood thighs. She reached a trembling hand out, and her fingers passed through the armrest. The vision shivered, like a reflection in a pond struck by a stone, and dissolved into swirling motes of shadow that bled back into the greater dark.

“An echo,” she whispered, the first words she had spoken since entering. Her voice was small, consumed by the silence.

The Hinterlands were not a geography. Alistair’s maps, his careful calculations, they were the logic of a world that did not apply here. This was a psychology. A gallery of loss. She understood it now, not with her mind, but with the marrow of her bones. This was where shadows went when they were severed, when their owners died or forgot them. And shadows were not just silhouettes; they were impressions, the negatives of moments, the emotional residue left on the fabric of the world. They pooled here, in this state of being, this repository for all that had slipped away.

The understanding was a cold weight in her stomach. Her own shadow, fraying at her heels, twitched in sympathy.

She moved on, the phantom sensations coming more frequently. The cool smoothness of a specific river stone. The taste of her father’s bitter black tea, stolen from his cup. The texture of her nursery wallpaper, raised velvet roses under her small fingertips. Each memory was a flare of exquisite pain, illuminating a corridor of her past she had worked for decades to wall off. They were not welcome visits. They were ambushes.

Then, she saw the first figure.

It stood at the very limit of her lantern’s reach, where the light frayed into darkness. A human shape, but wrought entirely from a blackness deeper than the surrounding void. It had no face, no features, only a suggestion of a head, shoulders, a stance. It was silent and utterly still. It did not feel hostile. It felt observant. Empty.

An Echo.

Her breath hitched. She took a cautious step forward, raising the lantern. The figure did not retreat, but as the light washed over it, its form shifted, blurred, and for a fleeting second, it seemed to wear the long coat and broad-brimmed hat of her grandfather. Then the light settled, and it was just a shadow-man again. When she lowered the lantern, it was gone.

But it was not alone.

As she ventured deeper, they appeared more often. Silent sentinels at the edges of her perception. A cluster of them, shorter, like children, playing a soundless, motionless game. A taller pair, standing close, their shadow-forms leaning towards one another in a parody of intimacy. They never approached. They never made a sound. They only watched, and in their watching, they pulled the memories from her like splinters.

She saw her mother’s shadow-Echo by a phantom kitchen window, looking out at nothing. She saw her father’s, bent over a ghostly workbench. Each one was a nail hammered into the coffin of her former life. She wanted to scream at them, to demand they leave her, but her voice was a prisoner in her throat. Their silence was more terrible than any accusation.

The path—though there was no path—began to slope downward. The ground underfoot became softer, giving, like ash. The bubble of her light was the only reality. The Echoes multiplied. They were no longer just at the periphery; they were all around her, a silent, dark audience to her pilgrimage. She could feel their hollow attention, a pressure against her skin. She kept her eyes fixed ahead, on the nothingness, clutching the lantern until the metal bit into her palm.

A new smell cut through the others: ozone and burnt sugar, the scent of the day her world ended. The day the Light, in its wild, dying spasm, had scorched her home from the world and her family from existence. Panic, hot and metallic, flooded her mouth. She broke into a run, a futile, silent sprint through the ash, the lantern jolting wildly, casting frantic, leaping shapes that made the Echoes seem to sway and reach.

She stumbled, falling to her knees. The ash puffed up in soundless clouds. She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to block it out, but the darkness behind her eyelids was just as fertile. She saw the blinding flash, felt the heat on her face, heard the silence that followed the roar—a silence so complete it had echoed inside her for thirty years.

When she opened her eyes, gasping, she was no longer surrounded by a crowd.

One Echo stood directly before her, ten feet away.

It was smaller than the others. Slight. Its form was clearer, more defined. As Elara watched, frozen on her knees, it solidified further. Details emerged from the shadow-stuff: the messy cascade of hair she had worn as a girl, the too-big tunic that had been her favorite, the scab on one knee. The Echo of her younger self did not have a face, but its head was tilted with a curiosity that was achingly familiar.

Elara’s heart shattered quietly, like glass under a blanket.

The child-Echo took a step forward. Then another. It moved with a lightness the others lacked, a mimicry of life. It stopped at the edge of the lantern light, just outside its golden pool. It stood in the penumbra, half in shadow, half in deeper shadow.

Then, it raised its arm. A small, pale hand—not shadow, but a memory made momentarily tangible—emerged from the sleeve. In its hand, it held a single, burning candle. The flame was a perfect, motionless teardrop of white light.

The little Echo looked from its candle to Elara’s lantern. It pointed a finger, not at the light, but at Elara’s heart.

The gesture was not a question. It was an indictment. You carry the light. You are the keeper. Where were you?

A sob tore itself from Elara’s throat, a raw, ugly sound in the perfect silence. “I couldn’t,” she rasped, her voice breaking. “I was just a girl. I couldn’t save it. I couldn’t save you.”

The younger Elara lowered its hand. For a moment, it simply stood there, a monument to innocence and loss. Then it turned and looked back into the absolute blackness from which it had come. It looked back once more at the woman kneeling in the ash, the keeper of a dying light, the survivor.

It blew out its candle.

The tiny flame vanished, and with it, the last semblance of the child’s tangible form. It melted back into a simple, dark Echo. Then it turned and ran, not with the silence of the others, but with the phantom pad-pad-pad of small, bare feet on a wooden floor—a sound from a sunlit house that no longer existed. It sprinted into the waiting darkness, and was gone.

Elara was left alone in the circle of her lantern’s light, the echo of those ghostly footsteps the only sound in the universe. The ash on her knees was cold. The hollow eyes of a hundred other lost shadows watched from the void, waiting.

She had come to find the source of shadows. She had found, instead, the wellspring of her own grief. And at its center, a version of herself that had never stopped running into the dark, waiting for a light that had failed to follow.

The lantern’s flame guttered, just once.

In the sudden, deeper gloom, she saw something new. Far ahead, where the little Echo had fled, the absolute blackness was no longer uniform. A faint, greyish luminescence seeped from a point in the distance, like the first hint of dawn behind a mountain. It was not a friendly light. It was a sickly, magnetic glow, and it pulsed with a slow, rhythmic throb that she felt in her teeth.

It was the heart of the Hinterlands. And it was calling.
