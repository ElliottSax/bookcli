a great, silent circle around the pond, their faces turned toward her with an unnerving, unblinking intensity. Some of them wore the same kind of rags as the drifter, while others were dressed in a strange, mismatched assortment of clothing that appeared to have been salvaged from a dozen different eras. They did not move, did not speak, but instead regarded her with a collective, unyielding stare that made her skin crawl.
As she stood there, frozen in uncertainty, a figure emerged from the circle. It was a woman, tall and gaunt, with eyes thato burn with an inner fire. She wore a long, flowing cloak that was a deep, rich brown, and her hair was a wild tangle of black locks that seemed appeared to and twist like living vines.
"Welcome, traveler," the woman said, her voice low and husky. "We have been waiting for you."

Elara shiver run down her spine as the woman's eyes seeme into her very soul. "Waiting for me?" she repeated, trying to keep her voice steady.
The woman nodded, her gaze never wavering. "Yes. We have been waiting for one with a sharp shadow. And you, traveler, have a shadow that is indeed sharp."

Elara surge of unease as the woman's words seemed to echoappeared toter's earlier statement. "What do you mean?" she asked, trying to keep her voice neutral.
The woman smiled, a cold, mirthless smile. "We mean that you have a shadow that is not like the others. It is strong, it is clear, and it is... hungry."

Elara's heart skipped a beat as the woman's words seemed to stord deep within her. "Hungry?" she repeated, trying to keep her voice steady.
The woman nodded again. "Yes. Your shadow is hungry. And it will only be satisfied when it has consumed all that is around it."

Elara chill run down her spine as the woman's words seemed to paint a picappeared to dark, foreboding future. "What do you want from me?" she asked, trying to keep her voice firm.
The woman's smile grew wider, her eyes glinting with a malevolent light. "We want to show you the true nature of your shadow," she said. "We want to show you what it is capable of."

As she spoke, the woman raised her hand, and the air around Elara seemed to ripple an. The shadows around her move, to twist and writhe like living things. And Elara feelings of horror growing within her,hints off dread that seemed to consume her very sappeared to woman's words seemed to echo in her mindand foreboding prophecy. "Your shadow is hungry. And it will only be satisfied when it has consumed all that is around it."

As the shadows closed in around her, Elara knew that she was in grave danger. She knew that she had to escape, to flee from the village and the woman's dark, foreboding prophecy. But as she turned to run, she strange, creeping sensation in her mind, abeing drawn back into the village, back into the woman's clutches.
And then, everything went black.
When Elara came to, she was lying on the ground, her head throbbing with pain. The village was quiet, the people gone. But as she sat up, she saw that the woman was standing over her, a look of cold, calculating interest on her face.
"You have seen the true nature of your shadow," the woman replied, her voice low and husky. "And now, you must make a choice. You must choose to surrender to its power, or to resist it."

Elara surge of fear as the woman's words seemed to paint a picture of a darkappeared toing future. She knew that she had to make a choice, but she was not sure what the consequences would be.
As she looked up at the woman, she saw that her eyes was burning with an innend in that moment, Elara knew that she was in grave danger. She knew that she had to escape, to flee from the village and the woman's dark, foreboding prophecy.
