Chapter 1: The Fading Parlor

Chapter 1: The Fading Parlor

The light in the room was not what one would call illumination. It was a substance, thick and golden as honey, pooled in the center of the floor where the late afternoon sun fell through the high, round window. Elara moved through it like a wader through a slow stream, feeling its warmth cling to the hem of her grey wool dress. Around the edges of the room, in the corners where the light did not deign to reach, the shadows were not mere absences. They were presences. Dense, velvet, and patient.

Mrs. Althea Finch was one such shadow, dissolving.

She sat in the high-backed chair, a vessel of parchment skin and bird-bone, her own shadow stretched thin and pale on the floorboards behind her. It was the color of weak tea, its edges fraying like old lace. Elara did not need to measure it with her calibrated brass rods to know it was in its final attenuation. A week, perhaps two, before it would simply cease to adhere to the woman. The body would follow, shortly and without fuss, as it always did.

“It tickles, you know,” Mrs. Finch said, her voice a dry leaf skittering on stone. “The fading. Not unpleasantly. Like… like dandelion fluff brushing the inside of your wrists.”

Elara offered a small, professional smile. She did not say that she wouldn’t know. She arranged her tools on the low rosewood table: the silver needle, fine as a spider’s leg; the spool of thread spun from virgin flax and moon-dusted silk; the crystal phials, each stoppered with wax and cork. Inside them, captured light shifted restlessly. One held the essence of a perfect, cloudless noon from the previous Midsummer—a dense, vibrant gold. Another glowed with the softer, peach-toned light of an autumn bonfire. The smallest phial pulsed with a cool, greenish-silver: the collective gleam of a hundred fireflies, harvested from the marsh on a still June night.

“We will use the firefly light today, Mrs. Finch,” Elara said, her voice low and smooth. “The noon sun would be too harsh. It would burn through what remains. The firefly is gentle. It remembers the dark.”

“I always liked fireflies,” the old woman murmured, her eyes fixed on the pulsing phial. “My Henry used to catch them for me in a jar. I’d make him let them go before bed.” A sigh escaped her, so faint it barely stirred the dust motes dancing in the honey-light. “He’s been gone twenty years. His shadow went first. I think it hurried ahead, to make a place for mine.”

Elara’s hands, steady and pale, did not falter. She poured a measure of distilled twilight—a neutral base—into a mother-of-pearl dish. With a pipette, she drew a single drop of the firefly essence. It fell into the twilight like a green star into a violet sea, spreading in a luminous, intricate bloom. She dipped the tip of her thread into the mixture, whispering the old, soft words of binding. The thread drank the light, glowing from within.

The work was embroidery of the most intimate kind. Elara knelt on the floor beside Mrs. Finch’s chair, her own body carefully angled so that the direct sun fell on her back, not her feet. She took the silver needle, now thrumming with a faint, verdant hum, and began.

She did not touch the woman’s body. She touched her shadow.

The needle slipped into the tenuous grey film on the floorboards as if into water. There was a slight resistance, a texture like cobweb and cold smoke. Mrs. Finch gasped, a small, sharp intake. “Oh. That is… more than a tickle.”

“Breathe with the rhythm,” Elara instructed, her focus absolute. “In as I pull the thread through. Out as I set the next stitch.”

In, out. The needle dove and rose, trailing its thread of captured moonlight and insect gleam. Each stitch was a tiny anchor, a knot of borrowed luminosity. Elara worked along the fading outline of the shadow-head, reinforcing the corona, then down the slender arm, where the shadow was almost transparent. She stitched a delicate filigree along the edge, a pattern reminiscent of climbing ivy or neural pathways. It was not about creating something new, but about reminding the shadow what it was—a companion, a definition, a proof of being under light.

As she worked, the room changed. The dense gold of the sunbeam seemed to thin, as if some of its vitality was being subtly siphoned into Elara’s work. The green glow from her needle reflected in the dust, in the glass of her phials, in the wide, watching eyes of Mrs. Finch. A scent rose, not unpleasant: ozone, crushed nettle, and the faint, sweet decay of autumn leaves.

Elara was aware, as she always was, of the empty space at her own heels. The place where a shadow should pool, connecting her to the floor, to the light, to the world. She kept her knees tucked, her posture such that her form bled into the deeper gloom of the room’s corner. In her profession, it was the ultimate taboo. The keeper of shadows, herself shadowless. A void mending voids. If a client were to see… but none ever did. Her reputation—the reclusive, gentle-voiced woman in the cottage at the edge of the whispering wood—remained untarnished.

“I feel… a warmth,” Mrs. Finch whispered. Her voice had lost its papery dryness. It was still old, but now it was old like seasoned wood, not dead ash. “In my feet. I haven’t felt my feet in months.”

Elara did not look up. “The shadow is the root. When it strengthens, the feeling returns.”

She finished the final stitch at the tip of the shadow’s foot, tying off the thread with a minute, complex knot. She snipped it with silver shears. The glow in the thread faded, absorbed. For a moment, nothing happened.

Then, Mrs. Finch’s shadow deepened. The weak tea became strong amber. Its edges grew sharp, definitive against the warm pine of the floorboards. It was no longer a ghost of her; it was her silhouette, crisp and confident.

The woman in the chair straightened. Color, faint but real, bloomed on her cheeks—the echo of the green-gold light now sewn into her essence. She lifted a hand, marveling at the visible strength in the tendons, the slight flush under the liver spots. A tear traced a path through the powder on her wrinkled cheek.

“It’s a miracle,” she breathed.

Elara sat back on her heels, a familiar hollow opening in her chest. “It is a loan, Mrs. Finch. The firefly light is gentle, but it is also ephemeral. It will hold for a time. A month, perhaps six weeks. It will… make things clearer. Brighter. It will give you time.”

“Time for what?” The old woman’s gaze was lucid, painfully so.

“To say the things that need saying. To feel the sun on your face without the veil of fading. To remember the fireflies.”

The lucidity turned to a profound, quiet sorrow. The bittersweet victory. They always cried at this part, when the vitality returned and with it, the full, un-numbed understanding of what had been lost, and what was still to be lost. Elara busied herself with cleaning her needle, placing the phials back in their velvet-lined case. She accepted the payment—a small pouch of silver coins and, as agreed, a locket containing a curl of hair from Mrs. Finch’s long-dead Henry. Payment was always part coin, part personal resonance. The resonance fed the work, in ways Elara did not fully understand but deeply respected.

She helped Mrs. Finch to the door. The woman walked out into the cobbled lane not with a skip, but with a solid, grounded step. Her shadow, robust and green-tinged, danced faithfully beside her. Elara watched from the doorway, her own form a stark cut-out against the dim interior. She waited until the client turned the corner, then retreated, closing the heavy oak door on the dying day.

The cottage was her sanctuary and her cage. It was a place of perpetual, curated twilight. Thick curtains hung at all windows, adjustable to admit only specific angles and qualities of light. Books on optics, philosophy, and forgotten metaphysics lined the walls. Drying herbs hung from the beams, not for cooking, but for their influence on luminance: sage to cleanse, mugwort to attract moonbeams, saffron to bind sunlight. In the center of the main room stood her worktable, a landscape of delicate instruments—prisms, light-traps, spectral lenses, and jars of pigments ground from rare stones that only held color in certain kinds of dark.

She moved to the cold hearth. Here, the darkness was deepest. She stood for a long moment, then turned to face the last grey light from the window. She looked down.

Nothing. Where her feet met the worn rug, there was only floor. The light hit her, passed through her as if she were a pane of the clearest glass, and painted the wall behind her. She was a woman without an echo. She had been this way for as long as she could remember. Her earliest memory was not of a face, but of the confused stare of a kitten, batting at the space behind her where a playmate should have been. The cottage, her work, her meticulous isolation—it was all an elaborate dance around this central, silent fact.

She was about to light the oil lamps—their soft, directional glow was safe—when a sound came at the door. Not a knock, but a swift, sure scrape, as of something being slipped underneath.

Elara froze. Clients never came unannounced. The commission for Mrs. Finch had been arranged weeks ago via a discreet town intermediary. She waited, listening to the retreating crunch of footsteps on gravel—fast, light, urgent. Only when silence returned did she pad to the door and kneel.

A rectangle of thick, cream-colored parchment lay on the floor. It was sealed not with wax, but with a wafer of something dark and resinous that smelled of pine and deep earth. Her name was written on the front in a sharp, angular hand: Elara of the Fading Parlor.

Frowning, she broke the seal. Inside was a single sheet of the same expensive paper. The message was brief, devoid of salutation or pleasantry.

Your skills are required for a unique and dire condition. The subject is not fading, but… transformed. The affliction is aggressive. Time is measured in days, not weeks. Come to the Old Watchman’s Lodge at the heart of the Whispering Wood. Discretion is paramount. The fee offered is triple your usual rate, payable in the currency of your choice.

It was signed with a single, looping initial that could have been an ‘R’ or a ‘V’.

Elara’s breath caught. Triple her rate. It was an obscene amount, enough to secure her quiet life for years. But it was the phrases that snagged in her mind like thorns. Not fading, but transformed. Aggressive. Dire condition.

Her eyes fell to the bottom of the page. Below the signature, the sender had not written more words. They had drawn.

It was a sketch, done in swift, confident strokes of charcoal. A human form, simplified, was depicted in the center. And extending from it, instead of a single, cohesive silhouette, was a nightmare.

The shadow was a monstrous, sprawling thing. It did not follow the laws of light or anatomy. It sprouted a chaos of limbs—too many, bent at impossible angles, some ending in claws, others in blunted, sickening pads. It seemed to seethe outward, a tangle of dark tendrils that suggested both insectile legs and the roots of a malignant plant. The human figure in the sketch was small, frail, being consumed by this violent, amorphous twin. It was a shadow that did not follow, but led. That did not define, but distorted.

Elara dropped the paper as if it had grown hot.

It fluttered to the rug, the sketch facing up. The many-legged darkness seemed to pulse in the dim light. She had spent her life studying the gentle waning of the light-within, the peaceful dissolution of the soul’s echo. This was not dissolution. This was mutation. This was a shadow with a will.

A cold that had nothing to do with the evening air settled in her bones. The hollow in her chest yawned wider. She thought of her own absent shadow, a different kind of anomaly. Was this somehow related? A perverse counterpart to her own void?

The oil lamps remained unlit. She stood in the gathering dark of her parlor, the luminous phials on her worktable casting tiny, defiant pools of color. Outside, the last of the sun surrendered to the twilight. The note lay at her feet, a silent, screaming summons.

Triple her rate. A unique and dire condition.

And a sketch that promised not grief, but horror.

Elara wrapped her arms around herself, staring at the terrible drawing until its lines seemed to burn themselves onto her vision. The fading parlor, with its gentle sorrows and bittersweet loans, was suddenly a child’s nursery. Something had just knocked at the door of the world she understood, and it had left behind not a calling card, but a confession of a disease she had never dreamed possible.

She would have to go. There was no question. Not for the money.

But to see what happened when a shadow decided to live.
