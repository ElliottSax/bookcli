Chapter 5: The Gray Wastes

Chapter 5: The Gray Wastes

The road to the Hinterlands did not so much end as dissolve. The cobblestones, worn smooth by centuries of commerce and pilgrimage, gave way to packed earth, then to a coarse, gray grit that whispered under Elara’s boots like a sigh. The forests that had flanked her journey for days thinned, their trunks becoming spectral, their leaves bleaching to a sickly silver before falling in silent, weightless drifts. It was as if the world was being sketched by an artist running out of ink.

The sun, on the third day into this bleached territory, became a pale sovereign. It hung in a sky the color of unpolished pewter, shedding a light that illuminated without warmth, that revealed without color. The vibrant green of her cloak now seemed a vulgar, impossible memory. The red of her hair, a dull rust. Everything was reduced to a spectrum of ash, charcoal, and bone-white. It was a quiet, pervasive leeching that felt less like an environmental change and more like a slow forgetting. Elara found herself straining to recall the exact hue of Alistair’s study, the rich ochre of the lamplight. It was fading, replaced by this pervasive, luminous gray.

And the shadows… they were wrong.

At first, she noticed their independence. A rock would cast a long, thin shade that seemed to quiver slightly, out of sync with the unmoving air. Her own shadow, trailing behind her, would sometimes lag a half-step, as if reluctant to follow. Then, as the light grew paler, the shadows grew more substantive. They were not mere absences of light, but entities with a soft, velvety texture. They pooled in hollows with a tangible depth, and they moved with a languid, sentient curiosity. Once, stopping to drink from her canteen, she saw the shadow of a skeletal tree branch slowly uncoil and stretch toward her pack, its tapered end probing the air like a finger. She stood abruptly, and it snapped back into place, perfectly aligned with the wood above. But the air where it had moved felt colder.

It was on the fourth day she met the first of the drifters.

She was picking her way through a field of brittle, gray grass that chimed like broken glass when stepped on. A figure appeared on the crest of a low rise, silhouetted against the pallid sky. It moved with a shuffling, aimless gait. As it drew nearer, Elara saw it was a man, perhaps in his middle years, clothed in rags of indeterminate color. His face was gaunt, his eyes a washed-out blue. But it was his shadow that arrested her.

It was faint, a smudge of darker gray on the gray earth. And it was listless. It did not stream behind him as he walked; it merely existed at his feet, a puddle of weak definition. It had no dynamism, no echo of his movements. It was a ghost of a ghost.

The man stopped a few paces away, his eyes drifting over her without interest, then past her, to some point in the middle distance.

“Good day,” Elara said, her voice too loud in the muffled atmosphere.

The man’s gaze slowly swam back to her. He blinked. “Is it?” he asked, the words devoid of inflection.

“I’m looking for the Hinterlands.”

A faint ripple of something—memory, perhaps—crossed his face. “Ahead. Always ahead. Where the light goes to forget.” He took a step closer, and Elara instinctively stepped back. His eyes dropped to her feet, to the strong, clear shadow she cast despite the weak sun. His brow furrowed slightly. “You have a… sharp one.”

“My shadow?”

He nodded, almost imperceptibly. “Mine is tired. It sleeps most days. Sometimes I forget to wake it.” He looked at his own faint smudge with a kind of detached pity. “It took my wedding day, I think. The taste of the wine. Or was that the other one? They take little pieces. Quietly. You don’t miss them until you reach for them and find only dust.”

A chill that had nothing to do with the temperature crept up Elara’s spine. “Who takes them?”

“The gray,” he whispered, as if it were obvious. “The hungry gray.” He shuffled past her then, his faint shadow dragging like a soiled hem. Elara watched him until he was a speck again, swallowed by the bleached landscape. She touched the leather satchel at her hip, feeling the hard outline of the small, lead-cased vial within. Alistair’s advance payment. A thimbleful of primordial light, siphoned from a dying star-core in a vault below the Academy. It felt warm against her thigh, a tiny, fierce sun.

She camped that night in the lee of a large, weathered stone. As the pale sun bled away into a twilight that was merely a deeper gray, the shadows awoke. They detached from their objects. The stone’s shadow slithered out like a thick, black oil. The shadows of the glass-grass merged into a whispering, shifting carpet that seemed to inch toward her small, cold fireless camp. Elara felt a pressure, a silent, collective attention. She fumbled in her satchel, her fingers closing around the vial.

As she drew it out, its casing dull, the effect was immediate. The creeping shadows halted. From the seam of the cap, a fierce, golden radiance leaked—not a beam, but a glow that seemed to push at the very texture of the gray world. The stone’s shadow recoiled, snapping back to its base. The whispering grass-shadows stilled. In a circle around her, perhaps five feet in radius, the gray grit regained a hint of ochre, the air lost its deathly chill. The light from the vial was a sound, a scent, a memory of color. It was protection. But as she held it, she felt a terrible pang of guilt. She was a fraud, using stolen light to ward off shadows while her own was a stitched-together abomination. The drifter’s words echoed: You have a sharp one.

The next afternoon, she found the village.

It was less a village than a collection of low, rounded huts built from the same gray mud and bleached grass that comprised the wastes. It huddled around a still, dark pond that reflected nothing of the sky. But it was the people who stopped her in her tracks.

They were gathered in the open space by the pond, kneeling on the ground. Each villager had a small pot of something beside them—paint, or dye, or ash mixed with water. And they were painting. With careful, ritualistic strokes, they were painting their own shadows onto the hard-packed earth.

An old woman with hands like knotted roots meticulously filled in the outline of a stooped form. A young man drew the elongated shadow of a tool he held—a hoe, perhaps—though he held nothing in his actual hands. They worked in utter silence, their faces masks of concentration. The painted shadows were vibrant against the gray—deep blacks, rich browns, even hints of dark blue or green. They were idealized, perfect, far more vivid and defined than the faint, real shadows the weak sun cast of them, which lay limply across their freshly painted art, a pathetic, translucent echo.

An elder, seeing her approach, stood. His painted shadow was that of a tall, straight-backed man with a staff, though he himself was bent. “You are on the road,” he stated, his voice like the grating of stones.

“I am. To the Hinterlands.”

A collective shiver went through the painters. They did not look up, but their strokes became more urgent.

“The Borrowed Lands,” the elder said, gesturing to the wastes around them. “Here, the light is thin. It forgets its duty. It does not hold our shapes properly. Our true shadows… they become faint. They forget us. So, we remind the world.” He pointed a bony finger at his magnificent painted shadow. “This is me. This is my substance. The thing the light casts now…” He glanced dismissively at the watery gray shape at his feet. “…that is just a rumor.”

Elara felt a profound, melancholic awe. This was grief made ritual. A daily defiance against erasure. “What happens if you don’t paint it?”

The elder’s eyes grew distant. “You become a drifter. Your shadow sleeps. And then it, or the things that move in the deeper gray, takes pieces. Your memories. Your loves. The sound of a specific laugh. You become a outline with nothing inside. The painting… it anchors. It says, ‘I was here. I am this.’ Even if it is a lie.” He looked at her sharply, his eyes dropping to her satchel. “You carry a piece of the old light. The true light.”

It was not a question. She nodded.

“It will not last,” he said, not unkindly. “Nothing does. Not even memory. Especially not memory.” He turned back to his painting, dipping his brush to deepen the shadow of the staff. “Stay the night. The things that walk in the late gray are bold. Your little light will be a beacon, but it will also be a shield. For our sake, as well as yours.”

They gave her a hut, empty save for a pallet of dry grass. That evening, as a deeper, velvety darkness fell—the first true darkness she’d seen in days—the village changed. The painted shadows seemed to absorb the last of the light, glowing with an inner luminescence. The people retreated into their huts, and Elara heard the soft, solid sound of bolts being drawn. She uncapped her vial just a crack. The golden light flooded her small space, warm and sweet-smelling, pushing the pressing, curious darkness beyond her threshold into a perfect, circular wall of black.

She slept fitfully, haunted by images of painted shadows peeling off the ground and walking alone through the wastes.

At dawn, as the pale sun reasserted itself, she prepared to leave. The villagers were already outside, washing away yesterday’s paintings with water from the pond, preparing to paint anew. The elder approached her, holding out a small, clay pot. “Pigment. From the old riverbed. It holds a memory of blue. For your shadow. It might… help it remember you, when the light gets too thin.”

Elara took it, a lump in her throat. “Thank you.”

As she turned to go, a figure detached itself from the side of a hut. It was a drifter, a woman, her dress a faded gray sack, her hair a colorless curtain. She must have arrived in the night. Her shadow was so faint it was barely a suggestion of mist on the ground. The woman stared at Elara with a vacant intensity. She shuffled forward, her hand rising not toward Elara, but toward the satchel where the vial lay hidden.

Instinctively, Elara caught the woman’s wrist. The skin was cold, papery.

The contact seemed to jolt the drifter. Her vacant eyes focused, not on Elara’s face, but on their joined hands. She did not look at Elara’s shadow, but through it, as if seeing the frantic, sutured network of stolen shades that comprised it. The woman’s breath hitched. A tremor of raw, undiluted awareness—the first real emotion Elara had seen in these wastes—passed over her features. It was horror.

She yanked her hand back as if scorched. Her whisper was a dry leaf scraping stone, yet it carried through the still morning air, silencing the painters.

“You are not a borrower.” Her eyes were wide, clear pools of terror in her gray face. She pointed a trembling finger at Elara’s chest, not at the vial, but at her heart. “You are a thief.”

The villagers froze, their brushes dripping forgotten pigment.

The drifter took another step back, her form beginning to tremble as if the effort of coherence was breaking her apart. She hugged herself, and her final words were not spoken to Elara, but to the vast, hungry gray all around them, a confession and a warning rolled into one.

“And the Lightless One will know its own.”

Then she turned and stumbled away, her faint shadow dissolving into the bleached earth, leaving Elara alone in the circle of silent, staring villagers, the pot of memory-blue heavy in her hand, and a new, more intimate kind of cold seeping into the marrow of her stolen bones.
