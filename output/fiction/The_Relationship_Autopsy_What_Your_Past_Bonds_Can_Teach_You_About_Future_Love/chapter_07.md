Chapter 7: Witness Testimony: Interpreting Your Inner Voices

The autopsy table is clear. The evidence from your past relationships—the patterns, the wounds, the hidden contracts—lies catalogued under the bright light of inquiry. But a question lingers, a whisper in the stillness: Who was calling the shots?
If our relationships are the crime scenes, then the witnesses are not in the external world. They live inside you. They are the voices in your head that narrated every date, argued during every conflict, and whispered (or shouted) verdicts on your worth. To understand the case of your love life, you must now call them to the stand. The courtroom of your mind is in session. The jury is your future. It’s time to hear from the board of directors who have been running your heart.
The Gavel Falls: Meeting the Board

Picture the control room of your psyche. It’s not a sterile place. It smells faintly of old paper and nervous sweat, like a library before a final exam. The lighting is uneven—a harsh fluorescent glare over one chair, a soft, warm lamp over another. In the center is a large, scarred oak table. Your internal board members sit around it. They’ve been here for years, often talking over one another, each convinced they are in charge.
Let’s meet them.
First, The Critic. You know this voice. It’s the one that folds its arms, taps a stern finger on the table, and speaks in the clipped tone of a disappointed prosecutor. “You saw the red flag and you walked right toward it. Again. You’re too needy. Too much. Not enough. You always pick the wrong ones. What did you expect?” The Critic’s suit is perfectly pressed, its face a mask of cold efficiency. It believes its harshness is the only thing keeping you from total failure.
Next, The Protector. This one wears emotional body armor—sometimes it looks like aloofness, sometimes like sarcasm, sometimes like a wall of cheerful people-pleasing. Its voice can be a hissed warning or a soothing, dangerous lie. “Don’t be vulnerable. That’s how you get hurt. Just agree. Keep the peace. Leave before they can leave you. Love is a tactical operation.” The Protector’s chair is pushed back from the table, angled toward the door, always ready for flight or fight. It smells of ozone, like the air after a lightning strike.
In the corner, often under that soft lamp, is The Child. This isn’t a voice of immaturity, but of raw, unfiltered emotion. It holds the original wounds. It speaks in feelings, not logic. When you feel a wave of abandonment panic during a partner’s quiet evening, that’s The Child. When you feel a burst of desperate joy at the slightest affection, that’s The Child, too. It doesn’t speak in full sentences, but in sensations: a tight chest, a hot face, a sinking stomach, a giddy heart. It’s clutching a worn-out toy, looking for safety.
Then, there is The Sage. This seat is often empty, or occupied by a faint, translucent figure the others ignore. The Sage has no uniform. Its presence is a calm hum, like the sound of distant ocean waves heard through a shell. It does not shout. It observes. It connects. It speaks with compassionate clarity. “You are afraid. That fear is old. Look at what is actually happening, right now.” The Sage’s voice is your truest voice, the integrated adult who can feel for The Child, respect what The Protector is trying to do, and redirect The Critic’s energy, all without being ruled by any of them.
For most of our relationship lives, we mistake the loudest voice for the truth. The Critic’s gavel slams, and we accept its judgment. The Protector shoves us into a closet and locks the door, and we thank it for our safety. The Child wails, and we let it drive the car, wondering why we keep crashing.
The Transcripts: Which Voice Was In Charge?
Your task now is linguistic detective work. You are going to review the transcripts from key moments in your past relationships and identify who was really in charge.
Take a recent conflict. Not the broad “we grew apart,” but a specific, charged conversation. Close your eyes. Recall your Metaphorical Morgue. The quality of the light—was it the gray wash of a rainy evening through a window? The smell of half-eaten takeout on the coffee table. The feeling of the couch fabric beneath you. Now, replay the words spoken inside your head.
When they said, “I need some space,” what was your internal dialogue?
If it was a flood of “See? You ruined it. You’re too clingy. You always do this. You’ll die alone,”—that’s The Critic holding court, using the present moment as proof of your fundamental flaw.
If it was a swift, internal flinch followed by “Fine. Whatever. I didn’t care that much anyway. I’ll just pull back first. I’ll start looking for an exit,”—that’s The Protector, slamming down the emotional blast doors.
If it was a wave of dread that left you feeling abandoned, a sinking feeling in your gut that screamed you're being left behind - that's The Child, reacting not to the person in front of you, but to a deep-seated fear.
In those moments, you might hear a gentle voice saying, "This hurts, but it's not about you. It's about the other person's need for space. Let's feel this pain without letting it consume us." That's The Sage, speaking through the noise.
Think about the times you've made big decisions, like swiping right on someone's profile or moving in together. Who made the final call? Often, it's a combination of voices. The Child wants the comfort of something familiar, while The Protector says, "This is safe because we know what to expect." The Critic might chime in, saying, "You don't deserve better, so you might as well settle." But The Sage's voice can get lost in the noise.
Now, let's take a closer look at these voices. We're not trying to get rid of them, but rather understand why they're there. Each voice is trying to protect you in its own way.
The Critic is like a strict coach who uses shame to motivate you. It thinks that if it can make you feel bad enough, you'll never take a risk that might hurt you again. It wants to make you invincible, but its methods are harsh and unkind.
The Protector is like a security expert who's been trained to prevent a specific kind of hurt. If you were neglected as a child, it might teach you to be self-sufficient. If you were smothered, it might build walls to keep people out. If you were criticized, it might teach you to be invisible. It will do whatever it takes to keep you safe, even if that means causing harm.
The Child is a reminder of the pain you've experienced. Its cries are not manipulative, but a genuine expression of unmet needs and unresolved fears. It holds your capacity for joy and love, but also your deep-seated hurt. It doesn't understand time, so a rejection today can feel like a rejection from years ago.
When you see these voices for what they are - misguided attempts to protect you - you can start to feel compassion for them. You can look at The Critic and say, "I understand what you're trying to do, but your methods are causing more harm than good." You can tell The Protector, "I appreciate your efforts, but the danger has passed. You can stand down." You can comfort The Child by saying, "I'm here for you, and I'll take care of you."

This is how you take back control. Not by silencing these voices, but by understanding where they come from and taking charge.
The Sage is not a new voice you need to create, but the person you become when you can observe these other voices without getting caught up in them. It's the part of you that can hold conflicting truths at the same time: you're hurt, but you'll be okay; this person is triggering you, but they're not your parent; your protector is trying to help, but its strategy is outdated.
Cultivating The Sage is about creating space between what happens to you and how you react. It's like building a quiet room in a chaotic space where you can think clearly before making a decision.
Here’s how you begin:
The Pause and Identify Drill: Next time you feel a strong emotional charge in your relationship—anxiety, rage, crushing shame—pause. Literally, if you can, stop moving. Feel your feet on the floor. Take a breath that expands your ribs. Then, ask internally: “Who is speaking right now?” Is it the cold, sharp tone of The Critic? The strategic, armored voice of The Protector? The wordless, overwhelming sensation of The Child? Simply naming it—“Ah, that’s The Protector, going into lockdown”—creates instant distance. You are not the voice; you are the one hearing it.
Thank and Redirect: Acknowledge the voice’s intent. “Thank you, Protector, for trying to keep me safe. I’ve got this now.” “Thank you, Critic, for wanting me to improve. I will learn from this with kindness.” This isn’t placation. It’s a sovereign act of reassigning duties.
Consult the Child with Compassion: Ask The Child, directly and gently, “What do you need to feel safe right now?” The answer is rarely about the partner. It might be: “To know I won’t be left.” “To know my feelings matter.” “To be seen.” Then, as the adult, you can give that to yourself. You can say, “I am here. I will not abandon you. Your feelings matter.” This is how you stop outsourcing your inner child’s care to a partner, a burden no relationship can long sustain.
Speak from the Sage’s Chair: Once you’ve heard from the board, make your decision or response from the Sage. The Sage’s language is clear, kind, and boundaried. It uses “I” statements that own emotion without blame. Instead of The Child’s wail (“You never listen to me!”) or The Protector’s attack (“You’re a selfish partner!”), The Sage says, “I feel disconnected when we talk over each other. Can we try again?” It holds your dignity and the other person’s humanity in the same hand.
The Gavel is in Your Hand

You are reviewing the final case file—the relationship that brought you here. You can now hear the witness testimony with new clarity.
The night of the final argument, who was really speaking? It was your Protector, armed with your father’s dismissive tone, pushing them away before they could reject you. It was your Child, feeling the same terrifying helplessness you on the playground when everyone picked a team but you. It was your Critic, narrating the disaster in real time: “This is why you’re unlovable.”*

And where were you? The integrated, compassionate adult? You were absent from The Metaphorical Morgue. You had abdicated your chair.
That abdication ends now.
The testimony is complete. The evidence is irrefutable. You finally understand who has been driving the bus, often with a scared child in their lap, a critic screaming directions, and a protector ready to steer into a ditch to avoid a shadow.
Now, the gavel is in your hand. It feels solid, weighted with your own authority. The board looks to you, waiting. The Critic adjusts its tie, ready to deliver another summation. The Protector’s hand is on the door handle. The Child looks up, eyes wide.
You take a breath—a Sage’s breath, deep and full. You look at each of them, these parts of you that have survived so much. You are not firing them. You are promoting them. The Critic’s sharp eye for detail can become discernment. The Protector’s fierce loyalty can become healthy boundaries. The Child’s emotional truth can become your guiding compass.
But they will no longer preside. You will.
The gavel does not need to slam. It simply needs to be held, a quiet symbol of who is in charge. You place it gently on the table before you.
Your next relationship will not be tried in the court of old wounds. It will be built in the sanctuary of your own compassionate authority. The first witness to be called to the stand in this new case will be the one who has been silent too long: your future self. What will they testify that you were brave enough to become?
