  "plot_summary": "This self-help guide presents a metaphorical framework for analyzing past relationships. It begins by inviting the reader into 'The Morgue' to perform an 'autopsy' on a failed relationship, not to assign blame but to discover the true 'cause of death' beneath the superficial headlines. Through this clinical, compassionate dissection, the reader learns to identify their own patterns, communication failures, and core needs. The narrative then transitions from the morgue to 'The Drafting Room,' where the insights gained are used not to dwell on the past, but to draft a precise 'blueprint' for future love. The book culminates by equipping the reader with tools for precise communication, conscious choice, and the ongoing work of building a healthier emotional life, closing the door on the past and stepping into the role of a clear-eyed architect of their own future.",
