Chapter 2: The Timeline of Events: Establishing Chronology

The investigation begins not with a theory, but with a sequence. In any examination, the first task is to establish the when. Before motive, before method, we need the cold, hard scaffold of chronology. This is our foundation. Without it, our memories—those vivid, emotional, and notoriously unreliable witnesses—will lead us in circles, pointing fingers at shadows while the truth sits plainly in the light of day.

Think of the most gripping true-crime documentary you’ve ever seen. What’s the first thing they show, often over a haunting, minimalist score? A timeline. Simple text on a dark screen: First Contact. The Shift. The End. It feels grounding, even as the story spirals into complexity. It says: This happened. Then this. Then that. It is the skeleton of the story, and we must assemble it bone by bone, without yet dressing it in the flesh of feeling.

Your task in this chapter is to become an archivist of your own heart. We are not writing a memoir, not yet. We are filling out a case file. We are separating the facts of the relationship from the experience of it. The fact is you met on June 12th at a friend’s barbecue. The experience was the smell of charcoal and citronella, the cold shock of the beer can in your hand, the way their laugh cut through the murmur of the party and seemed meant for your ears alone. Hold that sensory memory, cherish it, but for now, place it in the evidence locker. We’ll come back for it. Right now, we need the date.

The Tools: Your Neutral Workspace

Find a quiet hour. Gather your tools: a large sheet of paper, a notebook, or a digital document—whatever feels most like a blank slate. This is your evidence board. You might want two different colored pens: one for Facts (black), one for your contemporaneous Feelings (blue), but for this initial timeline, we will use only the black. We are building with the objectivity of stone.

At the top, write a simple, clinical title: Relationship Chronology: [Initials of Partner/Relationship]. Below, draw a long, horizontal line. This is your timeline. We will mark it with events, not interpretations.

The First Milestone: The "First Response"

Every story has an inciting incident. In forensic terms, this is the "first response"—the moment the call came in. In relationship terms, it is the moment of initial attraction or connection. Not the "love at first sight" story you’ve polished over time, but the raw, factual spark.

Fact: We matched on the dating app on March 14th. First message exchanged at 9:47 PM.
What you might be thinking: This is where it all began. That stupid, hopeful little ping.
The unspoken tension: The chasm between that digital notification and everything that followed.
Fact: We were introduced by Sarah at the gallery opening on October 5th. Spoke for approximately 20 minutes.
What you might be thinking: Twenty minutes. Was that really all it took?
Physical beat: Your pen hovers over the page. Approximately. Even now, you can't be exact. Some part of you is still back there, lost in the conversation, forgetting to check the time.
Fact: We were assigned as partners for the quarterly project at work on January 7th.
What you might be thinking: A coincidence. Fate. A managerial oversight you’ve thanked every day since. Or cursed.
Meaningful pause: You stare at the date. January 7th. It was a Tuesday. You remember because you’d had a terrible Monday. You write it down, the numbers feeling both insignificant and monumental.

Note the date. Note the concrete circumstance. Now, in parentheses, you may allow yourself a single, factual sensory detail—the data your body recorded. (He was wearing a green sweater that matched his eyes.) (The gallery was overheated, and she fanned herself with the program.) (The conference room smelled of stale coffee.)* This is still evidence. It is an observable detail.

Place this point on the far left of your timeline. Label it: First Contact. The ink bleeds a little. You press too hard.
