  "subgenre": "relationships",
  "premise": "Using the gripping, detailed case-study method of a forensic investigator, this book guides readers through dissecting their own past relationships\u2014both romantic and platonic\u2014to uncover the hidden patterns, unresolved wounds, and unconscious scripts that sabotage their present connections. By treating each past bond as a 'cold case' to be solved, readers learn to identify the evidence of their own behavior, leading to profound self-awareness and the tools to build healthier, more intentional relationships.",
  "protagonist": "The Reader, positioned as both the detective and the subject of the investigation.",
  "conflict": "The central conflict is internal: the struggle between the reader's desire for fulfilling relationships and the unseen, repetitive patterns from their past that actively work against it. Each case study presents a clash between conscious intention and subconscious programming.",
  "setting": "Present day, primarily within the reader's own memory, journal, and current relational dynamics. The 'lab' for the autopsy is the reader's mind and personal reflection space.",
  "tone": "Curious, forensic, empowering, and compassionate. It blends the intriguing clarity of a true-crime documentary with the supportive warmth of therapeutic guidance, avoiding blame in favor of objective discovery."
