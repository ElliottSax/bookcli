The words on the page blurred as Maya’s tears fell, the truth heavy on her. She had spent her life trying to earn love, to be seen and chosen. But the truth was she had never truly been seen, not in the way that mattered. She had been loved, but not in the way she needed.
As she sat there, the silence in The Metaphorical Morgue grew heavier, the weight of her emotions pressing in. She knew she had to keep moving, to follow the echoes of her past and uncover the truth about the wounds that shaped her life. She took a deep breath and write again.
"Blueprint 2: The Unseen Child," she wrote, the words flowing onto the page like a river of pain. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you invisible. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?"

Maya closed her eyes and let the memories wash over her. She remembered the playground, the sound of children laughing, the feeling of being alone even when surrounded by others. The message she had learned was clear: To be loved is to be noticed, but not truly seen. Connection is a performance, not a reality.
"Blueprint 3: The Burden of Being," she wrote. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you like a burden. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?" She remembered the car rides, her mother’s sighs, the feeling of being a problem to be solved, not a person to be loved. The message was clear: To be loved is to be convenient, but not truly seen. Connection is a favor, not a right.
"Blueprint 4: The Conditional Love," she wrote. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you love was conditional. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?" She remembered the living room, her father’s voice, the feeling of being loved only when she was good, quiet, perfect. The message was clear: To be loved is to be perfect, but not truly seen. Connection is a reward, not a given.
"Blueprint 5: The Fear of Abandonment," she wrote. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you abandoned. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?" She remembered the backyard, the sound of the wind, the feeling of being left alone and forgotten. The message was clear: To be loved is to be held, but not truly seen. Connection is a promise, not a guarantee.
"Blueprint 6: The Need for Approval," she wrote. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you need for approval. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?" She remembered the classroom, the teacher’s voice, the feeling of being judged, the need to be perfect. The message was clear: To be loved is to be approved, but not truly seen. Connection is a performance, not a reality.
"Blueprint 7: The Fear of Rejection," she wrote. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you fear of rejection. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?" She remembered the hallway, the sound of her own heartbeat, the feeling of being left out. The message was clear: To be loved is to be chosen, but not truly seen. Connection is a gamble, not a certainty.
"Blueprint 8: The Need for Safety," she wrote. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you need for safety. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?" She remembered the bedroom, the sound of the rain, the feeling of being alone and needing comfort. The message was clear: To be loved is to be safe, but not truly seen. Connection is a refuge, not a home.
"Blueprint 9: The Fear of Being Too Much," she wrote. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you fear of being too much. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?" She remembered the dining room, her mother’s voice, the feeling of being too loud, too needy, too much. The message was clear: To be loved is to be small, but not truly seen. Connection is a negotiation, not a gift.
"Blueprint 10: The Need for Control," she wrote. "Think of a recurring scene from childhood, around age 4-7, where you need for control. Where are you? What do you hear? What do you feel?"
