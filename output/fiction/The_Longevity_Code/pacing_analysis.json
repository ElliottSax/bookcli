  "analysis": "Based on the provided excerpts, here is a pacing analysis for this non-fiction science/health book:\n\n**HOOK: 8 | TENSION: 3 | TRANSITIONS: 6 | FIX: Introduce narrative or concrete examples to break up expository blocks.**\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Hook Strength (8):** The opening is intellectually strong, effectively reframing aging from an inevitability to a \"malleable\" biological process and positioning it as \"the most fundamental form of preventative medicine.\" This creates a compelling \"promise of knowledge\" for the engaged reader.\n2.  **Tension Building (3):** As non-fiction, it builds tension conceptually rather than narratively. The tension comes from the stakes it establishes (cognitive decline, disease risk). However, the pacing is uniformly expository. The middle chapter's hook about stress being a greater threat than Alzheimer's is good, but the tension then plateaus into explanation without rhythmic variation.\n3. ",
