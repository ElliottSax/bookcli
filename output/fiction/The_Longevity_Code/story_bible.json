  "narrative_voice": "Second-person direct address, speaking to the reader as 'you' throughout. The voice is that of a knowledgeable, authoritative guide who synthesizes complex scientific research into clear, actionable insights. The tone shifts between educational exposition (explaining mechanisms) and motivational coaching (encouraging behavior change).",
  "tone": "Authoritative yet empowering. Scientifically rigorous but accessible to lay readers. Optimistic without being naive, acknowledging the complexity of aging while emphasizing the substantial control individuals have over their healthspan. The writing is dense with research citations and expert quotes, lending credibility while maintaining readability.",
  "plot_summary": "The Longevity Code is a comprehensive guide to the science of aging and evidence-based strategies for extending healthspan. The book begins by decoding the fundamental biology of why we age, introducing the reader to the nine hallmarks of aging including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and cellular senescence. This foundational knowledge establishes that aging is not a vague, inevitable process but a series of interconnected biological mechanisms that can be influenced through deliberate intervention.\n\nThe middle chapters systematically explore the major lifestyle pillars that affect longevity: metabolic health through insulin management and intermittent fasting; physical exercise as a multi-system therapy for cellular health; nutritional intelligence beyond fad diets; the critical role of sleep and stress management in cognitive resilience; environmental factors including toxins, light exposure, and temperature; and the profound biological impact of social connection and purpose. Each chapter grounds its recommendations in peer-reviewed research while translating findings into practical protocols.\n\nThe book concludes by moving from population-level recommendations to personalized longevity, teaching readers how to interpret their own biomarkers and genetics to create individualized protocols. The final chapter synthesizes all pillars into an integrated, dynamic 'century-long vitality plan' that emphasizes the synergistic interactions between lifestyle factors. The overarching message is one of empowerment: while genetics play a role, the vast majority of healthspan is determined by modifiable behaviors, and understanding the science allows readers to become active architects of their own longevity rather than passive observers of decline.",
