  "narrative_voice": "Third-person limited, primarily following Elena with occasional chapters from Jax's perspective to provide additional context and build tension. The prose is lean and propulsive, reflecting the harsh efficiency required for Martian survival, but allows for moments of lyrical reflection when characters confront the alien beauty of their world. Technical details are woven naturally into the narrative, making the futuristic setting feel lived-in rather than expository.",
  "tone": "Tense and atmospheric with an undercurrent of noir sensibility. The story balances high-stakes action with character-driven drama, maintaining forward momentum while allowing emotional complexity. Moments of dark humor provide relief from the tension, often arising from the absurdities of corporate bureaucracy persisting even on the frontier. The overall effect is one of mounting dread punctuated by genuine human connection.",
  "plot_summary": "When Elena Vasquez receives word that her estranged father, Marcus Aldrich, has died and left her his entire fortune, she wants nothing to do with it. She fled the Aldrich dynasty fifteen years ago, determined to build a life free from their wealth and influence. But the inheritance comes with conditions: Elena must solve a series of puzzles and challenges her father designed before his death, each one leading to the next piece of a secret he took extreme measures to protect. If she fails or refuses, the fortune - and whatever her father was hiding - falls into the hands of Director Tomas Reinholt, a man she instinctively distrusts.\n\nReluctantly partnering with Jax Okonkwo, a private investigator her father hired before his death, Elena begins to unravel a conspiracy that reaches from the depths of Martian mines to the highest levels of colonial government. Someone murdered Marcus Aldrich, and that same someone is now hunting Elena. As bodies pile up and the puzzle trail leads to increasingly dangerous locations, Elena discovers that her father's secret involves a discovery that could change humanity's understanding of Mars itself - evidence of ancient, dormant life deep beneath the planet's surface. Aldrich Industries has been suppressing this discovery for decades, and powerful forces will kill to keep it hidden.\n\nThe final confrontation takes place at the Aldrich Estate, where Elena must face not only Reinholt and his mercenaries but also the truth about her father's final years. Marcus Aldrich spent his last decade trying to protect the discovery and find a way to reveal it without causing societal collapse. His elaborate inheritance was designed to ensure only Elena - the daughter who rejected everything he stood for - could be trusted to finish what he started. In claiming her inheritance, Elena must decide whether to expose the truth and transform Mars forever, or protect it and let the old order continue. Her choice will define not only her future but the future of two worlds."
