  "premise": "In a remote, government-monitored 'sound sanctuary' for people with severe misophonia, the carefully controlled silence is shattered by a sonic entity that hunts by auditory signature. The final girl, Anya, who came to the facility to escape a world of unbearable noise, realizes her own heightened sensitivity is the only way to track the creature\u2014but every sound she makes to survive paints a target on her back. To win, she must weaponize the very condition that brought her there, in a deadly game of silence versus sound.",
  "protagonist": "Anya, a reclusive audio archivist with extreme misophonia, whose traumatic past has honed her hearing into a razor-sharp, often debilitating tool.",
  "conflict": "Anya must outsmart a creature that perceives and attacks through sound waves, while trapped in a facility where every survivor's panic, every creak of the floorboard, and every beat of her own heart could summon a gruesome death. The central tension pits her need to make noise to fight back against the certainty that doing so will reveal her location.",
  "setting": "Present day, within the sterile, sound-dampened halls and forested perimeter of the privately-owned 'Haven Institute,' a research facility deep in the Pacific Northwest.",
  "tone": "Claustrophobic, nerve-shredding suspense punctuated by bursts of visceral body horror, built on a foundation of eerie quiet and dreadful anticipation of the next sound."
