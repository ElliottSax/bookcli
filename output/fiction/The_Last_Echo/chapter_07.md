—a towering, amorphous mass that pulsed with the stolen sounds of its victims, a grotesque, living sculpture of stolen voices and echoes. At its core, the glimmers of light swirled like a galaxy of dying stars.

Leo was on his knees, the dagger limp in his hand. His breath came in ragged gasps, his face streaked with sweat and blood from a gash on his temple. The entity loomed over him, its form shifting, undulating, as if it were tasting the air, savoring the moment.

Anya’s pulse roared in her ears. She took a step forward, her fingers tightening around the grip of her own weapon—a compact, high-frequency emitter, its barrel humming with a barely audible whine.

The entity turned towards her. Its form rippled, and for a moment, she saw herself reflected in its shifting surface—a distorted, ghostly version of her own face, mouth open in a silent scream.

“Anya, no!” Leo’s voice was raw, desperate. “It’s too late. It’s learned. It’s—”

The entity cut him off. It spoke, for the first time, in a voice that was a patchwork of every sound it had ever absorbed—a chorus of whispers, screams, and half-remembered melodies.

“You are a part of the song,” it said, the words a discordant harmony. “You are a note in the symphony of prey.”

Anya’s breath hitched. The voice was a physical thing, a pressure in her chest, a vibration in her bones. She raised the emitter, her hands steady despite the terror clawing at her throat.

“You’re wrong,” she said, her voice a thin, brittle thing against the entity’s chorus. “We’re not prey. We’re the ones who make the noise.”

She pulled the trigger.

The emitter released a burst of high-frequency sound, a sonic blade that cut through the air with a visible shimmer. It struck the entity, and for a moment, the creature recoiled, its form flickering, the stolen sounds within it warping, distorting.

But it didn’t die. It laughed.

The sound was a cacophony of agony and delight, a symphony of every scream and sob it had ever consumed. It swelled, filling the chamber, shaking the walls, rattling the pipes.

Anya’s knees buckled. The pain was a white-hot lance through her skull, her eardrums, her very soul. She fell to the ground, her fingers clawing at her ears, her vision swimming with black spots.

Through the agony, she saw Leo. He was crawling towards her, his face a mask of pain, his mouth moving in a silent scream. He reached her, his hands gripping her shoulders, his eyes wide with terror and something else—something like love.

“Anya,” he mouthed, the word a whisper lost in the storm of sound.

The entity loomed over them, its form shifting, expanding, its stolen voices rising to a deafening crescendo. It was growing, feeding on their pain, their fear, their love.

Anya’s vision blurred. The world was sound, and sound was the world, and the world was ending.

Then, a new sound cut through the chaos.

A sharp, metallic clang.

The entity froze. Its form flickered, the stolen sounds within it stuttering, warping. The new sound was a pure, steady tone, a light of sonic defiance.

The prototype dagger.

Leo was holding it, his hand trembling, his face a mask of determination. He had reactivated it. The sound was a pure, steady tone, a light of sonic defiance.

The entity recoiled, its form flickering, the stolen sounds within it warping, distorting. It shrank, its edges fraying, its stolen voices fading, as if the dagger’s tone was a sonic vacuum, sucking the life out of it.

Anya’s breath came in ragged gasps. She forced herself to her feet, her hands gripping the emitter, her eyes locked on the entity.

“Now,” Leo said, his voice a thin, brittle thing against the storm of sound. “Now, Anya. End it.”

She raised the emitter, her hands steady despite the terror clawing at her throat. She pulled the trigger.
