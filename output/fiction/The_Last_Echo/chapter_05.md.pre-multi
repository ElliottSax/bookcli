Chapter 5: Echoes in the Dark

The world didn’t end with a scream, but with a sigh.

A deep, mechanical exhalation breathed through the ventilation shafts. The sanctuary's heartbeat—that constant background hum of white noise, air filters, and distant generators—stuttered and died. Anya was in her bunk, forcing down a tasteless nutrient bar, when it happened. The lights flickered, not dramatically, but with a tired dimming, like something closing its eyes. Then, they went out.

Not all of them. Emergency strips along the floor glowed a sickly green, casting more shadow than light, turning the corridor outside her door into a trench of gloom. The main lights were gone, and with them, the soundscape of her entire world.

The silence was absolute. It wasn't peaceful. It was a vacuum.

Anya dropped the nutrient bar. It didn't clatter; it thudded dully on the padded floor, the sound absurdly loud in the new quiet. Her own breathing turned into a hurricane in her ears—the rush of air, the wet click in her throat, the shudder of her ribs. She clamped a hand over her mouth, but that only made the internal noise louder: the pounding of her heart, a high-pitched whine that might have been terror or just her own broken nerves screaming into the emptiness.

She slid from her bunk, her socks whispering on the floor. The sound felt intimate, treasonous. Each step was a decision. The green floor-lights made the ceiling vanish into a pool of black oil. The sanctuary, once a haven of controlled sound, was now a vast, dark ear, and she was a discordant note walking through its canal.

This was her misophonia, inverted. It wasn't an assault now; it was a sonar. In this perfect, terrible quiet, every sound was a landmark, a warning, a revelation. The safe places were the voids of true silence. The dangerous places… they hummed.

She could hear it already. Not the Entity itself, but the spaces it had touched. Down the main corridor toward the mess hall, the silence had a different quality. It was a strained silence, a held breath. Beneath it, if she focused until her temples ached, was the faintest residue: a shimmering, atonal echo, like the ghost of a sound that had been consumed, leaving only a psychic stain. It was the auditory equivalent of a cold spot.

She had to find Leo. He was in Sector C, two corridors over, past the common room. A journey of forty meters in the old world. In this new dark, it was a pilgrimage through a minefield of noise.

Anya moved like a ghost, testing each footfall, placing her weight with agonizing slowness. She became a student of her own body, learning the language of its involuntary sounds. The creak of a knee joint. The gurgle of her stomach. She held h
