Chapter 7: A Symphony of Prey

Chapter 7: A Symphony of Prey

The silence that followed the power failure wasn’t empty. It was a held breath, a vacuum that pulled at the eardrums. In the absolute black of the lower-level corridor, Anya could hear the frantic, wet rhythm of her own heartbeat in her temples, the rustle of her sleeve as Leo gently pushed her behind him.

“The dagger,” he whispered, the words a brittle thing that barely traveled an inch before the dark swallowed them. “It’s drawn to its pulse. To any distinct sound.”

She understood. The plan was a suicide note, scrawled in noise. He would lead it away, a cacophonous diversion, while she used the ensuing chaos to find a way back to the surface, to warn someone. The logic was ice in her veins. The emotion was a scream trapped behind her teeth.

“Leo, no. There’s another way.”

“Name it,” he said, his voice soft. In the dark, she felt his hand find hers, squeeze once—a pulse of warmth, of finality. “We’re out of time. It’s in the vent above us. Listening.”

A faint, crystalline tink, like a wind chime made of glass needles, drifted from the ceiling. It was directly overhead.

Anya’s breath hitched. Leo’s hand left hers.

He took three running steps down the corridor, away from her, and slammed the metal handle of his flashlight against a pipe.

The clang was a physical violence in the silent world. It wasn’t just loud; it was a bright, jagged scar across the nothingness. It echoed, a dying man’s cry in a metal throat.

For a second, nothing.

Then, the ceiling vent above Anya groaned, its screws shearing with a sound like popping bones. Something heavy and impossibly fluid poured out of it, a waterfall of shadows and faint, refracted light. It didn’t land with a thud, but with a soft, pervasive shush, like a bag of fine sand settling.

It was between her and Leo.

She saw its outline against the faint emergency glow of a shattered bioluminescent strip further down the hall. Not a shape, but a suggestion of density, a standing wave of distorted air and faint, internal glimmers, like ice chips swirling in oil. At its core, the stolen sounds of its victims churned—a baby’s gurgle, a fragment of a radio tune, Dr. Vance’s final, wet gasp.

It ignored her. It turned towards the source of the clang.

Leo was already moving, a silhouette against a distant red exit sign. He didn’t run. He performed. He kicked a metal toolbox, sending a avalanche of wrenches and sockets clattering across the concrete. He yelled, not a word, but a raw, open-throated roar that filled the corridor.

The entity shifted. It seemed to drink the sound in, the glimmers at its core brightening. Then, it answered.

It mimicked the roar perfectly, but layered it—a chorus of Leo’s own voice, one a half-step higher, one a half-step lower, creating a dissonant chord that vibrated in Anya’s molars. It was a mockery, a correction.

Leo flinched but didn’t stop. He was leading it towards the central processing chamber, a vast space of pumps and filtration tanks they’d passed earlier—a reverberant cathedral of sound. He slapped his palm against every pipe, every railing, a frantic drummer beating a retreat.

The entity followed, a predator engaged in a terrible courtship. It didn’t just mimic now; it elaborated. When Leo’s footsteps echoed, the entity produced the echo a fraction of a second before the original sound faded, creating a confusing, overlapping stampede. When Leo grunted with effort, the entity harmonized, turning the grunt into a sickening, melodic sigh.

Anya forced her legs to move, creeping along the wall in the opposite direction, her own breathing a thunderous betrayal in her ears. She watched as Leo reached the giant iron door to the processing chamber. He threw it open with a scream of rusted hinges.

The entity paused at the threshold. For a moment, it was still. Then, it streamed inside after him, the door swinging shut, muffling the escalating sonic duel.

Silence rushed back, thicker now, polluted by the after-echoes. Anya was alone. The plan was working. She should run.

She found herself at the door, her ear pressed against the cold iron.

Inside, it had become a concert from a nightmare.

Leo was using everything. She heard the shatter of glass, the deep gong of a wrench against a massive water tank, his voice shouting, taunting, “Here! Over here, you silent bastard! Come on!”

The entity played along. It would repeat the sounds, then twist them. The glass shatter became a beautiful, cascading arpeggio. The wrench’s gong became a sustained, church-bell note that swelled until Anya felt the iron door tremble. It was learning, adapting, using the chamber’s acoustics as an instrument.

Then she heard it—the low, resonant thrum of the prototype dagger. Leo had activated it. The sound was a pure, steady tone, a beacon of sonic defiance.

The entity’s noise ceased.

The sudden quiet was more terrifying than the cacophony. It lasted three heartbeats.

A new sound emerged from the entity. A low, inverted vibration, a negative of the dagger’s pulse. It wasn’t loud. It was deep, a sub-bass rumble that Anya felt in the hollows of her hips, in the roots of her teeth. The two tones—the dagger’s thrum and the entity’s anti-thrum—met in the air.

And canceled each other out.

The dagger’s pulse stuttered, choked, and died. The silence that followed was absolute, dead, as if all sound had been surgically removed from the world.

Leo’s cry of disbelief was a tiny, human thing. “No… no!”

Anya’s hands were on the door handle. She was inside before she knew it.

The processing chamber was vast, a jungle of colossal cylindrical tanks, catwalks, and snaking pipes that rose into darkness. Moisture dripped with a slow, eternal rhythm. And in the center of the main gangway, under the pale glow of a single, swaying emergency light, stood Leo.

The entity filled the space before him. It was no longer a suggestion. Fed by the symphony of noise, it had grown more defined. She could see its surface now—a shifting, iridescent film, like a soap bubble the size of a van, reflecting the gloomy chamber in warped fragments. Within it, sounds moved like trapped fireflies: the clang of the pipe, the toolbox avalanche, Leo’s roar. It had captured them all.

Leo saw her. His face, pale and slick with sweat, contorted in rage and terror. “Anya! RUN!”

He turned back to the entity, empty-handed, weaponless. He did the only thing he had left. He filled his lungs and shouted. It was a wordless, primal sound, the sum of his fear, his courage, his love for her. It was Leo, distilled into a wave of pure, vulnerable noise.

The entity absorbed the shout. It shimmered, pleased.

Then, it played it back.

But not once. It looped it. It took the shout and stretched the first syllable into a groan. It took the middle and spliced it with a fragment of his earlier roar. It played the end first, then the beginning, creating a haunting, nonsensical palindrome of his voice. It was a funhouse mirror reflection of his soul, distorted, mocked, and beautified into something alien and horrifying.

Leo stumbled back, hands clapped over his ears, but the sound wasn’t just in the air; it was in the vibration of the catwalk, in the water in the tanks, inside his own skull.

He screamed again, a raw, broken thing.

The entity harmonized. It added a descant, a crystalline, angelic melody that wove around his scream, complementing it, completing it, turning his terror into a duet. Leo’s scream became the foundation, the bass note for the entity’s cruel, beautiful composition.

“Stop it!” Anya screamed, rushing forward.

The entity took no notice. It was enraptured with its partner. It advanced, not with a lunge, but with a slow, inevitable drift. The loop of Leo’s consumed sounds grew louder, layered, richer. She saw him shaking his head, his mouth open in a silent cry, his own voice used as a weapon to shatter his mind.

He fell to his knees on the metal grating.

The entity enveloped him.

It didn’t attack in a physical sense. It simply… integrated him. The iridescent film flowed over him, a slow, viscous wave. Leo’s final, choked gasp was captured before it even left his lips. Anya saw his silhouette inside the entity, thrashing for a moment, a fly in amber. Then, the thrashing slowed. His outline softened, blurred.

The sounds he was making—the grunts, the last beats of his heart, the rasp of his breath—were all plucked from him, added to the swirling symphony inside the bubble. His physical form seemed to dissolve into the medium of sound. His shape collapsed in on itself, not into bones or flesh, but into a dense, bright knot of auditory energy—a screaming core that joined the churning chorus.

Then, it was over. The entity, now pulsing with a stronger, more complex light, drifted back.

On the catwalk, where Leo had knelt, there was no blood, no body. Only a small, delicate deposit of crystalline residue, like frozen salt or tiny, perfect quartz filaments. It hummed faintly, playing a one-second, looping fragment of his final shout on a frequency almost too low to hear.

Anya stood frozen, empty. The world had been reduced to the drip of water and the faint, beautiful horror of the crystal’s hum.

The entity turned.

It didn’t have eyes, but she felt its attention settle on her like a pressure change. It had finished its duet. It was looking for a new instrument.

It began to drift toward her, silent save for the internal playback of its collection—Leo’s voice now a permanent part of its repertoire.

Anya backed away, a sob locked in her throat. She had no sound to make, no weapon to wield. She was silence and terror.

Then, she felt it.

A deep, internal twang, a vibration that came from inside her head. A faint, high-frequency whine, a sound she had lived with for a decade, the ghost-ringing of a thousand loud concerts—her tinnitus. It was always there, a private, sub-auditory hum at the edge of her perception.

The entity stopped.

Its surface shimmered, patterns swirling faster. It was listening to something she couldn’t even properly hear herself. It was tuning itself.

The hum in her ear changed. It subtly aligned, harmonizing with a new, external frequency that the entity was now emitting. A gentle, pulling resonance, deep in the labyrinth of her inner ear. It wasn’t painful. It was intimate. A perfect, silent match.

It was learning her signature. The unique, damaged frequency of her own auditory ghost.

It was starting to mimic her.
