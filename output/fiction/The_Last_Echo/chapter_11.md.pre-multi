Chapter 11: The Last Echo

The silence after the storm was the most terrifying sound Anya had ever heard.

It wasn’t true silence. True silence was a concept, a memory from before the world shrank to the thump of her own heart and the wet rasp of her breath. This was a listening silence. A held breath. The facility’s emergency lights cast long, skeletal shadows down the corridor, but they seemed to bleed a deeper darkness at their edges. The air was thick with the ozone stink of burnt wiring and the coppery tang of blood—Vance’s, mostly, but some of it hers, leaking from her ears where she’d jammed the last of her dampeners too deep in a desperate bid for a few more seconds of clarity.

She leaned against the cold concrete wall, the vibration of the dying generators a faint, sick tremor through her bones. Her hearing was a ruined landscape. The controlled sonic storm she’d unleashed in the reactor chamber—using the facility’s PA system, fire alarms, anything that could scream—had been a success. It had exposed the entity’s core, a pulsing, discordant knot of sound visible only as a shiver in the air, like heat haze over a corpse. It had also shattered the last of her defenses. Now, sound reached her as if through layers of wool and water, distorted, delayed, a ghost of itself. The world had become a silent film with a broken projector, the reel skipping, the images jarring and out of sync.

And the entity was learning.

A new sound began. It didn’t enter her ears so much as it materialized in the marrow of her teeth, in the cavity of her chest. It was a chorus. A wretched, beautiful, heart-stopping chorus of voices. She recognized them. The low, rumbling hum of Carl, the security guard who’d vanished from Sub-level Two. The bright, chirping laugh of Lily, the young intern who’d brought her coffee on her first day, now stretched into a keening wail of despair. Dozens of them, layered over one another, singing a wordless, agonized hymn. Dr. Vance’s smug baritone was there too, newly added, his fear sharpening his timbre into a serrated edge. The entity wasn’t just hunting now. It was performing. It was broadcasting the symphony of its consumption.

It was close. She could feel the pressure change, a subtle suck and push of air that made her eardrums ache despite their numbness. The chorus swelled, directionless, coming from the walls, the floor, the vents above. It was herding her. It had learned her hypersensitivity, learned that overwhelming her was less effective than teasing her, than using the remnants of her gift against her.

She stumbled away from the wall, her hand clenched around the broken hilt of the sonic dagger. The blade was gone, the emitter cracked, but a sliver of its resonant crystal remained, wedged into the handle. A single, final note. Her plan, born in the frantic seconds after she’d seen the core, was madness. A theory scrawled in the margins of Vance’s notes: To cancel a waveform, introduce its perfect inverse. Eq
