      "role": "Protagonist / Antagonist (initially)",
      "description": "A brilliant, wealthy, and ruthlessly logical futurist. He sees the apocalypse as a logistical puzzle to be solved and monetized. Emotionally detached, he values control and efficiency above all else. Sharp, pale, and intense.",
      "arc": "From a cold architect of controlled survival to someone who learns to embrace chaos, vulnerability, and love. His journey is one of humanization, moving from controlling a system to participating in a community."

      "role": "Protagonist / Catalyst",
      "description": "A structural botanist and ecological engineer. She was brought into the bunker for her skills, not her wealth. Practical, resilient, and deeply connected to organic life and human emotion. She represents everything Aris's system tries to exclude: unpredictability, dirt, and heart.",
      "arc": "From a trapped idealist fighting for scraps of humanity to a co-creator of a new future. She learns to temper her defiance with strategic patience and discovers the capacity to heal not just ecosystems, but a wounded human heart."

      "name": "Milo",
      "role": "Supporting Character",
      "description": "Aris's efficient, digitally loyal assistant. He represents the pinnacle of the bunker's ethos: compliant, data-driven, and devoid of challenging personal needs.",
      "arc": "Serves as a foil and a benchmark. May remain a symbol of the old system or show subtle signs of being affected by the changes Lyra and Aris undergo."

Through conflict, crisis, and vulnerability, they transition from rivals to reluctant allies, then to lovers.
