Chapter 5: Truce and Truths

The silence after the airlock hissed shut was a living thing. It wasn’t the empty quiet of before, but a thick, palpable stillness. It vibrated with the echo of the alarm, the memory of Aris’s grunt of pain, the ghost of Lyra’s hands fumbling with the sealant gun. The repair patch on the conduit gleamed under the work-lights, a silver scar on the bunker’s innards. They stood in the decontamination chamber, breathing hard, the scent of ozone and burnt metal clinging to their skinsuits.

Lyra peeled her helmet off. Her hair was plastered to her forehead with sweat that had nothing to do with the chamber’s heat. She watched Aris struggle with his own seal, his gloves slick with hydraulic fluid and a smudge of his own blood from a gash on his knuckle. Without a word, she stepped forward, batted his trembling hands away, and released the catches with a practiced twist. His helmet came free with a soft pop.

His face was pale, his eyes wide. Not with fear, she realized, but with a residual, electric shock. They had almost died. Not in the abstract, future-tense way of surface storms, but in the immediate, metallic taste of vacuum.

“Your hand,” she said, her voice raspy.

He looked at it as if seeing it for the first time. “It’s nothing. A scrape.”

“In here, nothing is nothing.” She rummaged in a wall compartment and pulled out the small med-kit. “Sit.”

To her surprise, he didn’t argue. He sank onto the bench bolted to the wall, his shoulders slumping. Lyra sat beside him, not close, but closer than they’d been without hostility. She cleaned the cut, the antiseptic wipe leaving a stark white trail on his grimy skin. The bunker hummed around them, a sound so constant it was usually forgotten, but now it felt like a grateful purr.

“You knew the bypass protocol,” he said, not looking at her.

“My father taught me. Farm equipment is less forgiving than this, but the principle’s the same.” She applied a dermal seal. “You… you didn’t freeze. When the secondary valve blew.”

“Panic is a luxury for people with time,” he muttered, flexing his bandaged hand. “I’ve never had much of that.”

They sat in the humming quiet. The unspoken thing hung between them: You saved my life. I saved yours.

“Truce?” Lyra said finally, the word feeling strange on her tongue.

Aris met her gaze. The perpetual defensiveness was still there, but it was cracked, revealing sheer exhaustion underneath. “Truce,” he agreed. “At least until our heart rates return to normal.”

It was a start.

The truce showed itself in small, cautious territories of peace. The first was the meal. That evening, instead of retreating to their separate halves with their ration packs, Lyra was heating a packet of synthetic bean stew on her hotplate. The smell, vaguely earthy and salty, filled the cramped space. Aris was methodically rehydrating a brick of nutrient pasta on his side. The silence was no longer aggressive, but it was heavy, loaded with the memory of shared air.
