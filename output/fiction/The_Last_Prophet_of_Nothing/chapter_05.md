Chapter 5: Witch-Hunt and Broken Oaths

Chapter 5: Witch-Hunt and Broken Oaths

The rain was a grey, needling insistence, washing the color from the world and the warmth from Elara’s bones. It plastered her stolen pilgrim’s cloak to her skin and turned the forest track into a sucking, clay mire that clung to her boots with every desperate step. For three days she had moved like a ghost, avoiding roads, eating bitter roots and the last hard crust of stolen bread. The Spire of Dawn was a golden bruise on the horizon behind her, but its reach was longer than its shadow. Her face, once rendered in serene stained glass, now stared back from weathered wanted notices nailed to rain-swollen tree trunks. Elara of Mossgrove. The Unmaker. Traitor to the Dawn. Heretic of the Highest Order. Reward: Ten Thousand Solar Crowns.

The title ‘Prophet’ was conspicuously absent. They had un-made her, too.

Mossgrove. The name was a talisman, a final, fragile hope clenched in her heart. The village was a backwater, a cluster of thatch and fieldstone huddled where the Greatwood thinned into pasture. The Temple’s eye would be upon it, of course—their eye was upon everything now—but perhaps, in the shadowed familiarity of home, she could find a crack. A forgotten root-cellar, a sympathetic glance from a face she’d known since childhood. Her mother’s hands, rough from the loom, pulling her inside. Her father’s silence, which had always been a shelter, not a judgment.

She crested the final hill as dusk bled into the wet earth. The sight below stopped her breath.

Mossgrove was occupied. Not by soldiers in passing, but transformed. The village green, where she had danced at the Summer Solstice, now held a stark wooden watchtower, its timbers still raw and yellow against the grey. A banner of the Dawn—a sun pierced by a silver spire—hung sodden from the eaves of the alehouse. Temple knights in polished, rain-beaded plate stood at the crossroads, their presence a wrong, geometric shape against the organic slump of cottages. The air, even from this distance, smelled wrong: less of woodsmoke and baking bread, more of cold iron, wet wool, and the faint, cloying scent of sanctified incense trying to mask the mud.

Her family’s cottage, at Oakhaven’s edge where the garden met the wild, was dark. No candle glowed in the window. But the door was shut, the thatch intact. It was something.

Elara waited for full dark, the rain her only ally. She moved not as the Prophet she had been, nor the weapon the heretics wanted her to be, but as the girl she once was, slipping through the hedgerow at the bottom of the garden where the blackberries grew thick. The earth here knew her weight. The back door’s latch was still stubborn; a lift and a sharp shove to the left. It groaned open.

The smell of home hit her like a blow: dried herbs, yeast, the faint, permanent scent of the peat fire. It was dark and still.

“Mother?” she whispered, the word rusted from disuse.

A flint struck. A candle bloomed, and in its sudden, jumping light, she saw them. Her father, Tomas, stood before the cold hearth, his hands clenched at his sides, not opening for an embrace. Her mother, Lira, sat at the table, her face a mask of anguish carved by the flickering shadows. And between them, wide-eyed and trembling, was her younger brother, Kellen. He was taller, his boyish softness hardening. He did not smile.

“Elara.” Her father’s voice was a graveled thing, worn thin. “You should not be here.”

“I had nowhere else to go,” she said, the plea laid bare. She pushed back her hood. Her mother gasped, a sharp intake of air. She saw not her daughter, but the fugitive, the hollow-cheeked wretch with wild eyes and mud caked under her nails.

“They said you… you destroyed a holy place,” Lira said, her voice trembling. “That you touched the source of the Dawn’s grace and made it… nothing. They say you want to unmake the world.”

“They lie,” Elara said, the heresy now her truth. “The grace is a lie. The Dawn is a cage. It’s all a sickness, Mother. A beautiful, terrible sickness. I’ve seen the truth.”

“Truth?” Her father took a step forward, his big frame blocking the light. “The truth is our neighbors look at us with fear. The truth is Elder Jorin was taken for questioning because he blessed you as a child. The truth is Kellen cannot apprentice with the carpenter because his sister is a heretic.” He spat the word as if it were poison on his tongue. “They promise divine retribution, Elara. Not just on you. On us. On Mossgrove. A blight on the fields, a withering of the herd. They say your sin is a contagion.”

Kellen found his voice, thin and reedy. “Did you really do it? Did you kill the light?”

She looked at him, this boy she had taught to skip stones on the pond. “I broke a thing that was hurting everyone, even if they couldn’t feel the hurt. I am trying to cure us.”

“We don’t want your cure!” her mother cried, finally standing. Tears tracked through the weary lines of her face. “We want our daughter back. The one who wove the finest thread, who had a laugh like the brook in spring. Not this… this hollow thing speaking madness. Go to them. Beg forgiveness. The Prophet Ascendant is merciful.”

Elara felt something inside her crack, a final levee giving way. This was the true unmaking. Not the silent, terrifying negation of the Wellspring, but this slow, visceral tearing of every bond that had ever held her to the world. The opulence of the Spire had been suffocating, but this was annihilation.

“There is no mercy in the preservation of a lie,” she said, her voice flat, dead. “Only the prolonging of the disease.”

“Then go,” her father said, his face crumbling into a landscape of grief and terror. “If you love us at all, you will go. And never return. You are dead to us. It is the only way we live.”

The words were the final, physical blow. She staggered back a step, the warmth of the cottage now a freezing vacuum. She looked from her father’s shattered resolve to her mother’s desperate, weeping face, to Kellen’s confused horror. They were her first world, and it had just dissolved into nothing.

She turned and fumbled for the door latch.

“Wait.”

It was her mother. Elara paused, a foolish, desperate hope flaring. Lira hurried to the cupboard, pulled out a wrapped bundle. She thrust it into Elara’s hands. It was hard, dense. Travel bread, a wedge of cheese. Not an embrace, not absolution. Provisions for a stranger. A final duty.

Elara took it, her fingers numb. She met her mother’s eyes and saw only a terrified woman saving her household. The daughter was already gone.

“Goodbye,” Elara whispered, to all of them, and to the girl she had been.

She melted back into the rain and the night, the food in her hands a heavier burden than any chains. She would not get far on the roads. She needed to cut through the Greatwood, to lose herself in its ancient, dripping depths. There was a place—a hunter’s blind, a half-rotten platform in an old oak where she and…

Beren. Her childhood friend. Her accomplice in every childhood adventure. He would be at his father’s smithy, at Oakhaven’s heart. It was a risk, but Beren had a heart that laughed at rules. He had taught her to swim, to swear, to skip flat stones. If anyone in this world still held a fragment of the past untainted by Temple fear, it was him. She could warn him, get directions, perhaps even see a flicker of the old recognition in a human face.

It was a catastrophic error.

She found him not at the smithy, but leaving the alehouse, his broad shoulders hunched against the rain. She hissed his name from the alley beside the tannery, where the stink of chemicals and rot was overwhelming.

He jumped, peering into the gloom. “Who’s—?” His eyes adjusted. She saw the journey on his face: shock, a fleeting, incredible joy, and then a slow, chilling dawning of reality. The wanted posters. The sermons. The knights in his village.

“Elara? By the burning dawn, it is you.” He stepped closer, but not to embrace her. His eyes darted over her shoulder. “You’re mad to come here. They’re everywhere.”

“I know. I’m leaving. I just… I needed to see a friendly face.” The admission was pathetic.

His expression softened, and for a second, he was the boy who’d shared his last apple with her. “You look half-drowned. Come on, the old hayloft in my da’s barn. It’s dry. I’ll get you some proper food.”


The scent of damp earth and crushed ferns clung to the air as Elara crouched in the underbrush, her breath shallow. The village was a smudge of smoke and ruin ahead, the thatch roofs collapsed like broken wings. She had known the Spire would come, but seeing it—seeing the blackened beams of her father’s loom, the charred remnants of her mother’s garden—was a blade twisting in her ribs.

A twig snapped. She froze.

“You’re not one of them,” a voice rasped from the shadows. A boy, no older than twelve, stepped forward, his face smudged with soot. His eyes were too knowing for his years.

Elara’s fingers tightened around the dagger at her belt. “No,” she said. “I’m not.”

The boy tilted his head, studying her. “Then why are you here?”

She exhaled, the weight of the question pressing down. “To see what’s left.”

The boy’s gaze flicked to the ruins, then back to her. “Nothing,” he said. “They took everything.”

Elara swallowed the ache in her throat. “Not everything.”

The boy’s fingers brushed the empty space where a locket might have hung. “No,” he whispered. “Not everything.”

The wind carried the scent of ash and something else—something raw and human. Grief. Survival. The boy’s hand trembled as he reached for hers.

Elara let him take it.

It was the kindness she was starved for. She followed him, a drowning woman clutching at rotten wood. The barn was dark, fragrant with dry hay and old wood. He helped her up the ladder. “Wait here. Don’t make a sound.”

He was gone for a long time. The rain drummed on the roof. The hay prickled her skin. She ate some of her mother’s bread, each mouthful ash.

When the barn door creaked open again, it was not Beren’s solitary step she heard, but the synchronized, heavy tread of plate armor on packed earth.

Her heart froze, then plummeted.

A lantern flared, blinding her. She scrambled back against the hay.

“There,” said Beren’s voice, thick with something that was not quite guilt, not quite triumph. “As I said, Captain.”

Three Temple knights filled the space below, their armor gleaming in the lantern light. The lead knight, his helm crested with a sunburst, looked up at her. “Elara, the Unmaker. In the name of the Spire of Dawn, you are bound for judgment.”

Beren stood beside him, not meeting her eyes. “I’m sorry, Ela,” he mumbled, to the earth, not to her. “It’s the reward… my da’s sick. The tithes… we’d lose the smithy. They promised they wouldn’t… they promised mercy.”

The knight placed a heavy, gauntleted hand on Beren’s shoulder. “You have served the Dawn, boy. Your village will be blessed for this.”

Elara looked at her friend, at the shame and desperate avarice twisting his features. The last thread snapped. A profound cold settled over her, deeper than the rain, more absolute than the dark.

“Mercy,” she echoed, the word a hollow stone.

She stood. The knights tensed, hands going to sword hilts. They had been trained to combat mages, to disrupt flows of energy, to counter fire, ice, force. They had no doctrine for what she was.

“Do not resist,” the Captain commanded. “Your power is an abomination, but it is of the world. We can contain it.”

“You misunderstand,” Elara said, her voice empty of everything. “I am not resisting.”

She didn’t summon. She didn’t weave. She simply reached—not for power, but for the silent, screaming nullity that had lived in her since the Spire, the truth the heretics had shown her. She touched the fabric of the world around her—the vibrant, interconnected web of existence that was the “sickness”—and in one focused point, she revoked.

It was not an explosion. It was an erasure.

A sphere of perfect silence bloomed from her outstretched hand, expanding to envelop the three knights. Where it touched, reality ceased. The clangor of armor, the hiss of rain, the scent of hay and iron—all were swallowed into an instant of absolute void. The knights did not scream; sound was unmade before it could leave their throats. Their polished plate did not melt or shatter; it simply wasn’t, along with the flesh, bone, and life it contained. One moment they were there, symbols of divine order. The next, there was only a smooth, bowl-shaped depression in the packed earth of the barn floor, six inches deep, its edges glassy and fused as if by impossible heat. No ash, no blood. Only nothing.

Beren stood at the edge of the void, untouched physically. He stared at the place where the captain’s hand had been on his shoulder. He looked at the smooth, empty pit. His mind, unable to process the absolute negation, broke. A thin, high whine escaped his lips, then a shuddering wail. He turned and ran, stumbling, screaming into the night, “Witch! UNMAKER!”

The commotion would bring the entire garrison. Elara climbed down, her limbs moving with a strange, automaton precision. She walked out of the barn. The rain fell through the hole she had made in the roof, pattering into the perfect, empty bowl.

She walked not into the woods, but back through Oakhaven, towards the hill. Knights were converging, torches bobbing like angry fireflies. Shouts echoed. They saw her, a lone, sodden figure moving with terrible purpose.

“Halt!”

She didn’t halt. She extended a hand towards the watchtower on the green. Another silent, expanding sphere of negation. The raw timbers, the banner, the two archers inside—all vanished. The structure above the erased section collapsed with a splintering crash.

Pandemonium. Now there was fear, pure and undiluted. This was not magic as they knew it. This was a blasphemy against existence itself.

She kept walking, up the hill to her family’s cottage. It was dark, silent. They were hiding inside, praying to their gods that the monster would pass them by.

Elara looked at the thatch roof, the garden her mother tended, the bee skep her father had built. This was the anchor. This was the last weight on the chain tethering her to Elara of Mossgrove.

She raised both hands.

She did not unmake the cottage. She unmade the ground upon which it stood.

A larger, slower wave of negation swept out. Not a clean sphere, but a creeping, voracious tide. Where it passed, the vibrant green of the garden turned to a uniform, lifeless grey powder. The flowers, the vegetables, the very soil and its teeming, secret life—gone. The foundation stones of the cottage crumbled into inert, mineral dust. The structure groaned, listed, and collapsed in on itself with a soft, sighing roar, swallowed by the expanding circle of grey.

From the edge of the dead zone, she heard a single, shattered scream. Her mother’s. She did not turn.

The knights had stopped pursuing. They stood at the tree line, a line of terrified metal and flesh, witnessing the birth of a new kind of terror.

Elara turned to face what was left of her village, standing at the epicenter of the spreading, magic-dead ashes of her past. The rain fell on the grey dust, turning it to a slick, paste-like mud that would never grow a single blade of grass. The cold inside her was complete now, a perfect, still clarity. The heretics spoke of a Cure for reality. She was not a physician. She was the terminal diagnosis, made manifest.

She let the silence hang, heavy and absolute, broken only by the distant, weeping wind and the crackle of the last burning timbers from the green.

She spoke then, not to the knights, not to the hidden, trembling villagers, but to the empty, uncaring air, to the universe itself, her voice the dry rustle of finality.

“Let them call me the Prophet of Nothing.”

She looked at her hands, the instruments of the world’s undoing.

“I will make it true.”
