Chapter 8: The Armies of Light

They called it the Plain of Sighs. A vast, wind-scoured basin between the jagged teeth of the Kaelen Mountains and the whispering forests of the Verdant See. It was here the world chose to make its stand. From the vantage of a cracked basalt outcrop, Elara watched the Armies of Light assemble, and the sight was a beautiful, terrible poison.

Sunlight glinted off ranked pike-heads, a silver fungus sprouting across the brown earth. Banners of a hundred hues snapped in the dry wind—the golden sun of the Solar Throne, the silver flame of the Pyromancer’s Collegium, the intertwined serpents of the Hydra Cult. Siege engines, carved from enchanted wood and humming with contained force, were hauled into position by teams of oxen with hides like polished stone. In the skies, shapes circled: griffin-riders of the High Reaches, and the great, shimmering forms of battle-mages testing the air currents, their very passage painting rainbows in their wake. The air tasted of ozone, incense, and the sharp tang of fear-sweat from the men packed like cordwood below.

It was a tapestry of creation’s pride. It was the funeral shroud of meaning.

Beside her, Kaelen spat a glob of phlegm onto the rock. His face, once that of a minor functionary in the Citadel of Whispers, was now a roadmap of scars and simmering rage. “A festival,” he grunted, his voice raspy from shouting orders to their rabble. “They’ve come for a celebration of their own power. They’ll sing of this for ages.”

“They’ll sing of nothing,” Elara said, her own voice flat. It surprised her, that flatness. Inside, a cold, dense star had formed, compressing her grief, her guilt, her old love for the shimmering world below into an inert weight. “The songs will die in their throats.”

Her army—the grandly named “Army of the Mundane”—was a stain on the edge of that glorious tapestry. Five thousand souls, maybe. Refugees from her systematic dismantling of waystones and ley-line nexuses, heretics who’d whispered of godless worlds, mercenaries who fought for the coin she’d looted from emptied sanctums, and the ragged remnants of the Cult of the Silent Word. They had no banners. Their armor was a patchwork of leather, scavenged plate, and hardened linen. Their weapons were sharpened farm tools, hunting bows, and a stubborn, desperate fury. They stank of unwashed bodies and campfire smoke. They were the echo of the world before magic, and they looked upon the splendor arrayed against them with a kind of weary hatred.

“They have the ground, the sky, the gods,” murmured Lira, a former water-diviner whose magic had been the first thing Elara’s presence had extinguished in her, years ago. She now served as a scout, her eyes still preternaturally sharp. “They have everything.”

“They have everything to lose,” Elara corrected, turning from the vista. “We have nothing. That is our ground. That is our sky.”

The strategy was simple, born of a horrific, inverse logic. She would let them bring it all.
