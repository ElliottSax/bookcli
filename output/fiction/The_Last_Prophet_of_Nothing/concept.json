  "premise": "A young woman is violently anointed as the world's prophesied savior, only to discover the celestial 'gods' she is meant to serve are cosmic parasites, and her true destiny is not to fulfill the prophecy, but to starve them by extinguishing all magic forever. To save humanity, she must become the ultimate villain, systematically dismantling the very source of her own power and making enemies of every kingdom, mage, and divine being that depends on it. Her only allies are a heretical cult that believes salvation lies in a silent, mundane world\u2014a fate many would consider worse than death.",
  "protagonist": "Elara, a reluctant conduit of immense magical power who feels the agonizing 'hunger' of the gods every time she uses it.",
