Chapter 6: The Mage-Killer's Gambit

The air in the sewers beneath Valerius wasn't just foul; it was a thick, tactile presence. It coated the tongue with the taste of rust and forgotten meals, pressed against the skin with a clammy, insistent weight. Elara moved through it like a phantom, her boots making soft, sucking sounds in the sludge. The only light came from the faint, greenish glow of the null-moss she’d cultivated in a jar, a substance that drank luminescence rather than emitted it. It was her first true tool, a gift from the heretics. In its gloom, her own hands looked like the hands of a corpse.

Above, the city thrummed with a vitality she was learning to hate. It was a sound felt in the teeth: the low hum of ley-lines channeled through public conduits, the shimmering chimes of warding spells on noble manors, the distant, crystalline laughter from the Spire’s floating gardens. A symphony of theft. Every note was stolen from the silent, bleeding heart of the world, processed through human souls, and offered up to the distant, hungry mouths of the gods. Her family’s faces, twisted with pious horror as they barred their door, flashed behind her eyes. They were part of the mechanism. They had to be.

Her target was the Conclave of the Azure Veil, meeting tonight in the sub-basilica of the Grand Orrery. The most powerful mages in the region, gathered to calibrate the celestial engines that regulated the flow of magic for a hundred leagues. They were the engineers of the starvation. To starve the gods, you didn't just attack the banquet table; you had to poison the kitchens, break the plumbing, salt the fields.

She found the grate exactly where the disgraced alchemist said it would be. Kaelen’s face was a roadmap of old burns and deeper regrets, his eyes the color of tarnished silver. He’d been cast out of the Spire for asking “impious questions” about magical decay. His price wasn't gold, but her notes on the null-substance’s effects. A transaction of mutual damnation.

“They focus their power through the Orrery’s central prism,” he’d whispered, his voice like grinding glass. “A masterwork of sung crystal. Pour this on its apex.” He’d handed her a vial of something that felt like a void in her palm, cold and lightless. “It won’t shatter it. It will make it… forget what it is.”

Elara pried the grate open, the iron screeching a protest swallowed by the dripping dark. The passage beyond was tight, stone worn smooth by centuries of effluence. She crawled, the vial a heavy secret against her chest. The memory of the minor wellspring’s death throes came back to her—not an explosion, but a sigh, a letting-go, a patch of world falling into a profound and peaceful sleep. This would be louder.

She emerged into a maintenance closet, fragrant with oil and ozone. Through a crack in the door, she saw the sub-basilica. It was a vaulted chamber of black marble, dominated by the Grand Orrery itself. It w
