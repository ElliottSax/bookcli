Chapter 1: The Crimson Anointing

The smell of crushed feverfew and damp earth was the only truth Elara trusted. It was a simple, honest scent, clinging to her fingers and the rough linen of her apron as she worked in the fading light. Outside her hut, the village of Oakhaven prepared for the God-Tear, a celestial event the temple calendar called a blessing. Elara called it a nuisance. It meant closing the shutters early, herding the skittish goats, and listening to old man Parth hold forth on omens. All while her real work—the tincture for Millie’s cough, the poultice for Jorn’s swollen joint—lay unfinished.

“Elara! They’re starting!” Her younger brother, Kael, burst in, his eyes wide with excitement he hadn’t yet learned to temper. At ten, he still believed in spectacle.

“In a moment,” she murmured, using a pestle to grind willow bark finer. The rhythmic crunch-crunch was a prayer against chaos.

“But the sky’s already changing!”

She sighed, wiping her hands. “Alright. But we watch from the ridge. Not the square.” The square meant the priest’s droning liturgy, the press of bodies, the expectation of awe. The ridge meant cold air, solitude, and a quick retreat.

They slipped out, Kael pulling her by the wrist. The village was a tapestry of firelight and long shadows, everyone turned upward. On the ridge, the wind carried the scent of pine and woodsmoke. Above, the familiar constellations began to smear, as if a great thumb had dragged across the wet ink of the night. The God-Tear. Not a star falling, but the heavens themselves bleeding a slow, luminous wound.

At first, it was beautiful. A shimmering veil of argent light, gossamer and serene. Kael gasped, pointing. Elara felt a faint, unwelcome stirring in her chest, a warmth that had nothing to do with the chill air. She ignored it. She was Elara the herbalist, the mender of broken things, not a gawker at sky-fire.

Then the color changed.

The silver blushed, then deepened to the hue of a fresh bruise. Then to rose. Then to a glaring, violent crimson. The light falling upon Oakhaven was no longer celestial milk; it was a downpour of blood. The world was submerged in a butcher’s glow. Faces upturned in wonder became grotesque masks. The thatched roofs steamed as if freshly scalded. The village well looked like a pit of gore.

“Elara…?” Kael’s voice was small. He clutched her arm.

A wave of heat passed through her, not external, but erupting from her marrow. It was a wrongness, a violation. She stumbled back, a cry strangled in her throat. Her skin prickled, then burned. She looked at her hands, and in the hellish light, she saw them. Lines, fine as spider-silk at first, then rising into welts, glowing from within as if her veins had been replaced with molten copper. They spiraled up her wrists, a script of agony writing itself onto her flesh.

“What’s on your face?” Kael whispered, terrified.

She touched her cheek. The skin was raised, searing. She could feel the pattern now, crawling.
