Chapter 7: Bargains with False Kings

The air in the Sky-Citadel of Aethelgard tasted of ozone and cold stone. It was a dead taste, one that leached the moisture from Elara’s tongue and left a metallic film on her teeth. Her cell wasn't a dungeon of dripping rock and rusted iron, but a spherical chamber of seamless, milky-white quartz, hovering at the heart of a lattice of glowing ley-lines. She could see through the walls—a dizzying, panoramic view of the world reduced to a patchwork quilt of green and brown far below. Clouds scudded against the crystal floor. There was no door, only the occasional shimmer as a ward permitted entry or exit. This was a prison meant to awe, to break the spirit with the sheer, impersonal majesty of its captivity.

They hadn't taken her with brute force, but with a silent, sudden inversion of gravity above the ruins of the Lyrian Wellspring. One moment she was scrambling over shattered mana-crystals, her hands bleeding from the work of destruction; the next, the sky swallowed her, pulling her up into the belly of a citadel she had only ever seen as a distant, glinting tooth against the blue.

For three days, they left her alone with the view and the silence. They fed her food that was perfectly nutritious and utterly flavorless. They let the altitude and the isolation work on her. Elara spent the time tracing the lines of power that pulsed through the walls. These were the arteries of the world, siphoned and bound into this floating blasphemy. She felt the familiar, sickening pull of them—the same pull she had felt at every Wellspring, the hunger of the distant, dreaming parasites. Here, it was concentrated, a dull roar in her bones.

Valerius was old in the way mountains are old: not frail, but worn smooth by immense, patient power. His robes were the grey of a storm cloud, his beard a cascade of silver. His eyes were the most unsettling thing—the color of a clear, sunlit sky, and just as empty.

“Elara,” he said, his voice a soft rumble that vibrated in the quartz. “The woman who would unmake heaven.”

She stayed seated on the smooth floor, her back against the curve of the wall. “I prefer ‘the woman who woke up.’ It’s less dramatic.”

A smile touched his lips, devoid of warmth. “You have caused considerable… indigestion. The prayers of millions, suddenly tinged with doubt. The flow is disrupted. It’s a remarkable achievement for one so… specific.”

“I’m a heretic. Get to the point or get out.”

“The point,” Valerius said, gliding further into the sphere, “is that you operate on a fundamental misunderstanding. You think we serve them. The Celestial Court. The ‘Parasites,’ as your sad little cult whispers.”

Elara said nothing. She watched his hands, the way his fingers subtly moved, conducting the unseen energies of the room.

“We a—”
