Chapter 5: Ghost in the Machine

Chapter 5: Ghost in the Machine

The silence in Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne Thorne’s quarters was a physical thing. It pressed against his eardrums, a low hum that was the facility’s circulatory system—ventilation, distant generators, the whisper of filtered air scrubbing away any organic scent. It was the sound of a tomb pretending to be alive. Since the confrontation in the observation gallery, he’d been marinating in that silence for eighteen hours. No summons from Kaelen, no visit from the icy Dr. Soren. Just isolation. A tactic, he knew. Let the doubt they’d planted in him—stress-induced paranoia, synaptic feedback, suggestibility—take root and flower into genuine uncertainty.

But the memory of Subject Alpha’s eyes, those lucid, terrified pools in the ruined face, refused to compost into doubt. It had fossilized into a certainty harder than diamond. They had lied. The question was the scale of it.

The terminal on his Spartan desk glowed, a rectangle of sterile light in the dark. His authorized access was a gilded cage. He could review the Lazarus Project’s published logs, the sanitized data streams of Alpha’s vitals, the triumphantly bland reports of “cognitive reintegration.” It was all narrative. He needed the subtext.

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne cracked his knuckles, a sound like breaking icicles in the quiet. He began not with the project files, but with the facility’s architectural and network schematics—dry, technical data even a paranoid security AI might consider benign. He mapped the dataflow, not as a user, but as a plumber. He traced the pipes. The Prometheus Biotechnics research facility was arrogant; their internal firewalls were formidable against external attacks, but internally, they relied on segmentation and privilege tiers. And Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne, as the neural cartographer, had been given a master key to the brain of the operation. They just hadn’t expected him to copy it and start trying it in every lock in the house.

His first probe was a ghost-walk through the personnel server. He wasn’t looking for Lazarus’s project file; he was looking for his procurement file. How did a subject become a subject? The answer was in Logistics. A shipping manifest, buried under layers of mundane supply orders: Subject Acquisition: Transfer from Municipal Cold Storage, Metropolis-7. Authorization: The Prometheus Biotechnics research facility Clearance 9. Designation: Unclaimed Remains – John Doe. Cause of Cataloguing: Traumatic Impact/Asphyxiation.

John Doe. A man with a voice, with memories, reduced to “Unclaimed Remains.”

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne felt a cold slick of sweat between his shoulder blades. He created a mirrored shell within the system, a false directory that would, he hoped, absorb any routine integrity checks. Then he dove deeper, into the morgue of archived identities. The “John Doe” tag had a digital corpse-tag linked to it: a scrambled police report from three years prior. The encryption was military-grade, a snarling knot of code. But it had a flaw—it was old. And Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne had spent the last five years of his life learning to untangle the snarled synapses of damaged minds. This was just a different kind of scar tissue.

He wrote a decryption algorithm based on a known The Prometheus Biotechnics research facility cipher, one he’d seen in the neural mapping software. It was like using a master key to fashion a lockpick. The system resisted, throwing up error flags that flashed amber in the corner of his screen. He routed them into his mirrored shell, watching them pile up like silent alarms in a bank vault he was already inside. His heart was a frantic bird against his ribs. The air in the room seemed to thicken, to taste of ozone and dread.

The file unfolded.

The name hit him with the force of a physical blow: Leo Vance.

Attached was a photograph. Not a morgue shot, but a press ID. A man in his late thirties, with intelligent, crinkled eyes and a mouth that looked like it was used to smiling, but warily. His hair was tousled. He looked alive. Terribly, vibrantly alive.

Occupation: Investigative Journalist, The Sentinel Chronicle.

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s breath fogged the screen. He scrolled, fingers numb. The redacted police report was now clear. Leo Vance’s body had been found in a derelict industrial zone on the outskirts of Metropolis-7. Official cause: a fall from a height. Multiple fractures, cranial trauma. Closed case: accident. But the unredacted notes, the ones meant for no one, told a different story. Vance had been working on a story about “biotech overreach.” His last known communication, to his editor, read: “The Prometheus Biotechnics research facility isn’t just playing God. They’re auditioning for the role of Devil. The Thanatos Project is real. I have a source.”

Thanatos.

The word sat on the screen, pulsing with malevolence. Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s mouth was desert-dry. He cross-referenced it internally. Zero results. A ghost. He opened a new search, this time targeting the high-security research logs, the ones indexed under codes only the upper echelon could access. He used Leo Vance’s name as a key, then “Thanatos,” then strings of code from the Lazarus project itself. The system pushed back. Warnings flashed red now, not amber. He was in the sanctum.

A log entry, dated four years ago, appeared. Project: THANATOS. Headed by Dr. Elias Kaelen. Objective: Development of a targeted, aerosol-based neuro-pathogen capable of inducing irreversible apoptosis in specific neural clusters associated with higher cognitive function—particularly ethical reasoning and communal empathy.

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne read it twice. The clinical language did nothing to dampen the horror. A weapon that didn’t kill the body, but murdered the conscience. It left a functioning human being—a soldier, a citizen—bereft of moral compass, perfectly obedient, incapable of guilt. A slave in all but name.

The log entries progressed. Successes in simian trials. Then, a catastrophic containment breach in a sub-level lab. One technician exposed. The description was chilling: Subject exhibited rapid degradation of social inhibition, followed by hyper-aggression, then a complete emotional catatonia. Physiological systems remained nominal. Autopsy revealed targeted necrotization of the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex.

They had created a monster. And lost control of it.

The final entry on Thanatos was an executive order. Project terminated. All samples to be incinerated. All data quarantined under Clearance Sigma.

But The Prometheus Biotechnics research facility didn’t throw things away. They repurposed.

With trembling hands, Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne pulled up the foundational genome sequences of the Lazarus Strain. He split his screen, placing them beside the recovered fragments of the Thanatos pathogen’s code. He didn’t need a bio-informatics AI to see it. The Lazarus Strain was a twisted mirror image. Where Thanatos used a viral vector to induce targeted cellular death, Lazarus used a nearly identical, engineered retrovirus to reverse it. It wasn’t a therapy born of humanitarian ambition. It was a salvage operation. They had taken their most horrific mistake and tried to re-engineer it into a miracle. Leo Vance had stumbled into the heart of this. And he had “fallen.”

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s head swam. The claustrophobic walls of his room seemed to pulse inward, breathing with him, a giant lung of metal and lies. He thought of Elara Vance Vance, her voice on the comms—strained, hopeful, grieving. “Can you save him?” She believed her brother had just died. A recent tragedy. Not a three-year-old secret buried under layers of murder and weaponized science.

He accessed the communication logs. Found the encrypted pipeline to Elara Vance. Traced its security. It was a one-way drip feed, carefully crafted. The Prometheus Biotechnics research facility was feeding her a story, using her grief as both a motivator for Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne and a leash. She was in the dark, a pawn mourning a ghost who had been a ghost for years before his body was even cold.

The pieces locked together with a soundless, devastating click. The resurrection trial wasn’t a test of a new therapy. It was a desperate, live-fire experiment to see if they could fix their cover-up. Leo Vance knew too much. He died for it. But his body, his brain, preserved in cold storage, became an opportunity. If they could bring him back, they could control the narrative, or at the very least, ensure the secrets in his mind truly died. Only their weapon had worked too well. It hadn’t just repaired tissue; it had reignited the man, memories and conscience intact. Lazarus had risen, and the first thing he did was point a trembling finger at his murderers.

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne sat back, the chair groaning. The glow of the terminal was the only light in a world gone pitch black. He felt no triumph, only a crushing, icy weight. He was in the belly of the beast, and he had just read its DNA. And they knew he was suspicious.

A new urgency, sharp as a scalpel, cut through his paralysis. He had to get the data out. He had to reach Elara Vance. He began copying files, compressing them into a data packet small enough to piggyback on an outgoing diagnostic signal he’d identified earlier—a routine systems check sent to a The Prometheus Biotechnics research facility satellite every six hours. He set the packet to burst-transmit in ninety seconds, aimed at a dead-drop server he maintained under a false identity. It was a slim chance.

Forty-five seconds to transmission. He wiped his access trails, collapsing his mirrored shell, erasing his digital footprints with the care of a forensic cleaner.

A soft, incongruous chime echoed in the room. His personal comms light blinked—an internal call. The ID was blocked.

He stared at it, blood turning to ice in his veins. Acceptance would buy time. Ignition would be an admission of guilt.

Twenty seconds.

He accepted the call. “Thorne.”

“Dr. Aris Thorne.” It was Kaelen’s voice, smooth as polished bone. “You’re working late. The neural rest cycle is important. Even for minds as robust as yours.”

“Couldn’t sleep,” Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne said, forcing his voice into a weary flatness. He watched the counter on his screen: 10… 9… “The Alpha subject. It’s… unsettling.”

“Indeed. Which is why I’d like you to join me in the main lab. I’ve been reviewing your mapping data. There are… anomalies I’d like to discuss. In person.” The request was a velvet glove around an iron fist.

5… 4…

“Now?” Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne asked.

“Now is always the best time for clarity, don’t you think?” A pause. “Is everything alright, Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne? You sound strained.”

2… 1… TRANSMISSION BURST COMPLETE.

A wave of nauseating relief washed over him, followed immediately by a sharper terror. The data was away. A ghost in the machine, fleeing the tomb.

“I’m fine,” he said. “On my way.”

He terminated the call and stood, his legs unsteady. He had to move, had to play the part. He took two steps toward the door.

The world exploded in sound and light.

A deafening, pulsating alarm shattered the silence—a raw, electronic shriek that felt like needles driven into his temples. Crimson emergency lighting bathed the room in a bloody glow, stripping away all color, casting deep, monstrous shadows. The gentle hum of the facility vanished, replaced by the grinding thud of heavy security doors slamming shut, one after another, echoing through the corridors like the beating of a giant, metal heart.

“SECTOR LOCKDOWN INITIATED,” a synthesized voice boomed, devoid of all humanity. “UNAUTHORIZED DATA ACCESS DETECTED IN QUADRANT G-7. ALL PERSONNEL REMAIN IN YOUR CURRENT LOCATION. SECURITY DEPLOYMENT IMMINENT.”

G-7. His quadrant.

They hadn’t been monitoring his sleep cycle. They’d been monitoring the firewalls, waiting for him to bite. And he had taken the entire hook.

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s breath came in short, sharp gasps. The claustrophobia was no longer a mood; it was a physical reality. The walls were sealing him in. The air felt thin, recycled too many times. He could smell the sharp, electric tang of fear, his own.

He looked at the terminal. The screen was now flashing a single, relentless command: SECURE SESSION TERMINATED. AWAIT SECURITY.

He was trapped. The ghost was out, but the machine was closing around the man who’d set it free. Somewhere, in the labyrinth of corridors now sealed behind him, heavy boots would be pounding in unison, getting closer. Kaelen knew. Soren knew. And the Lazarus Strain, their terrible, conscience-born secret, was still here in the dark with him, waiting to be buried once and for all.
