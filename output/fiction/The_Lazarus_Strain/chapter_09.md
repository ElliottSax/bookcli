Chapter 9: The Thanatos Protocol

Chapter 9: The Thanatos Protocol

The silence after Renner left was a physical thing. It pressed against Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s eardrums, a vacuum filled only by the frantic thump of his own heart and the low, omnipresent hum of the Level 4 biocontainment systems. The airlock door to the server annex was still open, a rectangle of sterile white light beckoning from the main lab. Renner’s ultimatum hung in the air, more toxic than any pathogen: Perfect it, or become a subject yourself.
But Renner had made a mistake born of arrogance. He’d left Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne alone, assuming the threat and the locked doors were cage enough. He hadn’t accounted for the corrosive power of a betrayed conscience.
Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s fingers, slick with cold sweat, worked at the leather restraint on his left wrist. The buckle was stiff, designed to hold a thrashing subject. He twisted, the edge of the medical-grade polymer table digging into his forearm. A grunt of pain escaped him, sharp in the silence. He could hear, faintly, the chaos from the main lab—a distant alarm, a muffled shout. Leo was out. Elara Vance was with him. The calculus had changed.
With a final, wrenching twist, the strap came loose. He freed his other hand, then his ankles, rubbing at the raw, red marks they left behind. He stood, his legs trembling not from weakness, but from a surging, electric fury. He wasn’t a technician to be bullied. He was an archaeologist of death, and Renner had just shown him where the true tomb was.
He moved to the server annex door. It was unlocked. Renner’s oversight, or a trap? Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne didn’t care. The room was small, colder than the lab, a windowless cube lined with black server racks that buzzed like angry insects. The glow of LED status lights—red, green, amber—painted the room in a sickly, carnival glow. The central terminal was a sleek, monolithic touchscreen.
He sat. The system required a dual authentication: a keycard and a retinal scan. Renner’s, of course. But Elara Vance, in her final, whispered warnings before she turned, had given him a digital skeleton key—a zero-day exploit buried in the diagnostic protocols of the life-support monitors. “It’ll give you a ninety-second window in any subsystem,” she’d said, her voice thin with fear. “After that, it’ll trip a silent alarm. Don’t waste it.”

He plugged a slender, encrypted drive into a port and launched the exploit. The screen flickered, lines of code cascading. For a heart-stopping moment, nothing happened. Then, with a soft chime, the austere user interface dissolved, replaced by a root-level directory tree. The Prometheus Biotechnics research facility – Black Budget – Sigma Protocols.
He navigated, his breath fogging the cool screen. Financial ledgers, weapons procurement, geopolitical analysis. Dry, evil paperwork. Then he found it, nested in a folder cryptically labeled Harvest.
THANATOS PROTOCOL – EYES ONLY

He opened it. The document loaded, crisp and clinical. The header was the Prometheus Biotechnics research facility logo—the titan holding not fire, but a stylized double helix that morphed into a crumbling strand of DNA.
His eyes scanned the text. At first, it was the corporate doublespeak he expected: “Asset use,” “market conditioning,” “strategic deterrence.” Then the language sharpened, becoming a scalpel.
“The Lazarus Strain (LS-α) represents a binary model: controlled cellular regeneration (Project Phoenix) for Client Partners, and induced, rapid-onset cellular senescence (Project Thanatos) for population-level compliance.”

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s blood turned to ice. He read faster, the words blurring, then snapping into terrible focus.
“The airborne mutation (LS-β) is not a flaw. It is the delivery mechanism. Aerosolized, it remains inert in hosts pre-treated with the ‘Phoenix’ stabilizing primer. In unprimed hosts, LS-β binds to neural receptors associated with moral cognition and self-preservation, triggering a cascading cytokine storm and targeted apoptosis in the prefrontal cortex and major organ systems. Physical decay mirrors the psychological collapse: subjects experience an acute, conscious unraveling of their own biological integrity.”

It was a weapon. A weapon that didn’t just kill. It made you watch yourself die, cell by cell, while your very conscience turned against you. It was genocide with a philosophical twist.
He found the deployment schedules. Field tests in undisclosed “non-compliant regions.” Then the demonstration. A full-scale, unilateral “cleansing” of the dissident nation of Azakstan, slated for eleven days from now. The attached memos were cold-blooded market assessments. “A demonstration of Thanatos will solidify Client Partner commitment to the Phoenix subscription model. Annihilation and immortality are two sides of the same coin. One cannot exist without the market demand for the other.”

Renner wasn’t simply selling life. He was selling the fear of a very specific, extremely eloquent death. He was creating a world where the elite bought their permanence, and everyone else lived under the specter of being edited from existence for the crime of dissent.
Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s hands were shaking so badly he could barely control the touchscreen. He initiated a full data dump to his encrypted drive. A progress bar crawled across the screen. 10%. 20%. The server fans whirred louder, pumping heat into the claustrophobic room. The smell of ozone and hot metal filled his nostrils.
45%. He could hear footsteps outside, sharp and purposeful, approaching the lab. Not the running of chaos. The measured stride of control.
70%. The footsteps stopped at the main lab door. A keycard beeped. Access granted.
85%. The inner airlock hissed. Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne yanked the drive from the port, the action complete. He shoved it deep into the inner pocket of his lab coat, feeling its hard edge against his ribs.
He turned just as the server annex door slid open.
Reeves stood there, blocking the light. He wasn’t armed with a rifle this time merely st his formidable bulk and a cold, knowing expression. His eyes went from Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s face to the still-glowing terminal, the root-access menu stark on the screen.
“Dr. Aris Thorne,” Reeves said, his voice a low rumble. “The lockdown is for everyone. Even curious archaeologists.”

“It’s not curiosity,” Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne replied, standing, trying to keep his voice from cracking. “It’s homicide. On a scale you can’t possibly comprehend.”

Reeves took a step into the room. The space shrank around him. “I comprehend my orders. And my bonus. Renner said you might have a crisis of conscience. Told me to bring you back to the wet lab. One way or another.”

“He’s going to unleash a plague, Reeves. A smart plague that chooses who to kill based on whether they can pay his blood money.”

“Not my department,” Reev answered, taking another step. The server racks vibrated with his movement. “My department is you. Coming quietly, or not.”

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s eyes darted around the confined space. No weapons. No exits. Only the humming technology of doom. Then he saw it, on a small cart wedged between two servers: a sealed transport case, its biohazard logo glaring. A vial holder. And within, visible through the clear polymer, were two ampoules. One labeled LS-α (Stabilized). The other, LS-β (Aerosol Isolate – CONCENTRATE).
Reeves followed his gaze. A faint smirk touched his lips. “Don’t even think about it.”

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne thought about Leo. About the decay he’d seen in the time-lapse, the body turning against itself. He thought of Azakstan, a nation of seven million people, experiencing that en masse. A contagion of conscience.
He moved. Not toward the door, but toward the cart. Reeves was faster, a blur of efficient motion. A meaty hand clamped on Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s shoulder, spinning him around. The fist that followed was short, brutal, and aimed at his solar plexus. Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne twisted, taking the blow on his ribs instead. A lightning bolt of pain shot through him. He gasped, stumbling back into the server rack. LEDs swam in his vision.
Reeves closed in, methodical. “The hard way, then.”

Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne, fighting for breath, shoved the cart with all his remaining strength. It screeched across the polished floor, slamming into Reeves’s shins. The man grunted, stumbling. The transport case rocked, toppled, and hit the ground with a sound that was both plastic and profoundly fragile.
A hairline crack appeared in the clear polymer lid.
Both men froze, staring at the case. The crack was directly over the ampoule of LS-β concentrate. A wisp, almost invisible, like a heat haze, escaped from the seal. It hung in the chilled, artificially dry air of the server room.
Reeves’s smirk vanished, replaced by primal understanding. He took a hurried step back, his hand going to his face.
Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne held his breath, his lungs burning. The wisp dissipated, drawn into the room’s ventilation. For a three-count, nothing happened. Then the environmental system gave a soft click as it detected a particulate anomaly and switched to internal recirculation to prevent a breach.
It was recirculating the air in the room. The air they were both breathing.
Reeves’s eyes widened. “You idiot,” he hissed, but the bravado was gone, replaced by a glassy fear. He made for the door, his movements clumsy.
Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne didn’t wait. He ducked under Reeves’s swinging arm and burst out into the main lab. The scene was one of contained pandemonium. A containment unit stood shattered. Medical equipment was overturned. And there, by the shattered observation window, stood Leo.
He was free of his gown, dressed in scrubs that hung loose on his frame. His skin had a waxy, translucent quality, veins standing out in dark relief. But he stood straight. His eyes, when they found Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne, were not the eyes of a patient. They were ancient, full of a terrible, reassembled knowledge. Elara Vance was beside him, a hand on his arm, her face pale but resolute. She held a biometric keycard—Renner’s own, stolen.
“Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne!” she called.
He ran toward them, his ribs screaming. He risked a glance back. Reeves had emerged from the server room. He stood in the doorway, one hand braced against the frame. He was breathing heavily, deliberately. Assessing himself. Waiting for the tickle in his throat, the chill in his bones, the first whisper of his own biology turning traitor.
His eyes met Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne’s across the lab. There was no anger left. Only a horrified, dawning realization. He opened his mouth as if to speak, to curse, to plead. But no sound came out. Instead, he brought his other hand up to his chest, fingers splayed over his sternum.
Then, from the main airlock, a new voice, smooth and furious, cut through the din.
“Stop them.”

Silas Renner stood there, flanked by two other security men. He held a compact, wicked-looking pistol not at Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne, but at Leo. “The asset is paramount. Do not damage it. Kill the others.”

The guards raised their weapons. Reeves, still in the server room doorway, convulsed. A wet, ragged cough tore from his lungs. He looked down at his hand. A patch of skin on the back of it, where no injury had been, was graying, wrinkling, like paper held too close to a flame. He watched it happen, his face a mask of incomprehension. The decay was not fast, but it was inexorable, and he was utterly, consciously aware of it.
He screamed. Not a scream of pain, but of utter, philosophical horror. It was the sound of a man witnessing his own mortality not as a distant concept, but as a visible, accelerating process.
The sound distracted Renner for a fraction of a second.
“Now, Leo!” Elara Vance cried.
Leo moved. It wasn’t a run. It was a lope, unnervingly fluid, as if his joints understood a new physics. He grabbed a steel IV pole, wrenching it from its base, and swung it in a wide, whistling arc. It connected with the first guard’s rifle, sending it clattering across the floor. The second guard fired. The shot went wide, pinging off the titanium frame of a surgical robot.
Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne grabbed Elara Vance’s arm. “The service conduit! The one you showed me!”

She nodded, pulling him toward a panel near the floor, partially hidden behind a crashed drone cart. She swiped Renner’s keycard. The panel hissed open, revealing a dark, narrow space barely larger than a ventilation shaft, smelling of stale air and wiring.
“Go!” she urged.
Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne looked back. Leo was a whirlwind of desperate, preternatural strength, holding the two guards at bay with the pole, his body a shield. Renner was aiming again, his composure shattered into icy rage.
“Leo, come on!” Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne yelled.
Leo glanced at them, at the open conduit. In that moment, a guard lunged, tackling him around the waist. They crashed to the floor in a tangle of limbs.
“We can’t leave him!” Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne said.
“We have to!” Elara Vance’s eyes were streaming tears of fury and grief. “He’s buying us the time! He wants this! He understands the protocol!”

She shoved Dr. Dr. Aris Thorne into the conduit. He scrambled forward on hands and knees into the absolute blackness. Elara Vance followed, pulling the panel shut behind them with a final, echoing clang.
The last sound from the lab was not a gunshot. It was Silas Renner’s voice, cold and clear, giving an order that followed them into the dark:

“Seal the level. Initiate sterilization purge. And bring me Subject Alpha. Alive. His blood is now the only viable blueprint we have left.”

And beneath that, fading as they crawled blindly into the bowels of the facility, another sound: the soft, relentless, and utterly conscious sound of Agent Reeves weeping as he watched his own hand die.
