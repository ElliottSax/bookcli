      "role": "Protagonist, disgraced virologist",
      "description": "Late 30s to early 40s. Once a brilliant and celebrated scientist, now a hollowed-out man living in self-imposed exile in Berlin. Haunted, perceptive, and burdened by catastrophic ethical failure.",
      "arc": "From a state of paralyzed guilt and self-loathing, through a reluctant investigation into his own past, to a final, chilling realization that his greatest sin\u2014the knowledge of resurrection\u2014has escaped into the world.

      "name": "Lena",
      "role": "Ghost / Motivator",
      "description": "Aris's former partner, both professionally and personally. Remembered for her intelligent eyes and vibrant laugh. She represents the life, optimism, and ethical clarity Aris has lost.",

      "name": "Elara Vance",
      "role": "Investigator / Catalyst",
      "description": "A sharp, determined investigator for a European biotech oversight committee. Pragmatic, thorough, and initially skeptical of Aris. She is the bridge between Aris's isolated world and the active conspiracy.",

  "narrative_voice": "Close third-person, primarily focused through Aris Thorne's perspective. The prose is clinical yet visceral, blending scientific precision with raw sensory detail and psychological depth. Flashbacks are fragmented and sensory, mirroring traumatic memory.",
  "tone": "Paranoid, melancholic, intellectually rigorous, and suspenseful. The tone is one of pervasive dread and cold unease, punctuated by moments of stark revelation. It's a thriller of ideas as much as action, where the greatest terror is understanding.",
  "plot_summary": "Disgraced virologist Dr. Aris Thorne lives in self-imposed exile in Berlin, haunted by the memory of 'The Fall'\u2014a catastrophic ethical breach involving 'The Lazarus Strain,' a resurrection technology he helped pioneer at Prometheus Biotechnics. Dragged from his isolation by investigator Elara Vance, he is forced to relive his past during official hearings. Just as he believes the nightmare is being buried by bureaucracy, a silent, unidentified man delivers a blank card to him. The card reveals only a watermark: a double-helix ouroboros. Aris understands that Prometheus was not the end. The knowledge he unleashed has survived, acquired by a new, even more secretive entity. The story ends not with closure, but with the chilling realization that the genie is irrevocably out of the bottle, and a new, more shadowy race has begun."
