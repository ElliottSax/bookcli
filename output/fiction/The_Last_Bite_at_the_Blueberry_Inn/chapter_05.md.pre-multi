Chapter 5: A Taste of Corruption

Chapter 5: A Taste of Corruption

The scent of woodsmoke and caramelized sugar hung over Maple Creek like a cheap perfume. It was a smell the town marketed relentlessly, printed on postcards and woven into the welcome speech at the annual Fall Festival. To Elara, standing at the edge of the mayor’s so-called “artisanal syrup works,” it smelled like a lie. Underneath the robust, almost cloying sweetness was a thin, chemical sharpness, like burnt plastic and regret.

She adjusted the collar of her borrowed blazer, a sleek, charcoal grey number from Margot’s assistant, Leo. “Look corporate,” he’d urged, his hands still shaking from their clandestine meeting in the hushed stacks of the county library. “Look like you have money to spend. He’s a salesman first, a crook second.” The memoir’s clues had led here, to a sprawling, sanitized complex on the outskirts of town, far from the quaint sugar shacks tourists visited. According to Margot’s notes, the real syrup flow in Willow Creek wasn’t from maple trees, but from a pipeline of corruption, and its tap was Mayor Donovan Finch.

Donovan met her at the entrance, his smile a masterpiece of municipal charm. “Ms. Vance! A pleasure. We don’t often get culinary investors from the city taking an interest in our little operation.” He was a big man, not with fat, but with a solid, imposing presence, like a well-polished oak tree. His handshake was firm, calibrated to inspire trust.

“The pleasure’s mine, Mayor,” Elara said, her voice cool and professional. “The ‘farm-to-fork’ movement is evolving. We’re looking for authentic, traceable luxury ingredients. Your literature was very persuasive.”

His laugh was a warm barrel roll. “Well, we pride ourselves on authenticity. This is the heart of Vermont, after all. Right this way.”

The tour was a performance. Shiny stainless-steel vats gleamed under fluorescent lights. Workers in hairnets and pristine coats moved with choreographed efficiency. Donovan spoke of terroir, of the unique mineral content of the local soil, of slow, wood-fired evaporation. He showed her the “small-batch” room, where copper kettles steamed picturesquely. Elara nodded, asked about yield and boiling temperatures, and let her senses stretch.

It was in the main bottling hall that the lie began to curdle. The air here was different—hotter, thicker, with a humid, syrupy weight that coated the back of the throat. And the smell… the robust maple was there, but it was shouting to cover up a whisper. A whisper of corn syrup, of hydrolyzed starch, of the industrial sweetener base she’d tasted a thousand times in cheap, mass-produced desserts. It was the olfactory equivalent of a poorly tuned orchestra.

“This is where the magic happens,” Donovan boomed, gesturing to a roaring filling line where bottles clinked along a conveyor. “Grade A, Dark Robust. Our flagship.”

“May I?” Elara asked, stepping closer to a sampling station before he could answer. A technician, looking nervously at the mayor, handed her a small plastic cup of the warm, amber liquid.

Donovan watched, his genial smile fixed. Elara lifted the cup. The color was perfect, a deep, inviting amber. She swirled it. The “legs” ran down the side too quickly, lacking the viscous, velvety cling of true maple. She brought it to her nose. The top note was all maple, an aggressive, almost single-note blast. But beneath it, hiding in the steam, was that hollow, sugary flatness.

Then she tasted it.

It flooded her mouth with a sweetness that was immediate and overwhelming, a frontal assault that lacked journey. True maple syrup had complexity—a caramel start, a woody middle, a subtle, almost smoky finish that lingered like a good story. This was a one-word shout: Sweet! And then, just as she swallowed, a ghost of a aftertaste, a faint, metallic tang that vanished almost before it registered, like a secret being swallowed.

She kept her face a placid mask of consideration, setting the cup down. “A very… assertive flavor profile, Mayor Finch.”

“Our trees have character,” he said, but his eyes had narrowed slightly, studying her. The tour moved on, but the atmosphere had shifted. The charm on his part became more pointed, the questions more probing. He asked about her “investment group,” their portfolio. Elara, drawing on a decade of restaurant finance meetings, parried with vague, credible answers about sustainable luxury markets.

The finale of the tour was the “archive,” a temperature-controlled room lined with shelves holding bottles from every harvest year. It was here, amid the staged history, that Elara saw it. A pallet, partially obscured by a hanging Vermont flag, stacked not with the elegant glass bottles for retail, but with large, industrial plastic drums. A faded logo was stamped on their sides: GLYCO-SWEET INDUSTRIES – HFCS BASE 90.

Donovan followed her gaze. The affable mayor vanished. The man who turned to her was colder, his presence seeming to fill the small room, pushing out the air. The woodsmoke-and-leather scent of him turned sharp.

“A sideline,” he said, his voice losing its folksy cadence. “We supply base product to some larger food manufacturers. Not as glamorous, but a town has bills to pay.”

“Of course,” Elara said, her heart hammering against her ribs. She turned to face him fully, dropping the pretense. “It must be expensive, maintaining two separate operations. The real, small-batch maple for show, and the high-fructose corn syrup you blend and bottle as Grade A. The margins must be incredible.”

The silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the hum of the climate control. Donovan didn’t bluster or deny. He simply looked at her, reassessing. The charm was gone, replaced by a weary, calculating ruthlessness.

“You have a very discerning palate, Ms. Vance. Or should I say, Chef Arden?” He let the name hang. “I did some digging after you called. The fallen star of Le Jardin. Quite a tragedy. And now you’re here, poking around my syrup works. Margot sent you, didn’t she? Even from the grave, that woman is a nuisance.”

“She was a truth-teller,” Elara said, holding her ground.

“She was a gossip with a typewriter,” he corrected softly. He took a step closer. He didn’t need to shout; the quiet menace was more potent. “You know, running an historic inn is a delicate business. So many regulations. Health codes, fire safety, zoning variances for that charming patio of yours. A single, serious violation… well, it could shutter a place for months. Or for good. The county inspector is a very thorough man. And a good friend.”

The threat was as clear and sticky as the fake syrup. It wasn’t a violent promise, but a bureaucratic one. He would bury her, not in the woods, but in paperwork and red tape. He would take the Blueberry Inn, her fresh start, her sanctuary, and crush it slowly, legally.

“I’m just a chef, Mayor,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “Trying to run my business.”

“Then run it,” he said, the smile returning, but it never reached his eyes. They were the flat, grey color of a winter lake. “Focus on your scones, Elara. Let the town handle its own… recipes. Some secrets are best kept, like a family preserve. They keep the community sweet.”

He led her out, the genial host once more, waving her off from the main doors. “Do give my best to young Leo,” he added casually, as she reached her car. The final, chilling twist of the knife. He knew about Leo, too.

Elara drove back to the inn on autopilot, the taste of corruption still coating her tongue. She scrubbed her mouth with water, but the cloying, false sweetness seemed embedded. She needed to talk to someone with authority, someone outside Finch’s orbit. The only candidate was Sheriff Lowell.

She found him at the station, looking more rumpled than usual, a half-eaten ham sandwich on his desk. She laid it out, careful, omitting Leo’s direct involvement, speaking of “discrepancies” she’d noticed, the industrial drums, the chemical aftertaste.

Lowell listened, chewing slowly. He didn’t seem surprised. When she finished, he sighed, a deep, weary sound. “Elara, Mayor Finch’s operation is the largest employer in the county after the ski resort. It brings in a lot of revenue. A lot.”

“It’s fraud,” she insisted. “On a massive scale.”

“And your proof is… your tongue?” he asked, not unkindly, but with a frustrating pragmatism. “He’s got certificates, inspections, paperwork a mile long. What you saw is a legal blending operation. He’s got permits for that, too.”

“The bottles say ‘100% Pure Maple Syrup’!”

“And I’m sure he has a separate, pure line. You saw the copper kettles.” He leaned forward. “Look, even if there’s something there—and I’m not saying there is—it’s a matter for the state’s attorney, the FDA. Not my department. My job is keeping the peace in Willow Creek.”

“Your job is upholding the law,” she shot back, frustration boiling over.

A shadow passed over his face. For a moment, he looked older, defeated. “My brother, Cal,” he said, his voice dropping. “He got hurt bad at the mill before it closed. Medical bills… Finch gave him a job as the security manager out at the syrup works. Good salary, full benefits. My nephew’s at Dartmouth because of that job.” He met her eyes, and there was a plea in them. A plea for her to understand the tangled, human web of it all. “You start shaking that tree, Elara, a lot of good people are gonna fall out. Not just him.”

The revelation landed like a stone in her gut. The sheriff wasn’t just complacent; he was compromised. Financially, emotionally tied to the very operation he should be investigating. The corruption wasn’t just in the syrup; it was in the foundations of the town itself.

Dejected, she returned to the inn. The evening service was a blur of poached eggs and hollandaise, of smiling at guests while her mind churned in the dark, syrupy depths of Finch’s threat and Lowell’s complicity. She closed up early, the weight of the day pressing down on her.

Sleep wouldn’t come. The air felt thick, charged. Sometime after midnight, she heard the first sirens. Distant, then multiplying, a chorus of alarm cutting through the mountain quiet. She went to her window. To the north, toward the industrial park, the sky was not black, but a pulsating, angry orange. Thick, oily smoke, darker than the night, billowed into the air, blotting out the stars.

The syrup works were on fire.

By the time she drove over, the scene was chaos. Fire trucks from three towns ringed the complex, their lights painting the swirling smoke in frantic reds and blues. The heat was immense, a physical wall that pushed against the crowd of onlookers. The main building was intact, but a smaller, single-story annex was fully engulfed, flames licking hungrily from its windows and roof.

“Records office,” a soot-faced firefighter muttered to his chief as Elara edged closer, staying in the shadows. “Gonna be a total loss.”

Mayor Finch stood with Sheriff Lowell, their faces grim and flickering in the hellish light. Finch was on his phone, barking orders about containment and press statements. Lowell was directing deputies to keep the crowd back. Their body language was tense, but coordinated. This was a crisis to be managed.

As the fire crews began to gain the upper hand, dousing the blaze into a hissing, steaming ruin, Elara’s instincts took over. This was too convenient. The one building holding the paper trail—the invoices from Glyco-Sweet, the blending logs, the shipping manifests Margot must have hinted at in her memoir—was now a blackened shell.

Under cover of the lingering smoke and the distracted emergency crews, she slipped around the back of the annex. The air was acrid, filled with the stench of burnt plastic, melted sugar, and wet ash. The outer wall was hot to the touch. A deputy’s uniform, left on a nearby fence post, provided cover; she grabbed the high-visibility vest and slipped it on, pulling the collar up.

The rear door to the records office was hanging off its hinges, a dark maw exhaling heat and the smell of destruction. Using the light from her phone, she stepped inside.

The devastation was absolute. Desks were charcoal skeletons. Filing cabinets had burst open, their contents now just drifts of grey ash. The ceiling had partially collapsed. Everything was soaked, dripping, and hot. Her heart sank. Any proof was gone, vaporized.

She was about to leave when her light caught a glint on the sodden floor near the blasted-out frame of what was once a private office door. Not a glint of metal, but something else. She knelt, careful of the hot debris.

It was a button, half-melted into a puddle of congealed plastic from a computer monitor. It was circular, about the size of a quarter. Its surface was badly warped by heat, but the design was still unmistakable: a seven-pointed star within a raised circle, the words “Willow Creek Sheriff’s Dept.” etched around the edge, though now blurred and twisted. It was a deputy’s uniform button.

But no deputy had been in here fighting the fire. They were all outside, on crowd control. This button was old, its back shank almost melted away. It had been here before the fire.

A cold certainty washed over her, cutting through the residual heat. This fire wasn’t an accident. It was arson. A cleanup. And someone with access to a sheriff’s deputy uniform—past or present—had been in this office to set it.

As she stared at the melted star in her soot-stained palm, the voices from outside grew louder. The crowd was being dispersed. She heard Sheriff Lowell’s voice, closer now, barking an order.

She pocketed the button, the metal still warm against her thigh, and faded back into the shadows of the night, the taste of smoke and secrets sharp in her mouth. The hook was set, and it had just drawn blood.
