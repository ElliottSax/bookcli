Chapter 8: A Palate for Poison

Chapter 8: A Palate for Poison

The storm that had threatened all week finally broke over Blueberry Harbor. It wasn’t a violent tempest, but a persistent, whispering rain that turned the cobblestones to dark mirrors and filled the gutters with the sound of a hidden stream. Inside the Blueberry Inn, the world was reduced to a warm, golden sphere of lamplight and the scent of rising dough. Elara stood at the central island, her hands buried in a mound of rye flour and sourdough starter, but her mind was miles away, lost in the cold, precise language of toxicology reports.

Leo, the bartender, was a red herring. A frightened, guilty-feeling red herring, but a distraction all the same. He’d fled not because he’d administered the poison, but because he’d supplied the glass, wiped it clean, and known—or suspected—who might have had access to it afterward. His connection to the old kitchen fire was a tragedy, a scar, but not the weapon. The weapon was science.

After Leo panicked and left, Elara had called in a favor from a former colleague, now a forensic chemist in Boston. She described the symptoms, the rapid onset, the cherry-red blood lividity mentioned in the coroner’s initial, overly brief report. She pressed him, and he murmured possibilities over the crackling line. When she suggested a specific cyanide compound—potassium ferrocyanide, used in old-school photography and, in a cruel twist, sometimes as an anti-caking agent in salt—he went quiet.

“Rare,” he said. “Not your standard issue. Tasteless, works fast with moisture and acid. Like, say, in a cocktail. If it was that, your killer knew what they were doing. Or got very lucky.”

The memory of the mayor’s smug, composed face floated before her. He hadn’t seemed lucky. He’d seemed informed.

The dough beneath her fingers was alive, a resilient, breathing thing. She kneaded with a rhythmic intensity, the heels of her palms pushing, folding, turning. Baking was alchemy, but it was honest alchemy. You couldn’t hide a bitter almond note in a perfect baguette; the flour and yeast would rebel. Poison was a different kind of recipe, one that relied on concealment, on the betrayal of trust. Someone had baked a lie into the very fabric of the town’s comfort.

The rain eased to a drizzle as dawn bleached the sky the color of old porcelain. Elara, unable to sleep, had finished the rye loaves and started on a batch of lemon-poppy seed muffins, the bright zest a defiant counterpoint to her dark thoughts. She needed to follow the chemical. It was a tangible thread in a tapestry of whispers.

Her first stop was the Blueberry Bay Pharmacy, but old Mr. Henderson, after adjusting his spectacles and consulting dusty ledgers, shook his head. “Haven’t stocked cyanide compounds since the seventies, my dear. Too much liability. Even for photography.”

Photography.

The word hung in the air, mingling with the scent of talcum powder and wintergreen. Blueberry Harbor had one full-time photographer.
