The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, bleaching the scuffed linoleum to a sickly yellow. Elara Vance didn’t blink. “Why?” she repeated, the word cutting the chemical-scented air. “Why did someone die for this?”

Donovan’s jaw worked, a muscle twitching beneath his skin. The stale coffee stink from a forgotten mug couldn’t mask the sharper tang of his sweat. He was holding his breath. Elara held his stare, her own pulse a steady drum against her ribs. This silence wasn’t empty; it was a held thing, straining at its seams.

His eyes, dark and assessing, swept over her—measuring her resolve, pricing her threat. She straightened her spine, bracing for the dismissal, the lie. But beneath the calculation, something else flickered. Not warmth, but a keen, predatory interest. The room’s dimensions shifted, the walls pressing closer. She had to move now, before the opening sealed shut.

“Tell me,” she said, leaning forward, her palms flat on the cold table. “What do you know about the murder?”

A flash of raw anger contorted his features, so brief she might have imagined it. Then it was gone, smoothed into a veneer of polite concern. “A tragic event,” he said, his voice a low, careful monotone. “The police are pursuing every lead.”

It was the official line, polished and hollow. Her nails dug into her own palms. “I don’t believe you. You know more. And you’re going to tell me.”

His gaze hardened, locking onto hers with a force that pushed the air from her lungs. She didn’t look away. One more second, one more push—

The door crashed open.

A woman in a severe black suit filled the doorway, her focus laser-sharp on Donovan. “I need you. Now.”

Irritation tightened the skin around his eyes before he mastered it, rising with a diplomat’s calm. “Of course. Excuse me, Ms. Vance.”

He followed the woman out without a backward glance. The door sighed shut, leaving Elara alone with the hum of the lights.

Frustration burned a hot path up her throat. She’d almost had him. Almost. The silence now was different—accusing and complete. She pushed back from the table, the chair legs screeching against the floor. No. She wasn’t starting over. She was just changing tactics.

The hallway outside stretched, a tunnel of identical doors under the same relentless glare. Her footsteps echoed, a solitary beat against the vinyl. At the end, the exit door was a solid slab of steel, but she pushed through it without hesitation.

The outside air hit her, cold and laced with distant exhaust. The town of Millhaven lay before her, a puzzle box of rain-slicked streets and watchful windows. Her name was dirt here, a smear in the mud. She could feel the weight of that judgment in the glance of a woman crossing the street, in the quick duck of a shopkeeper’s head.

She started walking. Past the shuttered pharmacy, the diner with its neon sign sputtering. The scrutiny was a physical pressure, but she kept her chin up, her stride even. In the grimy window of the hardware store, her own reflection stared back—a woman alone, but not defeated. There, in her own eyes, was the spark. Not hope, but a cold, clean certainty.

She would pull this town apart brick by brick if she had to. She would find the truth buried beneath its polite smiles and closed doors. The murder had happened here. The answers were here.

And she would dig them out.
