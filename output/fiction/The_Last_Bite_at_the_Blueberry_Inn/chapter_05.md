The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the worn linoleum floor, making the space feel like a sterile, clinical environment. Elara's eyes locked onto Donovan's, her gaze steady as she pressed her advantage. The air between them vibrated with tension, the silence between them a palpable thing that seemed to thicken with every passing moment.

"Why?" Elara asked again, her voice firm but controlled. "Why did someone die for this?"

Donovan's jaw tightened, his eyes narrowing as he struggled to maintain his composure. The faint scent of stale coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the faint tang of disinfectant. Elara's mind was a whirlwind of questions, her thoughts racing with the implications of what she was hearing.

Elara met his gaze, her pulse steady, proof of her growing unease. She could feel the weight of the situation bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown. Donovan's eyes seemed to bore into her very soul, as if searching for any sign of weakness, any crack in her resolve.

The silence stretched out, a thin, brittle thread that seemed to vibrate with tension. Elara's eyes never left Donovan's face, her gaze a steady, unyielding force that seemed to push him back, to force him to confront the truth.

Finally, Donovan spoke, his voice low and measured. "Margot was a good woman," he said, the words dripping with a sincerity that Elara couldn't quite believe. "But she was also reckless. She saw things she shouldn't have, asked questions she shouldn't have asked. I tried to warn her."

Elara's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with the implications of what she was hearing. She could feel the weight of the truth bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown. Donovan's words seemed to dance around the edges of the truth, leaving her with more questions than answers.

"Warn her?" Elara's voice was sharp, a challenge to Donovan's words. "Or threaten her?"

Donovan's eyes hardened, his jaw tightening as he struggled to maintain his composure. "I'm a public servant, Ms. Vance," he said, his voice dripping with a sincerity that Elara couldn't quite believe. "I don't threaten people. But I do protect this town. And sometimes, that means making hard choices."

The words hung in the air, a challenge to Elara's perceptions, a reminder that the truth was often a complex, multifaceted thing. She could feel the weight of the situation bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown. Donovan's words seemed to dance around the edges of the truth, leaving her with more questions than answers.

Elara's mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, her thoughts racing with the implications of what she was hearing. She could feel the weight of the truth bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown. Donovan's words seemed to dance around the edges of the truth, leaving her with more questions than answers.

"What kind of choices?" Elara asked, her voice firm but controlled. "The kind that keep the lights on. The kind that put food on the table. You think this town can survive on tourism alone? The real money comes from the syrup. And the syrup comes from the trees. And the trees come from the land. And the land..."

Elara's words trailed off, her mind racing with the implications of what she was hearing. The room seemed to grow smaller, the air thickening with tension as she struggled to make sense of Donovan's words. She could feel the weight of the truth bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown.

Donovan's eyes snapped back to hers, his gaze piercing as he struggled to maintain his composure. "The land comes with a price," he said, his voice low and measured. "Sometimes, you have to do what's necessary to keep things running. To keep people employed. To keep the town alive."

Elara's stomach twisted, her mind racing with the implications of what she was hearing. She could feel the weight of the truth bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown. Donovan's words seemed to dance around the edges of the truth, leaving her with more questions than answers.

"At what cost?" Elara asked, her voice firm but controlled. "At the cost of the truth, Ms. Vance. And sometimes, the truth is a luxury we can't afford."

The words hung in the air, a challenge to Elara's perceptions, a reminder that the truth was often a complex, multifaceted thing. She could feel the weight of the situation bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown. Donovan's words seemed to dance around the edges of the truth, leaving her with more questions than answers.

Elara's heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing with the implications of what she was hearing. She knew she was walking a dangerous line, but she couldn't back down now. "Margot paid that price, didn't she?" she asked, her voice firm but controlled.

Donovan's expression darkened, his eyes narrowing as he struggled to maintain his composure. "Margot made her own choices," he said, his voice dripping with a sincerity that Elara couldn't quite believe. "And she paid the consequences."

Elara's mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, her thoughts racing with the implications of what she was hearing. She could feel the weight of the truth bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown. Donovan's words seemed to dance around the edges of the truth, leaving her with more questions than answers.

"What was she involved in?" Elara asked, her voice firm but controlled.

Donovan's eyes narrowed, his jaw tightening as he struggled to maintain his composure. "You're playing a dangerous game, Ms. Vance," he said, his voice dripping with a sincerity that Elara couldn't quite believe. "You should leave while you still can."

Elara's resolve hardened, her mind racing with the implications of what she was hearing. She knew she was walking a dangerous line, but she couldn't back down now. "I'm not leaving until I find out what happened to Margot," she said, her voice firm but controlled.

Donovan's smile was cold, his eyes narrowing as he struggled to maintain his composure. "Then you're a fool," he said, his voice dripping with a sincerity that Elara couldn't quite believe. "And fools don't last long in this town."

Elara's heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing with the implications of what she was hearing. She knew she was walking a dangerous line, but she couldn't back down now. "I'm not afraid of you, Mayor Finch," she said, her voice firm but controlled.

Donovan's eyes narrowed, his jaw tightening as he struggled to maintain his composure. "You should be," he said, his voice dripping with a sincerity that Elara couldn't quite believe.

The silence stretched out, a thin, brittle thread that seemed to vibrate with tension. Elara's eyes never left Donovan's face, her gaze a steady, unyielding force that seemed to push him back, to force him to confront the truth. She could feel the weight of the situation bearing down on her, the crushing pressure of the unknown.

As the silence stretched out, Elara's thoughts turned to Margot, to the questions she had yet to answer. She knew she was walking a dangerous line, but she couldn't back down now. She had to find out the truth, no matter the cost.

The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy, casting an unforgiving glare on the worn linoleum floor. Elara's eyes locked onto Donovan's, her gaze steady as she pressed her advantage. The air between them vibrated with tension, the silence between them a palpable thing that seemed to thicken with every passing moment.

And then, without warning, the door to the room burst open, the sound of footsteps echoing through the hallway. Elara's eyes never left Donovan's face, her gaze a steady, unyielding force that seemed to push him back, to force him to confront the truth.

A figure stood in the doorway, a tall, imposing man with a stern expression. "Mayor Finch," he said, his voice firm but controlled. "I think it's time we had a word."

Donovan's eyes narrowed, his jaw tightening as he struggled to maintain his composure. "What is it, Jenkins?" he asked, his voice dripping with a sincerity that Elara couldn't quite believe.

The man's eyes flicked to Elara, his gaze lingering on her face before returning to Donovan's. "I think we have a problem, Mayor," he said, his voice firm but controlled. "A problem that requires your attention."

Donovan's expression darkened, his eyes narrowing as he struggled to maintain his composure. "What kind of problem?" he asked, his voice dripping with a sincerity that Elara couldn't quite believe.

The man's eyes flicked to Elara, his gaze lingering on her face before returning to Donovan's. "A problem that involves Ms. Vance," he said, his voice firm but controlled. "A problem that requires your immediate attention."

Elara's heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing with the implications of what she was hearing. She knew she was walking a dangerous line, but she couldn't back down now. She had to find out the truth, no matter the cost.

As the man stepped forward, his eyes locked onto Donovan's, Elara's thoughts turned to Margot, to the questions she had yet to answer. She knew she was walking a dangerous line, but she couldn't back down now. She had to find out the truth, no matter the cost.

The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy, casting an unforgiving glare on the worn linoleum floor. Elara's eyes locked onto Donovan's, her gaze steady as she pressed her advantage. The air between them vibrated with tension, the silence between them a palpable thing that seemed to thicken with every passing moment.

And then, without warning, the room seemed to erupt into chaos, the sound of footsteps echoing through the hallway as the man stepped forward, his eyes locked onto Donovan's. Elara's eyes never left Donovan's face, her gaze a steady, unyielding force that seemed to push him back, to force him to confront the truth.
