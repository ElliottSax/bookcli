Chapter 2: A Recipe for Framing

The scent of rain on old brick and damp earth seeped through the kitchen’s screen door, a clean smell that did nothing to cut the lingering ghosts of last night’s feast: the memory of seared duck fat, the faint, floral whisper of lavender, the tang of blueberry gastrique. To Elara, the kitchen was no longer a sanctuary of measured cups and simmering pots. It was a crime scene, silent and accusing.

Two uniformed officers stood like sentinels at the entrance, their presence turning her familiar haven into a foreign land. The chrome of the industrial fridge was smudged with fingerprint powder. Every container, every knife block, every sprig of thyme in the window herb garden felt like evidence against her. Chief Henderson, a broad man with a perpetual squint and a mustache that seemed to bristle with skepticism, had delivered the news with a grim finality an hour ago.

“Procedure, Elara. Your kitchen, your food. It’s the last thing we know she ate. We have to seal it.”

He hadn’t called her “Ms. Vance.” Not “Elara, honey,” as he did when he came in for his weekly slice of mile-high lemon meringue pie. It was a cold, procedural “you.” The door had been sealed with bright yellow tape that screamed POLICE LINE – DO NOT CROSS. It cut across her vision every time she walked through the inn’s hallway, a garish gash across the heart of her home.

Now, she sat in the formal parlor, a room reserved for checking in and afternoon tea. The overstuffed chintz armchair, usually so comforting, felt like a dock. Chief Henderson occupied the matching sofa, a notebook balanced on his knee. Detective Carson, a lean, sharp-eyed woman new to Sparrow’s Crest, leaned against the mantelpiece, observing. The fire was unlit. The room was chill.

“Walk me through it again, from the plating,” Henderson said, his voice a low rumble.

Elara took a steadying breath, the floral pattern of the chair blurring under her fixed gaze. “The duck rested for precisely twelve minutes. I plated it on the warmed Wedgwood. The confit leg garnish, the gastrique spooned in a crescent, the lavender salt sprinkled last. I carried it out myself. Margot took her seat. She… she always inspected a dish visually first. She cut into the breast. The skin was crisp. She ate three bites.”

“And her reaction?”

“She said…” Elara closed her eyes, the memory vivid, acidic. “‘The lavender is a whisper, not a shout. Competent.’” She opened her eyes. “That was high praise, from her.”

“And after? The blueberry pie? The port?”

“She declined the port. She had a single cup of black coffee. She finished approximately seventy percent of the duck and all of the roasted baby vegetables. She then retired to her suite, the Lilac Room, at approximately nine-fifteen p.m. I cleared the table myself. The remaining food went into the compost bin out back. The dishes were washed.”

Detective Carson spoke for the first time, her voice cool and smooth as river stone. “You were alone in the kitchen all evening. No one else handled that plate.”

It wasn’t a question. “No. I run a small inn. I’m the chef, the owner, the sommelier. It’s just me and Becca, who handles housekeeping and front desk until seven.”

“And you had a… history with the deceased,” Carson continued, glancing at her notes. “A public disagreement last year at the Berkshire Food Festival. She called your methodology ‘forensic fussiness’ in her column.”

A hot needle of shame and anger pricked Elara’s throat. “It was a professional disagreement. She believed instinct trumped science in the kitchen. I disagreed. It wasn’t personal.” Even as she said it, she knew how flimsy it sounded. In the world of food, criticism from Margot Finch was personal. It was career-altering.

“We’ll need a list of everyone who’s been in the inn this week,” Henderson said, closing his notebook with a soft snap that echoed in the quiet room. “And Elara… don’t leave town. This is just preliminary, but until we get the tox screen back…”

“You’ve sealed my kitchen. My only source of income. Where would I go?” The words came out brittle, like overcooked sugar.

After they left, the silence of the inn pressed in on her, thick and suffocating. The grandfather clock in the hall ticked with a ponderous, accusing rhythm. Your fault. Your fault. Your fault. She walked to the sealed kitchen door, peering through the glass pane at her kingdom in exile. Her gaze fell on the compost pail, still sitting by the back door, waiting to be emptied. They’d taken samples, but the bulk remained. A forensics team from the county had been thorough, but they were looking for poison in the food. They weren’t thinking like a forensic chef. They weren’t thinking about what wasn’t there.

She needed that autopsy report.

The Sparrow’s Crest Medical Center was a modest brick building that smelled of antiseptic and industrial lemon cleaner. Elara’s contact was not a former colleague, but a grateful recipient of her culinary skills. Old Joe Henderson—no relation to the Chief—was the county coroner, a man whose passion for pulled pork was eclipsed only by his love for gossip. Last fall, Elara had spent a weekend perfecting a Carolina-style barbecue sauce just for him, after he’d lamented the lack of decent ‘cue in the county. He’d declared it a “damn miracle.”

She found him in his cluttered office, a styrofoam container of dubious cafeteria food pushed to one side. His eyes, magnified by thick glasses, widened when he saw her.

“Elara. Hell of a thing.” He shook his head, jowls wobbling. “Awful. Just awful.”

“It is, Joe. I’m… I’m in a bind. Henderson has my kitchen sealed.” She placed a sturdy paper bag on his desk. The scent of warm yeast and cinnamon curled into the air. “Fresh sticky buns. Your favorite. The glaze is made with a touch of orange blossom honey.”

Joe eyed the bag, then her face, his expression warring between sympathy and professional caution. “You know I can’t share official documents, Elara. It’s more than my job’s worth.”

“I’m not asking for the file. I’m asking for you, as a professional, to tell me what could have happened. Hypothetically. If, say, someone of Margot Finch’s stature died from cyanide ingestion.” She let the words hang, watching him. His loyalty was to truth, but also to the intricate web of small-town favors. And to perfect sticky buns.

He sighed, a long, wheezing sound. He pulled the bag towards him, peeking inside. The rich, sweet smell intensified. “Hypothetically,” he began, slowly, “cyanide is fast. Dramatic. If it was in her dinner, she’d likely have shown symptoms at the table. Violent ones. You’d have noticed.”

Elara’s heart began to pound, a steady, hopeful drum. “But if it wasn’t in the dinner?”

Joe leaned back, his chair groaning. “Hypothetically, the stomach contents and digestion rate put time of ingestion roughly between ten p.m. and midnight. A good hour or more after she left your dining room.”

The world sharpened. The grime on the window, the hum of the fluorescent light, the faint tang of formaldehyde under the lemon—all snapped into hyperfocus. Ten and midnight. The duck was innocent. Her food was clean.

“Was there anything else? In her room?” Elara asked, her voice barely a whisper.

Joe hesitated, then opened a drawer, pulling out a copy of the evidence log. He didn’t hand it to her, but laid it flat on the desk, his finger tracing down the list. “Usual stuff. Handbag, toiletries, a novel, empty water glass on the nightstand…” His finger stopped. “One wine glass, residue sent for analysis.”

One wine glass. Margot had declined port. Elara had cleared the table herself. There had been no wine glass in the Lilac Room when she’d turned down the bed earlier that evening. She’d placed a carafe of water and a single, clean tumbler on the nightstand.

“Thank you, Joe,” she said, her mind already racing down the hallways of the inn, into the
