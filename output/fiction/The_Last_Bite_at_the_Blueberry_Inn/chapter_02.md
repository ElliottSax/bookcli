The familiar scent of rain on sun-baked brick and damp earth drifted through the kitchen’s screen door, but this morning it lost its freshness beneath the stale, clinging odors of last night’s feast. The air hung thick with the greasy perfume of seared duck fat—once a mark of perfection, now a reminder of excess and decay. A ghost of lavender and the sharp tang of blueberry gastrique cut through the heaviness, a cruel parody of the kitchen’s usual warmth. Morning light, usually a gentle blessing, fell harsh and unforgiving across the stainless steel, exposing every smudge and watermark.

Two police officers stood at the entrance to the hall, their dark uniforms a jarring slash against the warm wood. The smell of wet pavement, stale coffee, and gun oil invaded the space. Chrome surfaces bore the gray smudges of fingerprint powder; every canister and knife block stared back at her, silent witnesses. Chief Henderson’s voice was flat. “Procedure, Ms. Vance. Your kitchen. Your food. It’s the last thing we know she ingested. We have to seal it.”

The bright yellow tape across the Dutch door screamed its presence. It pulled at the century-old paint with a faint, tearing sound that scraped at her nerves. Elara’s jaw tightened. This was her domain, and now it belonged to the law.

The silence between her and the officers thickened, a living thing. Their eyes measured her, cool and assessing. She straightened her spine, bracing for judgment. But in their gaze, beneath the official detachment, something else flickered. Not suspicion—curiosity. The day ahead would be long.

Their footsteps echoed on the tile as they moved through her space. Each click of a cabinet latch, each rustle of an evidence bag, shrank the room. The air grew dense, pressing against her skin. She needed to leave, to breathe.

“Ms. Vance.” Chief Henderson blocked her path to the door. “I need to ask you some questions. Can you tell me about last night’s dinner? Who was there, what was served?”

Her mind snapped back to the previous night—the clatter of pans, the roar of the range hood, the laughter bleeding through the pass-through. “A full house,” she said, her voice thin. “A party of eight, all strangers. Loud. Boisterous. They was enjoying themselves.” She paused, the memory turning sour. “We served duck, steak, seafood. The blueberry gastrique.”

Henderson’s eyes narrowed. “Did you notice anything unusual during the dinner?”

Elara sifted through the memories: the clink of glasses, the blur of servers swinging through the doors. She had been in the eye of the hurricane, focused only on the next plate, the next fire. The world beyond her mise en place had blurred into noise. “No. I was in the kitchen. I didn’t see the guests much.”

“I see.” He made a note. “We’ll need statements from you and your staff. And we’ll review the security footage.”

The security footage. Her stomach dropped. It would show every moment, every unguarded expression.

“One more thing, Ms. Vance.” Henderson’s pen hovered over his notebook. “The victim. Did you know her? Any interactions?”

The woman’s face surfaced in Elara’s mind—vivid auburn hair, a laugh that had carried into the kitchen. “She was a guest. We spoke a few times when I checked on the table. She was… friendly. Outgoing.”

The kitchen walls pressed closer. The metallic taste of panic coated her tongue. She had to get out.

When Henderson turned to speak to an officer, she slipped past, pushing through the heavy door into the courtyard.

The cold morning air hit her like a slap. She gulped it down, her lungs burning. Behind her, The Blueberry Inn loomed, its cheerful clapboard siding now a facade hiding chaos. She had to move.

She walked away, her boots crunching on the gravel drive. The town of Foxbridge stretched before her, a puzzle of steep roofs and winding lanes under the flat gray sky. Every curtain seemed to twitch. Every passerby on the distant main street glanced her way, then looked again.

She would find the truth. She would scrape the rot from her kitchen’s name.

As she strode toward the town, the silence gathered around her, heavy and watchful. The weight of its gaze settled on her shoulders. But in the glint of a shop window, in the quick, curious turn of a stranger’s head, she caught it again—that flicker of interest. It wasn’t much. But it was a place to start.
