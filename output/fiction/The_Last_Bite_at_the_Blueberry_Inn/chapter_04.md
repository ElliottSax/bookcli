Chapter 4: The Memoir's Missing Chapters

The rain-slick scent of hot asphalt clung to Elara from the regimented rows of Sweetwater Farm, a bitter cologne that fought the phantom chemical sweetness still coating her throat. She needed Leo Finch. Margot’s assistant had dissolved since the discovery of her body—a pale ghost in cashmere, vanished from his sunroom perch where his laptop had glowed like a watchful creature.

Hazel provided the thread, her polishing rag attacking the oak reception desk as if scrubbing away sin. “That nephew? Checked out this morning. White as a sheet. Said the… atmosphere disagreed with him.” Her voice dipped, the cloth circling tighter. “He’s at Cedar Crest. Cabin Three. Needed somewhere quiet to ‘process.’” She twisted the word. In Blueberry Harbor, “processing” was what newcomers did when the town’s quaint paint chipped, showing the granite underneath.

The Cedar Crest Cottages were a line of 1950s cabins decaying into the woods, where pavement crumbled to gravel and harbor salt surrendered to the damp rot of deep forest. Cabin Three’s porch light burned against the fading afternoon. A silver rental car sat beside it, spattered with mud and needles.

Elara knocked. Sound died in the hemlock grove. A shuffle answered, the peephole blackened, then locks clacked. Leo opened the door a slit—one bloodshot eye, a wedge of crumpled Oxford cloth.

“Elara. I’m not speaking to anyone.”

“Margot didn’t die from my food.” Elara kept her voice level, the tone that calmed sauté cooks with flaming pans. “Someone staged it. You knew her routines. You know what she was chasing.”

He jerked at Margot’s name. His gaze shot past her, scanning the empty lane. “It’s not safe.”

“I’m standing in the sheriff’s sights. You’re holding secrets. That makes us both targets.” She let the silence thicken. “Five minutes. I brought bread.”

She raised a brown bag. Warm, yeasted air escaped—a brioche loaf from The Crusty Bucket, butter melting through the paper. A peace offering, a language of kitchens. Leo’s shoulders caved. He opened the door.

The cabin reeked of transience and dread. A suitcase yawned on the sagging bed, clothes erupting. The desk nursed a nest of coffee cups and energy bar wrappers beside a closed laptop. Stale air hung heavy with cold brew and sweat.

“They’ve fixed on me.” Elara set the bag on the rickety table. “The duck. Our past. You watched her that night. Did anything seem wrong?”

A brittle laugh cracked from him. “Everything was wrong. Everything always was with Margot.” He collapsed into a plaid armchair, dragging hands through his hair. He looked twenty-five, with the delicate pallor of a grad student surviving on adrenaline and fear. Margot had been his thesis advisor, a fact he’d offered with pride at check-in. The pride had peeled away, leaving raw nerve.

“She was coiled tight all day.” His eyes fixed on the laptop. “Not her usual creative storm. This was cold. Precise. She’d finished the memoir revisions. ‘The Last Bite.’ She kept calling it that. I thought it was her flair. Now…” His voice frayed.

“The memoir.” Elara tore the brioche. The sound ripped the quiet, the crumb a burst of gold. She offered a piece. He accepted, staring at it like an artifact. “A tell-all about the harbor. Who was the target?”

He chewed, the simple act anchoring him. “Everyone.” Crumbs dusted his lip. “It began as charm—‘Charming Town, Charming Secrets.’ But Margot smelled decay under fresh paint. She found it.”

“What decay?”

His eyes sharpened on her. “You know the Maple Gold label?”

Elara nodded. The state’s premier grade, reserved for syrup of perfect clarity and density, tripling the price. Two local producers won it yearly.

“A sham.” Leo’s voice flattened. “Half of it. For years. She tracked invoices, chemical reports. They cut premium syrup with inferior stock, even import filler, and use political grease for the stamp. The grading committee head is the mayor’s cousin. The sheriff’s brother, Dale, runs the main bottling plant. He manages the blend.”

Elara’s mind raced. The mayor’s booming festival laugh. Sheriff Croft’s granite face. His brother Dale, a quiet man nursing coffee at the diner. A scheme that lucrative, exposed, would scorch the town’s artisanal myth.

“There’s more.” Leo’s words gained a shaky speed. “The land for the new ‘historic’ waterfront development? The deal was fixed. The old owner, Mr. Harrigan, got pressured into selling cheap. He died six months later. ‘Broken heart,’ they said. Margot had the threat letters, the doctored surveys. The mayor again. And the bakery.”

He pointed to the bread. “The Crusty Bucket. Their ‘signature’ wild blueberry scone? Stolen. From a woman named Eleanor Shaw who ran a tea shop here in the seventies. Margot found the original recipe card in Eleanor’s things at the historical society. Eleanor died poor. The bakery owner, Brenda, is Eleanor’s niece. She inherited the shop, ‘found’ the recipe in her ‘grandmother’s attic.’ It built her.”

A chill seeped into Elara’s bones. Brenda, flour-dusted and cheerful, her scones anchoring every town event. A beloved pillar resting on a theft. The memoir wasn’t exposing corruption; it planned to burn the whole village down.

“Why?” Elara’s breath clouded in the damp air. “Margot loved power, not rubble.”

Leo’s face contorted. “She called it the ultimate critique. Not of a single dish, but of an entire ecosystem of lies. Blueberry Harbor was the perfect meal with a rotten core. She would serve it to the world. And she saved the worst for last.”

He stood, pacing the thin carpet. “The final chapter. Not about syrup or land or recipes. A death. A girl. Sarah Ketchum. Twenty years back.”

The name meant nothing. Leo saw her blank look.

“Seventeen. Worked part-time at the syrup plant. They found her at the bottom of the quarry lake on Sweetwater’s edge. Ruled an accident. A tragic slip after a party. Margot disagreed. An anonymous letter years ago pointed her here. She dug. She believed Sarah saw something at the plant about the syrup operation. She believed someone made sure she never spoke.”

Sweetwater Farm. The quarry lake on its border. Liam Walsh’s terrified eyes, his pristine fields. A man guarding more than berries.

“Who?”

“She had no name. Not yet. But she was close. She said the answer lived in the ‘first harvest.’ She met someone the night she died. Wouldn’t tell me who. Said it was too dangerous for me to know.” His laugh dried out. “As if working for her wasn’t danger defined. I hated her.”

The admission lay bare between them. He startled at his own words.

“She was a tyrant. Brilliant. She’d shred you over a comma, then buy you a thousand-dollar suit because you needed to ‘present better.’ I was a slave to her whims, addicted to the terror of her disapproval. I dreamed of quitting. I was also addicted to her power’s proximity. Until this. This was evil. And I was too cowardly to walk away or warn anyone.”

His confession hung, raw and human. It rang truer than any innocence. Elara saw him now—not Margot’s appendage, but another victim in her gilded cage.

“The manuscript, Leo. The evidence. Where?”

He knelt, opened the laptop, keys clacking. “She was paranoid. Everything’s encrypted. Local copies, cloud backups. She gave me the key. A passphrase. ‘The first harvest is the deepest cut.’ Morbid. My orders: send it to her publisher if anything happened.” Guilt etched his face. “I haven’t. I’m scared. What if they come for me next?”

He plugged in a tiny drive, copied a folder. “Here. Drafts, scanned documents, audio notes. For God’s sake, be careful.”

Elara took the cool drive. Its weight far exceeded its size. A town’s soul in binary code.

“Leave, Leo. Tonight. Go back to the city.”

“I will. First light. I just… need one night to find my nerve.”

She pressed him to go now, but fear had petrified him. She left him standing in the gloom, the scent of brioche tangling with despair.

The drive back blurred—maple schemes, stolen scones, a dead girl in a quarry. The pieces lay sharp, but refused to fit without the shape of Sarah Ketchum’s death to bind them.

In her apartment over the kitchen, Elara inserted the drive. The folder revealed a labyrinth. She started with audio notes, clicking “SK – Quarry.”

Margot’s voice filled the room—crisp, intelligent, arctic. “The official report omits masterfully. No water in the lungs. Sarah didn’t drown. She was dead before she hit the water. Blunt force trauma to the occipital bone. A ‘fall,’ they said. The angle was wrong. The party? Convenient fiction. She was seen arguing with someone by the plant’s loading dock that night. A man. Not a boy. A man. The ‘first harvest’ reference in the anonymous letter must mean the early sap run. That’s when she died. That’s when she saw something. The first harvest is the deepest cut. It holds the truth.”

Elara scrolled through scans: a grainy yearbook photo of Sarah Ketchum smiling; the autopsy’s clinical language; a faded quarry image ringed by pines. Then, a recent photo taken through a telephoto lens. Two men talking in the shadow of the syrup plant’s silos. Dale Croft, the sheriff’s brother. And Liam Walsh, the organic farmer. Their bodies spoke tension, not friendship. An exchange. The timestamp: three weeks ago.

The connection locked, cold and hard. Liam Walsh supplied organic feedstock for value-added products. Was he tangled in the syrup scheme? Was his terror about more than pesticides? Was the pristine farm a mask?

She was assembling it—the culinary forensics of the crime. The poison wasn’t in her food; it was in something only Margot would consume. Something that whispered of the town. A welcome gift. A small jar of—

A sudden, jarring noise shattered her focus—the distant, relentless blare of a car horn, muffled but screaming.

Ice coiled in her stomach. Leo.

She ran downstairs, snatched her keys, and sped into the clotting dark. The horn swelled, a desperate mechanical wail in the silent woods. She skidded onto the gravel lane.

Cabin Three. The rental car idled, dome light on, illuminating a grotesque scene. Leo slumped sideways in the driver’s seat, head against the window, mouth slack. The horn blared from under his limp arm.

Elara wrenched the door open. A faint, sweet stink—not maple, but exhaust—mixed with pine. Carbon monoxide. She hauled him out, muscles shrieking, onto the cold gravel. He breathed in shallow hitches, a threadbare pulse fluttering at his throat.

She called 911, voice cracking. Her eyes swept the car. A new garden hose snaked from the exhaust pipe to a gap in the driver’s window, sealed with duct tape. A classic, clumsy suicide setup.

But the duct tape fixed to the window’s outside. The hose ends were cut clean, not torn. This wasn’t the work of a paralyzed young man in panic. This was staged. Someone had tried to silence Leo Finch, to dress his fear as its final, logical act.

As the first sirens cut the thick night, Elara looked down at Leo’s ashen face. Margot’s memoir had threatened to expose the town’s rotten core. Now the core was fighting back. It had just shown a willingness to kill again, to keep its secrets buried.

The first harvest, she understood with visceral clarity, was indeed the deepest cut. And the blade was still swinging.
