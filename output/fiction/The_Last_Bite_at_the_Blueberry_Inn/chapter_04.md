Chapter 4: The Memoir's Missing Chapters

Chapter 4: The Memoir’s Missing Chapters

The scent of rain on hot asphalt followed Elara from the pristine, terrifying rows of Sweetwater Farm. It clung to her as she drove back to the Inn, a counterpoint to the phantom smell of chemical sweetness that now seemed to linger in her sinuses. She needed to find Leo Finch. Margot’s assistant had been a ghost since the discovery of her body—a pale, anxious specter in expensive sweaters, now vanished from his usual perch in the Inn’s sunroom, laptop glowing like a malevolent eye.

It was Hazel, polishing the vast oak reception desk with the fervor of someone trying to erase a stain from history, who gave her the thread to pull.

“That young man? Mr. Finch’s nephew, or something? He checked out this morning. Pale as milk. Said he couldn’t bear the… the atmosphere.” Hazel’s voice dropped, her cloth moving in tight, nervous circles. “He’s over at the Cedar Crest Cottages. Number three. Said he needed somewhere quiet to ‘process.’” The word was delivered with a subtle, knowing twist. In Blueberry Harbor, “processing” was what outsiders did when the town’s cozy veneer cracked, revealing the old, hard granite beneath.

The Cedar Crest Cottages were a string of 1950s-era tourist cabins, once charming, now just weathering. They sat on the northern edge of town, where the pavement gave way to gravel and the scent of salt and pine from the harbor was replaced by the damp, fungal smell of the deep woods closing in. Cabin Three’s porch light was on, though dusk was still an hour away. A small, silver rental car was parked beside it, speckled with mud and pine needles.

Elara knocked. The sound was swallowed by the thick grove of hemlocks behind the cabins. She heard a furtive shuffle, the peephole darkening for a moment, then the click of locks. Leo opened the door just wide enough to reveal one frightened eye and a slice of his rumpled Oxford shirt.

“Ms. Vance. I’m not… I don’t want to talk to anyone.”

“I know,” Elara said, her voice low but firm, the one she used to talk down a spooked line cook during a dinner rush. “But Margot didn’t die from my food, Leo. Someone made it look that way. And you knew her better than anyone here. You know what she was working on.”

He flinched at Margot’s name. His gaze darted past her, scanning the empty gravel lane. “It’s not safe.”

“It’s less safe for me, sitting in the sheriff’s crosshairs. And for you, if you know something and they think you’ll talk.” She let the implication hang in the cool, damp air. “Five minutes. I brought sustenance.”

She lifted a brown paper bag. The scent of warm, yeasted bread and melted butter escaped its confines—a brioche loaf from The Crusty Bucket, the town bakery, still faintly steaming. It was a disarming weapon, a language of comfort. Leo’s shoulders slumped. He opened the door.

The cabin was a study in transient dread. A single suitcase lay open on the sagging bed, clothes spilling out as if packed in a panic. The small desk was a nest of empty coffee cups, energy bar wrappers, and a sleek, silver laptop, closed. The air was stale, thick with the smell of cold coffee and male anxiety.

“They think I did it,” Elara said, placing the bag on the rickety table. “Because of the duck. Because of our history. You were there. You saw her that night. Was there anything… off?”

Leo gave a short, brittle laugh. “Everything was off. Everything always was with Margot.” He sank into a worn plaid armchair, running a hand through his already-tousled hair. He was young, maybe twenty-five, with the delicate, under-slept look of a doctoral student in a punishing program. Margot Finch had been his thesis advisor once, a fact he’d mentioned with pride on check-in. The pride was gone now, scraped away to reveal raw terror.

“She was in a state all day,” he said, his eyes on the closed laptop. “Not her usual creative fury. This was colder. Surgical. She’d finished the final revisions on the memoir. ‘The Last Bite.’ She kept calling it that. I thought it was just her dramatic flair. Now…” He trailed off.

“The memoir,” Elara pressed gently, tearing a piece of the brioche. The sound was obscenely loud, the crumb impossibly golden and soft. She handed it to him. He took it automatically, staring at it as if it were a foreign artifact. “It was a tell-all about Blueberry Harbor. Who was it telling all on?”

Leo took a bite, chewing slowly. The simple, buttery act seemed to ground him. “Everyone,” he whispered, crumbs catching on his lip. “It started as a puff piece—‘Charming Town, Charming Secrets.’ But Margot had a nose for rot. She could smell it under the freshest coat of paint, the sweetest jam. She found it.”

“What kind of rot?”

He looked at her, his eyes finally focusing. “You’re a food person. You know about the Maple Gold label?”

Elara nodded. The state’s Maple Gold designation was a prestigious grade, reserved for syrup of exceptional clarity, density, and flavor. It commanded triple the price. Blueberry Harbor had two producers who consistently won it.

“It’s a sham,” Leo said flatly. “At least half of it. Has been for years. She traced invoices, chemical analyses. They’re cutting premium syrup with inferior stock, even imported filler, and using their political clout to guarantee the Gold stamp. The head of the grading committee is the mayor’s cousin. The sheriff’s brother, Dale, runs the biggest bottling plant. He’s the one who orchestrates the blend.”

Elara’s mind raced. The mayor, with his booming voice and back-slapping bonhomie at every town festival. Sheriff Croft, stern and unyielding. His brother Dale, a quieter man, always seen at the plant or the diner, nursing a coffee. A scheme that lucrative, exposed, would ruin them. It would unravel the town’s carefully cultivated image of artisanal purity.

“That’s not all,” Leo continued, his voice gaining a shaky momentum. “The land for the new ‘historic’ waterfront development? The one that’s going to have ‘artisan shops’? The deal was greased. The previous owner, old Mr. Harrigan, was pressured into selling far below value. He died six months later. Broken heart, they said. Margot had the threatening letters, the doctored surveyor reports. The mayor was in on that, too. And the bakery.”

He gestured to the bread. “The Crusty Bucket. Their ‘signature’ wild blueberry scone? The recipe was stolen. From a woman named Eleanor Shaw, who ran a tea shop here in the seventies. Margot found the original recipe card in a box of Eleanor’s things at the historical society. Eleanor died penniless. The bakery owner, Brenda, is Eleanor’s niece. She inherited the shop, ‘found’ the recipe in her ‘grandmother’s attic.’ It built her empire.”

Elara felt a chill that had nothing to do with the damp cabin. She thought of Brenda, flour-dusted and cheerful, her scones the cornerstone of every town meeting, every charity bake sale. A beloved pillar, built on a theft. The memoir wasn’t just exposing corruption; it was poised to salt the earth of the entire community.

“Why?” Elara breathed. “Why would Margot do this? She loved wielding power, not destroying towns.”

Leo’s face twisted. “She said it was the ultimate critique. Not of a single dish, but of an entire ecosystem of deception. She said Blueberry Harbor was the perfect meal with a rotten core. She was going to serve it to the world. And she saved the worst for last.”

He stood abruptly, pacing the thin carpet. “The final chapter. It wasn’t about syrup or land or recipes. It was about a death. A girl. Sarah Ketchum. Twenty years ago.”

The name meant nothing to Elara. Leo saw her blank look.

“She was seventeen. Worked part-time at the syrup plant. They found her at the bottom of the old quarry lake on the edge of Sweetwater Farm. Ruled an accident. A tragic slip after a party. Margot didn’t think so. She’d gotten a tip, an anonymous letter sent to her years ago about another story, pointing her here. She started digging. She believed Sarah saw something at the plant. Something about the syrup operation. And she believed someone made sure she never talked.”

Sweetwater Farm. The quarry lake was on its far border. Elara thought of Liam Walsh’s terrified eyes, his impossibly pristine fields. A man guarding more than berries.

“Who?” she asked.

“She didn’t have a name. Not yet. But she was close. She said the answer was in the ‘first harvest.’ She was meeting someone the night she died. She wouldn’t tell me who. She said it was too dangerous for me to know.” His laugh was a dry, broken thing. “As if working for her wasn’t the definition of danger. I hated her, you know.”

The admission hung in the air, stark and ugly. He looked shocked he’d said it.

“She was a tyrant. A brilliant, mesmerizing tyrant. She’d shred your confidence over a misplaced comma, then buy you a thousand-dollar suit because she needed you to ‘present better.’ I was a slave to her whims, to the terror of her disapproval. I dreamed of quitting. But I was also… addicted. To the proximity to her power. Until this. This was different. This was evil. And I was too much of a coward to walk away or to warn anyone.”

His confession was raw, human. It rang truer than any protestation of innocence. Elara saw him then not as an extension of Margot, but as another of her victims, trapped in her gilded cage.

“The manuscript, Leo. The evidence. Where is it?”

He knelt by his laptop, opened it, and typed rapidly. “She was paranoid. It’s all encrypted. Local copies, cloud backups. She gave me the decryption key. A passphrase. ‘The first harvest is the deepest.’ Morbid. She said I was to send it to her publisher if anything happened to her.” He looked up, guilt etching his features. “I haven’t. I’m too scared. What if they come for me next?”

He plugged in a small external drive and copied a folder. “Here. This is everything. The drafts, the scanned documents, the audio notes. For God’s sake, be careful.”

Elara took the small, cool drive, feeling its weight far exceed its physical mass. It was a town’s soul, in binary code.

“You should leave, Leo. Tonight. Go back to the city.”

“I will. First thing in the morning. I just… I need one night to get my nerve.”

She urged him again to leave immediately, but the paralysis of fear was on him. He was rooted to the spot. Finally, she left him there, standing in the gloom of the cabin, the scent of brioche now mingling with despair.

The drive back to the Inn was a blur of swirling thoughts—maple syrup schemes, stolen scones, a dead girl in a quarry. The pieces were there, sharp and jagged, but they wouldn’t fit. Not without the shape of Sarah Ketchum’s death to bind them.

Back in her apartment over the Inn’s kitchen, Elara inserted the drive. The folder opened, revealing a labyrinth of files. She started with the audio notes, clicking on one labeled “SK – Quarry.”

Margot’s voice filled the quiet room, crisp, intelligent, and utterly cold. “The official report is a masterpiece of omission. No water in the lungs. Sarah didn’t drown. She was dead before she hit the water. Blunt force trauma to the occipital bone. A ‘fall,’ they said. But the angle was all wrong. And the party? A convenient fiction. She was seen arguing with someone by the syrup plant’s loading dock that night. A man. Not a boy. A man. The ‘first harvest’ reference in the anonymous letter must refer to the early sap run. That’s when she died. That’s when she saw something. The first harvest is the deepest cut. It holds the truth.”

Elara scrolled through scanned images: a grainy yearbook photo of a smiling Sarah Ketchum; the stark, clinical language of the autopsy report; a faded photo of the quarry, ringed with pines like sentinels. Then, a more recent photo, taken secretly through a telephoto lens. It showed two men talking in the shadow of the syrup plant’s silos. One was Dale Croft, the sheriff’s brother. The other was Liam Walsh, the organic farmer. Their body language was tense, not friendly. An exchange, not a chat. The timestamp was from three weeks ago.

The connection snapped into place, cold and hard. Liam Walsh supplied organic feed stock for value-added products. Could he be involved in the syrup scheme? Was his terror not just about pesticides, but about being implicated in something far darker? Was the pristine farm a cover?

She was piecing it together, the culinary forensics of the crime becoming clear. The poison hadn’t been in her food; it had been in something else Margot consumed that only she would have. Something that spoke of the town. A welcome gift, perhaps. A small jar of something…

A sudden, jarring noise broke her concentration—the distant, repetitive blare of a car horn, muffled but insistent. It was coming from the direction of the Cedar Crest Cottages.

A cold knot tightened in her stomach. Leo.

She ran downstairs, grabbed her car keys, and sped back into the gathering night. The horn grew louder, a desperate, mechanical scream in the silent woods. As she skidded onto the gravel lane, she saw it.

Cabin Three. The rental car was running, its interior dome light on, illuminating a ghastly scene. Leo was slumped sideways in the driver’s seat, his head against the window, mouth slack. The horn was pinned under his limp arm.

Elara wrenched the car door open. A faint, sweetish smell—not maple, but exhaust—mixed with the damp pine air. Carbon monoxide. She dragged him out, her muscles screaming, onto the cold gravel. He was breathing, but shallowly, a faint, ragged pulse fluttering in his throat.

She called 911, her voice shaking. As she waited, her eyes scanned the car. A garden hose, brand new, ran from the exhaust pipe to a gap in the driver’s side window, sealed with duct tape. A classic, clumsy suicide setup.

But the duct tape on the window was on the outside. And the hose was too neatly fitted, the ends cut cleanly, not torn. This wasn’t the work of a terrified, paralyzed young man in the throes of a panic. This was staged. Someone had tried to silence Leo Finch, to make his fear look like its final, logical conclusion.

As the first sirens wailed in the distance, cutting through the thick night, Elara looked down at Leo’s ashen face. Margot’s memoir had threatened to expose the town’s rotten core. Now, it seemed, the core was fighting back. And it had just proven it was willing to kill again to keep its secrets buried. The first harvest, she thought with a new, visceral understanding, was indeed the deepest cut. And the blade was still very much in hand.
