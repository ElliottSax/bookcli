Chapter 3: Bitter Harvest

The morning mist clung to the hills like a shroud, tasting of damp earth and the distant, cold promise of the sea. Elara drove the winding back road out of Blueberry Cove with the windows down, but the scent of pine and brine did little to clear the claustrophobia that had settled in her chest since finding Margot Finch’s body. The police had been polite, thorough, and utterly opaque. She was “assisting with their inquiries,” which, in the tight-lipped world of Chief Henderson, meant she was the only visible thread in a tapestry of silence. Her kitchen was no longer wholly her own; a forensics team had taken samples of everything from her sea salt to her vanilla extract, their presence a silent, accusatory stain.

She needed air that wasn’t filtered through the inn’s floral wallpaper and whispered suspicions. She needed answers that didn’t come in the form of sideways glances from the few remaining guests. Most of all, she needed to understand where her ingredients came from. A forensic chef knew that poison was rarely an accident; it was a choice, a deliberate contamination of a chain. And her chain began here, at the source.

Bramble Hill Farm emerged from the mist not as a picture of rustic charm, but as a fortress of quiet order. Unlike the other farms in the valley, with their cheerful, slightly ramshackle barns and riotous wildflower borders, Bramble Hill was austere. The fields of blueberries, row upon precise row, were militarily neat, without a weed in sight, the bushes heavy with fruit that seemed almost too uniformly plump and blue. The farmhouse was a low-slung, gray-shingled affair, its windows clean but blank. The only sign of life was a thin, persistent column of smoke from a field incinerator, burning something that gave off a faint, acrid odor—nothing like wood.

Elara parked her old Volvo beside a meticulously organized tool shed. The silence was profound, broken only by the drip-drip of moisture falling from the gutters. As she stepped out, the rich loam of the path deadened her footsteps. She felt watched.

“Can I help you?”

The voice made her jump. He stood in the shadow of the farmhouse porch, a man perhaps in his late fifties, lean as a whip, with hands that were a topographical map of scars and calluses. Owen. She’d only seen him at the weekly farmers’ market, where he’d sit silently behind his pristine berry cart, his prices higher than anyone else’s, his demeanor discouraging chatter.

“Owen? Hi. Elara Vance, from the Blueberry Inn. I wanted to talk to you about the berries.”

He didn’t move. “You got your delivery yesterday. Same as every week. Is there a problem?”

His voice was gravelly, guarded. Elara chose her words like she was selecting knives for a delicate boning job. “No problem with the quality. Never. They’re perfect. That’s actually what I wanted to talk about. They’re always perfect.”

A flicker in his eyes. Wariness. “That’s the point.”

“It is. But in nature, perfect
