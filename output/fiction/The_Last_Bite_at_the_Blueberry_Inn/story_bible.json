Suspecting the victim was actually the infamous critic, Elara digs into the inn's guest records and Margot's past, uncovering a shocking connection: Margot was the granddaughter of Agnes Finch, the inn's original owner and author of its prized cookbook. Margot had come not to review, but to steal the cookbook\u2014the last piece of her grandmother's legacy\u2014to jumpstart her own failing career. The confrontation led to her accidental death. In the aftermath, Elara and Leo choose to protect the inn's reputation by concealing the full truth.
