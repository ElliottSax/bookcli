The air in the mayor’s study was thick with the smell of old paper, lemon polish, and the cloying sweetness of panic. Rough twine bit into Elara Vance’s wrists. Mayor Hendricks loomed over his desk, his usual friendly charm stripped away, leaving a face pale and slick with sweat under the green-shaded lamp. The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed, a thin, electric vibration that matched the tension in the room.

“It didn’t have to be this way, Elara Vance,” he said, his voice low and strained. He fumbled with a set of keys, his hands trembling. The worn leather of his suit jacket clung to his frame, as if it too was suffocating. “You were supposed to just… let it lie. Let the town have its peace. Its prosperity.”

Elara tested the bonds, not with violence, but with subtle, persistent pressure. She fixed her attention on the world outside the leaded-glass windows, where the distant, joyful noise of the Blueberry Festival swelled. The brassy oom-pah of the town band, the rise and fall of crowd noise, the faint, sugary scent of frying dough and berry compote carried on the evening breeze—it was a lifeline. The opposite of this quiet, desperate room. She could almost taste the sweetness of the festival, the tang of blueberries, the richness of buttery pastry.

“Prosperity built on a stolen legacy and a body,” Elara said, her voice calm. It was the calm of the kitchen before service, the focused stillness before the chaos. “You didn’t kill him, though, did you? You couldn’t stomach the hands-on work. You just provided the stage. And the motive.”

Hendricks finally found the right key and unlocked a small, ornate drawer. It creaked open, revealing a stack of yellowed papers and a small, leather-bound journal. Elara recognized it: Finch’s handwritten recipe book, the one she’d seen glimpses of in the Inn’s kitchen. The worn cover held the history of countless hands.

“He called this ‘simply family notes.’” Hendricks’s knuckles whitened around the journal. “It’s a blueprint for an empire. My empire.”

The pages were filled with recipes, notes and annotations dancing across the paper in faded ink. A book of secrets, of traditions passed down through generations. And at the center of it all, Margot Finch Hughes.

“So you convinced someone else that Finch was a villain who deserved more than just a stolen book,” Elara pressed, working her thumb against a loose loop in the twine. The chemistry. The specific, rare compound. It had nagged at her, a wrong note in the recipe of the crime. “You found someone whose grief was fresher, whose anger was sharper. Someone who knew their way around a chemical cabinet.”

Hendricks’s eyes flickered. A shadow of guilt, or merely fear of exposure? The faint scent of his cologne, once familiar and comforting, now clung to him like a bad omen. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Clara Wilkins.” Elara let the name hang in the air like a challenge. The pristine chemistry teacher, the pillar of the community. Her gaze locked onto Hendricks, sharp and unblinking. “You used her. You used her grief and her anger to further your own ends.”

Silence stretched, broken only by the distant festival music. The mayor’s eyes darted to the door, then back to the journal in his hands. A bead of sweat traced a path from his temple to his jaw.

“She loved him, you know,” Hendricks whispered, the words escaping like a confession. “Old Finch. In her own, quiet way. When he dismissed her… when he called her work ‘common’…” He shook his head, his gaze dropping to the desk. “It wasn’t hard to point that devotion in another direction. To suggest the legacy should belong to someone who truly valued it.”

Elara’s thumb found the give in the twine. A loop loosened. “You gave her the compound. The one that mimics a heart attack. You told her it was a way to discredit him, to make him sick, to take the book while he was weak.”

“It was only supposed to make him ill!” The mayor’s voice cracked. He slammed the journal shut. “A temporary setback. A scandal to make him sell. She was the one who changed the dosage. She was the one who went into his room that night.”

The admission sucked the air from the room. The cheerful oom-pah outside sounded grotesque, a mockery.

Elara’s hands, now free, remained still at her sides. “And you’ve been paying for her silence ever since. With town contracts for her nephew. With grants for her lab. All while you built your empire on Finch’s recipes.”

Hendricks didn’t deny it. He just stared at the closed journal, a man staring at the foundation of his own ruin.

Outside, the festival crowd roared in approval for some unseen spectacle. In the study, the only sound was the ragged pull of the mayor’s breath. The battle wasn’t with fists or weapons, but with truth, and it had just found its mark.
