Chapter 9: The Sweetest Alibi

The rain had settled into a persistent, whispering drizzle, blurring the warm lights of the Blueberry Inn into smears of gold against the charcoal evening. Inside, the air still hummed with the ghost of adrenaline from Elara’s reckless experiment. The taste of the recreated dessert—the safe, non-lethal version—lingered on her tongue, a cloying reminder of how close she had danced to the edge. It had worked. The police, reluctantly, had crossed her name off their list. But the victory felt hollow, a single cleared step in a minefield.

Her focus had sharpened to a needlepoint: the cyanide. Not common potassium cyanide, but a specific, rare compound—sodium cyanoborohydride. A reducing agent used in organic chemistry. And in delicate, clandestine jam-making, to preserve the vivid, impossible color of fruit without cooking it to death. The kind of trick a master preserver might know. Or a master chemist.

Which led her, the next afternoon, to the immaculate, echoing halls of Haven’s End High School. The scent was a potent mix of industrial cleaner, old paper, and the faint, metallic tang of fear that seemed to seep from the lockers. Elara’s destination was the science wing, and more specifically, the chemistry classroom of Mr. Alistair Finch.

Everyone in town knew Alistair Finch. He was a pillar—trim, silver-haired, with a smile that was both kind and precise. He ran the astronomy club, judged the middle school science fair, and his blueberry-ginger preserves had taken the blue ribbon at the county fair for fifteen years running. His reputation was spotless, polished like the glassware in his lab.

Elara paused outside Room 214. The door was open. Inside, Finch was wiping down a blackboard, every stroke of the eraser methodical, leaving no ghost of an equation behind. The room was a temple to order. Beakers gleamed in neat rows on shelves, elemental posters were aligned with military precision, and the only personal touch was a single, framed photograph on his desk. From the doorway, Elara could just make out two women, arms slung around each other’s shoulders in front of a blooming lilac bush, their smiles wide and bright with a forgotten summer.

“Can I help you?”

Finch’s voice was as clean as his classroom. He hadn’t turned around.

“Mr. Finch? I’m Elara Vance. From the inn.”

He turned, the eraser in his hand. His eyes, a pale, intelligent blue behind wire-rimmed glasses, assessed her. There was no surprise in them. “Ah. The chef. I heard about your… culinary demonstration yesterday. Bold.” He placed the eraser in its tray, aligned it perfectly with the edge of the blackboard. “I assume this isn’t about tutoring.”

“I’m looking into the history of the inn,” Elara said, stepping inside. The lie felt flimsy under his gaze. “Margot’s memoir mentioned a cook who died there, a long time ago. In a fire. I was wondering if you knew anything. Being a longtime resident.”

Something shifted behind his eyes, a shutter clicking closed. He walked to his desk, his hand briefly brushing the framed photograph before he moved it slightly, turning it away from her. “That was a tragedy. A young woman named Clara. Very talented, they said. The fire was an accident. Faulty wiring in the old kitchen.”

“You remember it?”

“I was a teenager. The whole town remembered.” He began to sort papers into a leather satchel. “It was a loss.”

Elara ventured closer. The photograph was now angled such that she could see the other woman. She had Margot’s defiant eyes, but softer. “Was that Clara?” she asked, nodding to the picture.

Finch’s movements stilled for a fraction of a second. “No,” he said, his voice softer now. “That is my mother, Eleanor. And her dearest friend, Margot.”

The connection snapped into place, sharp and cold. Her mother was the partner of the cook who died in the fire. “They were close?”

“Inseparable.” He closed the satchel with a definitive click. “They created things together. Recipes. Jams. A whole world of flavor in my mother’s kitchen. It was their language.” He looked at Elara, and for the first time, she saw a crack in the calm facade, a deep, old weariness. “Until the fire. And after the fire, the theft.”

“Theft?”

“Their recipe journal. A leather-bound book, stained with berry juice and vanilla. It vanished from the ashes. My mother believed it survived. She believed someone took it.” He took off his glasses, polishing them on his immaculate lab coat. “She spent years looking for it. It was the last piece of Clara. The last piece of them. She… dwindled. And then, she left.”

The way he said ‘left’ held a universe of quiet despair. Suicide. Margot’s memoir wouldn’t just have hinted at an old tragedy; it would have laid bare Eleanor Finch’s heartbreaking decline, the direct consequence of that theft. It would have exposed a wound Alistair had spent a lifetime carefully bandaging with respectability.

“Mr. Finch,” Elara said, her voice gentle. “The night Margot was killed. The police said you have an alibi.”

He replaced his glasses. The compassionate mask was back, but it looked strained at the edges. “The overnight astronomy club. Twelve students. We were in the planetarium, then on the observation deck until dawn. Sheriff Briggs confirmed it. Quite rock-solid, I’m afraid.” A faint, humorless smile touched his lips. “I was right here, under the stars, while poor Margot was… well.”

He was ushering her out now, his body language a clear dismissal. But as she turned to go, her eyes caught on a ledger book open on a side table, labeled Astronomy Club – Observation Log. Next to it, a powerful telescope on a tripod pointed out the large, rain-streaked window toward the now-cloudy sky.

“Do you mind?” she asked, pointing to the log. “I’ve always been fascinated by the stars.”

“By all means,” he said, but his tone had cooled.

Elara flipped through the pages. Neat columns recorded dates, times, students’ names, and celestial objects observed. The night of the murder was meticulously documented: 11:30 PM – Jupiter, Saturn. 12:15 AM – Andromeda Galaxy. 1:00 AM – Orion Nebula. Then, an entry: 1:45 AM – 2:45 AM. Cloud cover. Observations halted. Students in planetarium for lecture.

An hour. A solid, documented block of time where the club was not actively observing. Where Alistair Finch, the proctor, was presumably giving a lecture indoors. The school was a ten-minute drive from the inn.

Her heart began a slow, heavy thud. She looked out the window. The clouds were thick, but they were the same clouds that had been there all day. A dedicated astronomer would have noted increasing cirrus, or high-altitude haze. Not a blanket ‘cloud cover’ that halted everything for exactly sixty minutes.

“A full hour of clouds,” she murmured, almost to herself.

“It was unfortunate,” Finch said from directly behind her, making her jump. He was closer than she’d realized. “But it gave me a chance to review stellar parallax with the students. A valuable lesson in patience.”

His breath smelled of mint and, faintly, of bitter almonds. A common scent, she told herself. From his tea. It had to be from his tea.

“Of course,” Elara said, shutting the log. She needed to get out, to think. “Thank you for your time, Mr. Finch.”

“Miss Vance,” he said as she reached the door. She turned. He was standing in the center of his pristine lab, a figure of absolute, rational order. “History is a fragile thing. It can be erased by fire. By theft. By a careless word in a memoir. We build our lives on the stories we preserve. Be careful which ones you choose to dig up.”

The warning was as clear and cold as distilled water.

Back at the inn, the kitchen was her sanctuary. Elara needed to work with her hands, to lose herself in the alchemy of flour and butter. She was making shortcrust pastry, the rhythmic rubbing of fat into flour a calming mantra. The swish-swish of her fingers, the cool, yielding texture, the promise of structure.
