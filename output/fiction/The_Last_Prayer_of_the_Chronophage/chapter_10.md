 over the room, and for a heartbeat, the Cage flickered. The puddle of water showed a city that had never been built. The chair became a black hole, its edges crumbling into nothingness. Elara’s reflection in the puddle was not her own. It was the face of a woman she had never met, her eyes filled with a sorrow that had not yet happened.

But the Cage held. The paradoxes were too rich, too dense. The Chronophage could not consume them all at once. It was a predator, but it was also a creature of habit, of pattern. It had always fed on the simple, the linear. The Cage was a feast of contradictions, a banquet of impossible moments.

Elara took a step forward, her bare feet pressing into the cold, cracked linoleum. The floor was both solid and insubstantial, a surface that existed in multiple states at once. She felt the weight of the world pressing down on her, the weight of every possible future and every impossible past. The air smelled of burnt sugar and the metallic tang of blood, but also of rain on hot pavement, of fresh-cut grass, of the ozone that lingers after a storm.

“You are bound,” she repeated, her voice steady now. “By the rules of the call. By the grammar of the summoning. The prayer that pulled you here… it has a syntax. A logic. Even you… must obey it.”

The Chronophage pulsed again, and the room shuddered. The walls seemed to breathe, to expand and contract like the lungs of some great beast. The puddle of water showed a forest that had never grown, a city that had never been destroyed. The chair was a swirling vortex of time, its edges dissolving into the void.

Elara felt a surge of something—hope, perhaps, or madness. She could not tell the difference. She took another step forward, her body trembling with the effort of standing in the presence of such a force. The air was thick with the scent of burnt copper and the faint, ghostly perfume of a memory that had not yet been made.

“You are bound,” she said, her voice rising. “By the rules of the call. By the grammar of the summoning. The prayer that pulled you here… it has a syntax. A logic. Even you… must obey it.”

The Chronophage pulsed once more, and the room seemed to tear at the seams. The walls were no longer walls, but a shifting mix of moments, of memories, of possibilities. The puddle of water showed a world that had never been, a future that had never come to pass. The chair was a black hole, a singularity of time and space, its edges crumbling into nothingness.
