glass shattered, the sound a gunshot in the quiet room. She didn’t flinch. She was beyond flinching.
The phone rang. She stared at it, the shrill tone an intrusion. It rang again. She picked it up.
“Elara.” Silas’s voice was tight, controlled. “You need to come to the lab. Now.”

“No.” Her voice was a rasp. “I’m not going back there. I’m not touching that thing again.”

“You don’t understand. It’s not the translation. It’s you. The prayer isn’t just a sequence. It’s a key that fits a lock. And the lock is you.”

She didn’t ask what he meant. She already knew. The memory-lapses, the emotional amputations. The Chronophage wasn’t just feeding. It was learning. And it had found a way in.
She hung up the phone. The silence in the room was absolute. She could hear the hum of the refrigerator, the distant thrum of traffic, the creak of the building settling. All the sounds of a world that was still there, even if the reasons for them were gone.
She walked to the window. The city stretched out before her, a grid of lights, a mix of—

She stopped. The word “pattern” had come unbidden, a cliché, a phrase that belonged in a travel brochure or a bad novel. She hadn’t thought it. The thought had been placed there, like a memory that wasn’t hers.
The Chronophage was inside her.
She turned away from the window, her heart pounding. She needed to think. To plan. But the thoughts were slippery, the connections between them fragile, as if the very act of thinking was a house of cards, and the wind was picking up.
She picked up the phone again. Dialed a number.
“Hello?” A man’s voice, groggy with sleep.
“Daniel.” Her voice was steady. “I need you to come over. Now.”

“Elara? It’s 3 AM. What’s—”

“Simply come. And bring your camera.”

She hung up. Daniel was a photographer, a friend from grad school. He’d understand. He’d see. She needed a witness.
The minutes stretched. She paced, her bare feet silent on the hardwood. The apartment too large, the spaces between the furniture too vast. She kept expecting the walls to lean, the floor to tilt, the ceiling to sag under the weight of the erasures.
A knock at the door. She opened it. Daniel stood there, his camera bag slung over his shoulder, his hair tousled, his eyes bleary. He took one look at her and frowned.
“You look like hell.”

She stepped aside. “Come in.”

He did, his gaze immediately drawn to the shattered photograph on the floor. “What happened?”

“Sit down.” She gestured to the couch. He did, his movements slow, cautious, as if he was afraid the furniture might collapse under him.
She sat across from him, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. “Daniel, I need you to do something for me. I need you to take a picture. Of me.”

He blinked. “Now? In the middle of the night?”

“Yes. Now. And I need you to take a picture of the picture on the floor. The one that’s broken.”

He hesitated, then reached for his camera. He snapped a shot of the photograph, then turned to her. She sat still, her expression neutral, her eyes fixed on the lens.
He took the picture.
She didn’t look at the display. She didn’t need to. She could see it in her mind’s eye. The photograph would be perfect. The image of a woman sitting on a couch, her face calm, her eyes steady. But the woman in the photograph would be a stranger. The details would be there—the shape of her face, the color of her hair, the clothes she was wearing. But the essence, the spark that made it her, would be gone. The photograph would be a lie.
“You see it, don’t you?” she asked softly.
Daniel swallowed. “I don’t know what I’m seeing. But I know it’s wrong.”

She nodded. “It’s not just the photograph. It’s everything. The memories, the emotions, the connections. They’re being eaten. One by one.”

Daniel’s fingers tightened around the camera. “What is it?”

She told him. The translation, the prayer, the Chronophage. The way it was following her, feeding on her past, her identity. The way it was learning, adapting, finding a way inside.
When she finished, Daniel was silent for a long moment. Then he said, “What do you need from me?”

She looked at him, really looked at him, for the first time in years. He was more than a friend. He was a witness. A anchor. A lifeline. “I need you to help me stop it.”

He nodded. “Okay. How?”

She stood up, her movements deliberate, her mind racing. “First, we need to understand it. To map it. To find its pattern. And then, we need to find a way to reverse it.”

Daniel stood up as well, his expression determined. “Alright. Let’s start with the photographs. We’ll take a series, document the changes. See if we can find a pattern.”

She nodded. “Good. And we need to find the original translation. The one I made. Before it was eaten. Before the gaps started.”

Daniel’s eyes widened. “You think it’s still out there?”

She nodded. “I think it is. And I think it’s the only thing that can stop this.”

Daniel picked up his camera. “Then let’s go.”

They left the apartment, the night air cool on their skin. The city was quiet, the streets empty, the buildings dark. It was a world that was still there, even if the reasons for it were gone.
They walked to the lab, the silence between them heavy, the weight of the unknown pressing down on them. The lab was dark, the doors locked. Elara pulled out her keys, her hands steady, her mind focused. She unlocked the door, the sound of the lock clicking open echoing in the quiet.
They stepped inside. The lab wa merely st as they had left it, the translation still on the table, the symbols still glowing faintly in the dark. Elara strode over to it, her steps slow, her eyes fixed on the symbols. She reached out, her fingers hovering over the paper.
Then she stopped. Something was wrong. The symbols were different. They had changed. The translation was no longer complete. It was no longer a key. It was a wound.
She glanced at Daniel, her eyes wide, her voice a whisper. “It’s too late. It’s already inside.”

The symbols on the paper glow brighter, the light pulsing, the rhythm slow, steady, inevitable. The Chronophage was awake. And it was hungry.
Daniel grabbed her arm, his grip tight, his voice urgent. “We need to go. Now.”

She nodded, her mind racing, her heart pounding. They turned to leave, the door just a few steps away. But the door was no longer there. The wall was smooth, unbroken, the door a memory that had been eaten.
They were trapped.
The light from the symbols grew brighter, the air thick with the smell of ozone, the sound of the pulse filling the room. The Chronophage was feeding. And it was coming for them.
Elara looked at Daniel, her eyes wide, her voice a whisper. “We need to fight it. We need to find a way to stop it.”

Daniel nodded, his expression determined. “We will. But first, we need to survive.”

The light from the symbols grew brighter, the air thick with the smell of ozone, the
