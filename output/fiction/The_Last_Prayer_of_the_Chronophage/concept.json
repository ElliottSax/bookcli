  "title": "The Last Prayer of the Chronophage",
  "genre": "horror",
  "subgenre": "cosmic",
  "premise": "A linguist specializing in dead languages is hired to translate a series of clay tablets unearthed from a newly-discovered layer of the Earth's crust, predating all known life. She succeeds, only to realize the text is not a historical record, but an active, recursive prayer\u2014and her translation was the final syllable required for its completion. Now, an entity that consumes not matter, but the very fabric of causality and time, begins to unspool reality from the edges of human memory inward.",
  "protagonist": "Dr. Elara Vance, a brilliant but disillusioned linguist haunted by the recent loss of her daughter.",
  "conflict": "Elara must find a way to 'un-say' the prayer and re-seal the Chronophage, while battling its psychological erosion of time and memory, which makes trust, history, and even her own past trauma terrifyingly malleable.",
  "setting": "Near-future, shifting between a high-security archaeological research facility in the Norwegian permafrost and the increasingly unstable and non-linear streets of London.",
  "tone": "A creeping, existential dread punctuated by moments of profound temporal dislocation and cosmic awe, where the horror lies in the unraveling of sequence and consequence itself."
