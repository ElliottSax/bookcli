    "chapter_01.md: SCORE: 7/10 | ISSUES: Non-fiction tone, dense exposition, no narrative hook\n\n**Writing Quality:** 8/10. Clear, authoritative, and technically proficient.\n**Dialogue Naturalness:** N/A. No dialogue present.\n**Pacing:** 5/10. Slow and academic; reads like a textbook introduction, not a fiction chapter.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n1. **Non-Fiction Tone:** The excerpt is purely expository, lacking any narrative elements, characters, or plot.\n2. **Info-Dump:** It presents a dense lecture on cognitive science without integrating the information into a story.\n3. **No Narrative Hook:** There is no scene, conflict, or character to engage a fiction reader's interest.",

Slow and didactic; the explanatory prose dominates without narrative thrust.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n1. **Repetitive Structure:** The chapter title appears twice consecutively, and the opening paragraph extensively rehashes Chapter 5.\n2. **Expository Density:** Reads like a nonfiction article or textbook, lacking narrative scene, character, or plot progression.\n3. **Editing Error:** The excerpt ends mid-sentence (\"According to Dr. Ja\"), indicating an incomplete copy.",

Clear, authoritative, and well-structured prose.\n2. **Dialogue Naturalness:** N/A. No dialogue present in the excerpt.\n3. **Pacing:** 6/10. The pacing is slow and didactic, resembling a textbook more than narrative fiction.\n4. **Specific Issues:**\n    *   **Genre Mismatch:** The excerpt reads like popular science or self-help, lacking narrative elements (character, scene, plot) expected in fiction.\n    *   **Info-Dump:** It is a block of pure exposition, explaining concepts rather than showing them through story.\n    *   **Technical Error:** The final sentence is cut off mid-thought (\"into a single, cohere\")."
