    "Chapter 1 references a 2019 meta-analysis, while Chapter 6 references a 2021 meta-analysis. If this is a single book written at one time, the timeline for citing recent studies is inconsistent unless the book's publication is explicitly after 2021.",
    "Chapter 6 references 'Chapter 5' as having introduced 'desirable difficulty,' but no excerpt from Chapter 5 is provided to verify consistency. This could be a missing context issue for the analysis, but within the provided text, there is an unresolved reference to prior content that the reader is expected to know.",
    "The final chapter excerpt references a 2017 study, which fits a plausible timeline, but the narrative jumps from discussing feedback (Ch6) to automation (Ch10) without resolution of the feedback loop's application. The plot thread of 'how to calibrate feedback' introduced in Ch6 is not resolved in the provided excerpts.",
    "Character names are not present in these excerpts (they appear to be from a non-fiction science/self-help book), so no character inconsistency is found. The 'characters' are the reader and generic researchers.",
    "Setting details are consistent (the setting is conceptual, focusing on cognitive science research and learning environments)."
