  "narrative_voice": "Second-person ('you'), instructional yet immersive. Blends explanatory prose (demystifying science), direct instruction (providing protocols), and motivational coaching. Uses extended metaphors (brain as landscape, city, circuit board, software) and concrete case studies like Michael's to ground concepts.",
  "tone": "Empowering, clinical-optimistic, urgent yet practical. Tone is confident and forward-looking, treating brain change as an inevitable, manageable process rather than a mystical one. Ends on a note of excited possibility and agency.",
  "plot_summary": "The book opens with a narrative hook (Michael's story) that introduces the core concept of neuroplasticity through a poignant, human lens. It then shifts to directly address the reader, arguing that the same plastic principles that healed a child's brain can be harnessed for career transformation. The central 'plot' is the reader's own journey from unconscious reactivity to conscious neurostrategist. This is structured as a series of frameworks and protocols: learning to identify and interrupt counterproductive neural 'loops,' designing and practicing new cognitive-behavioral 'circuits,' sourcing quarterly challenges, and conducting annual identity reviews. The narrative arc moves from discovery (your brain can change) to diagnosis (what's your current wiring?) to design (what do you want to build?) to deployment (using your work as a living lab). It concludes by fully transferring the role of experimenter and architect to the reader, leaving them with the provocative, open-ended question: 'What will you strategize next?'"
