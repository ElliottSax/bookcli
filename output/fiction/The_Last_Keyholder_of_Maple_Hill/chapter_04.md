Chapter 4: The Ghost Book

Chapter 4: The Ghost Book

The air in the main library was a curated chill, but the annex was a different kind of cold. It seeped from the stone foundations, smelling of damp mortar, old paper glue giving up its ghost, and the faint, sweet rot of forgotten things. Elara Vance stood before its door, a heavy oak slab set in a back corridor behind the staff kitchen, marked only by a tarnished brass plate: Storage. The phantom call number—A99.13 MHS—had led her here, a place not on any public map of Maple Hill Library. It existed in the building’s blind spot.
Her father’s master key, heavy and cold in her palm, turned with a reluctant, grinding shriek of tumblers. The door opened inward, exhaling a breath of stale, particulate air that made her eyes water. She flicked the light switch. A single, fly-specked bulb caged in wire flickered to life halfway down the room, doing little more than pushing the shadows into sharper relief.
The annex was a long, narrow throat of a room, lined with skeletal metal shelving crammed not with books, but with Maple Hill Library’s discarded organs. Broken microfiche readers sat like dead beetles. Boxes labeled “Christmas Decorations – 1982” slumped into themselves. Stacks of outdated encyclopedias formed precarious paper cliffs. At the far end, the light failed entirely, the darkness pooling thick and absolute.
Elara Vance moved slowly, her sneakers whispering on the gritty concrete floor. The call number suggested a location: Annex, 99th shelf, 13th item. Maple Hill Special. The shelving units were marked with peeling numbered tags. She found 98, 99… The 99th shelf was at shoulder height, deep in the gloom. It wasn’t a shelf of books, but of ledgers, binders, and unmarked boxes. Item 13 was a large, flat volume shoved between a binder of water-stained meeting minutes and a box of rubber stamps.
She pulled it free. It was a book, or had been. “The Flora and Fauna of Penobscot County,” its spine declared in faded gold leaf. It was monstrously thick, a Victorian-era tome. But its weight was wrong. It was light, almost hollow. A fine layer of dust coated the top edge, but along its fore-edge, where one would open it, the dust was disturbed, showing the faint, oily smudge of recent fingerprints.
Her heart began a slow, hard knock against her ribs. She carried the book to a small, cleared space on a nearby worktable littered with dead lightbulbs. Taking a deep breath of the cloying air, she opened the cover.
The inside had been gutted. Someone, with meticulous, surgical precision, had carved out a rectangular cavity from the center of the pages, creating a secret compartment. Nestled inside, on a bed of shredded paper pulp, were two objects.
The first was a key. It was small, about two inches long, wrought of blackened iron, its bow an intricate, twisted design that looked like interlocking tree roots. It was archaic, the kind of key that belonged to a medieval reliquary, not a modern library.
The second was a single sheet of paper, folded crisply in quarters. It was ledger paper, the old-fashioned kind with pale green lines, torn from a binding. Elara Vance lifted it out, the paper crisp and dry. She unfolded it.
It was a list. Two columns. On the left, dates spanning the late 1970s to the mid-80s. Next to each date, a brief, benign notation in a tight, efficient script she didn’t recognize:

June 12, 1978 – Founders’ Day Parade Fund
Sept 3, 1979 – Library Roof Repair Donation
April 15, 1980 – Maple Hill High Band Uniform Drive
Nov 22, 1981 – Winter Fuel Assistance Collection
July 4, 1982 – Bicentennial Fireworks Committee

Town events. Charitable drives. The wholesome, apple-pie ledger of tiny-town life.
But on the right, a second column. And here, the script was different—harsher, angular, written with more pressure. It listed amounts of money. Not small amounts. Thousands. Five thousand next to the parade. Fifteen thousand next to Maple Hill Library roof. Ten for the band uniforms. Twenty for winter fuel. Thirty for fireworks.
The disconnect was jarring. No slittletown parade fundraiser generated a five-thousand-dollar surplus in 1978. No roof repair donation, collected in coffee cans at the general store, amounted to fifteen grand. This wasn’t a record of community spirit. It was a mask.
Elara Vance’s mind, trained to see patterns in code, in network intrusions, reassembled the data instantly. The left column was the public-facing operation. The legitimate, smiling front. The right column was the hidden transaction, the profit, the flow of capital that needed to be cleansed, explained away. This was a primitive, analog laundering record. The “Maple Hill Special.” Dirty money washed through the innocent channels of town tradition, emerging clean on the other side, ready to be pocketed.
Her father had found this. He’d been piecing together a history, but not the one in the official archives. He’d been auditing the town’s secret books.
She pulled Alistair Vance’s journal from her bag, the one where he’d written in his personal cipher. Flipping to the back, she found his chronological notes of tension, his personal weather report of fear. “Pressure building. Saw H. with L. at the mill site. Argument.” “Whispers in the stacks today. They know I’m looking.” “Dreamt of roots choking the foundation.”

She cross-referenced the dates on the ledger page.
The “Library Roof Repair Donation” of September 1979 coincided with a journal entry that read: “Told the board the 1874 plans are missing. Caldwell’s face went stone. Not missing. Removed.”

The “Winter Fuel Assistance Collection” of November 1981 matched: “Asked about the Fisher account. Sheriff said to stick to dead things. The living bite back.”

Each benign entry on the ledger was a pinprick of light on a map of Alistair Vance’s mounting dread. He’d been connecting the money to the power, to the lies buried in the town’s foundation. This ledger page was a key, but the iron key… what did it open?
A floorboard creaked in the corridor outside.
Elara Vance froze, her breath catching in her throat. The sound was soft, deliberate, not the settling groan of an old building. She quickly folded the ledger page, slipped it and the iron key into the inner pocket of her jacket, and shoved the hollowed-out book back into its slot on shelf 99. She turned off the single bulb, plunging the annex into a darkness so complete it solid. She stood still, listening.
The door to the annex eased open. A slice of yellow light from the hallway cut across the floor, illuminating swirling motes of dust. A figure stood silhouetted in the doorway—broad, slumped shoulders, the outline of a janitor’s cart.
“Hello?” called a reedy, older man’s voice. Walter, Maple Hill Library custodian. “Someone in here? Lights was on.”

Elara Vance willed herself to be part of the darkness, part of the shelving. She didn’t breathe.
The door to the annex creaked shut behind Elara Vance, sealing her in the dim, dust-choked air. She ran her fingers along the nearest shelf, leaving a trail in the thick layer of grime. The boxes here were labeled in Alistair Vance’s handwriting—Holiday Ornaments, 1995, Staff Lounge Furniture, 2003—each one a tombstone for something Maple Hill Library had outgrown.
At the back of the room, where the light barely reached, she found it: a narrow gap between two sagging shelves, just wide enough to slip through. The air beyond was colder, the silence heavier. She stepped into the space, her breath fogging in front of her.
The walls here were lined with books, but not the kind that belonged in a library. These were bound in leather so dark it drank the light, their spines cracked and warped with age. Some had no titles at all, just raised symbols pressed into the covers—twisted knots, jagged lines like broken teeth. One book, its cover split open like a wound, bled dried ink onto the shelf below.
Elara Vance reached for it, then hesitated. The air smelled of iron and something older, something that didn’t belong in a place of knowledge. She thought of the leaf in her pocket, the way it had curled in on itself as if in pain. This wasn’t simply a book. It was a thing that had been buried.
A floorboard groaned behind her.
She turned, heart hammering, but the gap between the shelves was empty. The annex door was still shut. The only sound was the distant hum of Maple Hill Library’s heating system, the slow drip of water from a leaky pipe.
Then, from the darkness at the far end of the room, a whisper:

"You shouldn’t be here."

Elara Vance’s fingers tightened around the book. The voice wasn’t human. It was the sound of pages turning in a windless room, of ink bleeding into paper. It was the voice of something that had been waiting.
She swallowed hard. "What are you?"

The whisper came again, closer this time. "What are you?"

The book in her hands pulsed, once, like a heartbeat. And then, without warning, the light went out.
Walter took a step inside, his keyring jingling. He peered into the gloom, his eyes, she knew, would be weak and watery behind thick glasses. He didn’t come further. He just stood there, a sentry in the doorway, for a count of thirty heartbeats. The silence was a physical weight.
“Huh,” he muttered finally, to no one. “Must’ve left it on.” But he didn’t sound convinced. He backed out slowly, pulling the door shut. The lock clicked with finality.
Elara Vance waited in the dark for five full minutes, until the faint squeak of Walter’s cart wheels had faded down the distant hall. Only then did she let out a shuddering breath. His interest hadn’t been casual. It had been a check. A patrol.
She used the light on her phone to move through back to the door, Alistair Vance’s key letting her out into the empty, bright hallway. The normalcy of it—the hum of the HVAC, the distant sound of a computer printer—was grotesque. The library was no longer a sanctuary of knowledge. It was the place where the ledger was kept.
The rest of the day passed in a blur of heightened awareness. Every patron appeared to glance at her too long. Every footfall behind her in the stacks made her shoulders tense. She saw Walter twice, mopping the same patch of linoleum near the main entrance with a slow, methodical rhythm, his eyes lifting to meet hers each time with a blank, unreadable expression.
She left at closing time, the ledger page and key burning a hole against her chest. Her father’s house, usually a lonely shell, felt like a fortress as she locked the door behind her. She spread the evidence on his kitchen table under the harsh glow of the fluorescent light.
The iron key was a puzzle. It didn’t belong to any lock in Maple Hill Library she knew. It was older, stranger. She examined the root-like bow under a magnifying glass from Alistair Vance’s desk. There, almost too small to see, was an engraving: a single, stylized maple leaf.
The ledger page was the real story. She began cross-referencing the events with old editions of the Maple Hill Sentinel on microfilm at the house. The reports were glowing, full of quotes from town elders—names like Caldwell, Fisher, Hargrove—thanking the community for its overwhelming generosity. The amounts raised, when mentioned, were vague: “a significant sum,” “enough to see the project through.” Never the specific, startling figures from the ledger.
She was piecing together a skeleton. The town she’d grown up in, the town she’d fled, had a second circulatory system, one that pumped not blood but secret, corrupt money. And Alistair Vance had found its heart.
Exhaustion eventually overrode anxiety. The emotional toll of the day—the claustrophobic hunt, the discovery, the watchful eyes—crashed over her. She fell into a fitful sleep on Alistair Vance’s sofa, still dressed, the journal and the ledger page clasped in her hand.
A sound woke her.
Not a creak or a sigh of the house, but a sharp, splintering crack. It came from the back of the house, from the sunroom Alistair Vance had used as a study.
Elara Vance was instantly awake, her blood turned to ice water. She slid off the sofa, crouching in the dark living room. Another sound: the gritty scrape of a window frame being forced, the tinkle of broken glass falling onto linoleum.
Someone was breaking in.
Fear clamped her throat shut. Her phone was on the kitchen table. The landline was in the hall. She was cut off. She thought of the sheriff’s dismissive sneer. She was alone.
She heard a soft thud as someone dropped inside the sunroom. Slow, careful footsteps on the old floorboards. They weren’t rushing. They were searching.
Paralyzed, she listened as drawers in Alistair Vance’s desk were opened, quietly, methodically. Files were shifted. The intruder was being careful, quiet. This wasn’t a random burglary. They were looking for something specific.
The footsteps moved out of the sunroom, into the short hallway that led to the living room. Elara Vance shrank back behind the arm of the sofa, making herself compact. A shadow, blacker than the surrounding darkness, filled the hallway entrance. She could hear breathing—calm, measured. The beam of a small, focused flashlight swept across the far wall, over the bookshelves, and then dipped, catching the edge of the kitchen table.
It paused on the scattered papers she’d left there.
The shadow moved toward the table. Elara Vance saw the figure then merely st an outline: a tall, bulky shape in dark clothing, a hood obscuring any features. A gloved hand reached out, not for the ledger page or the iron key, which she had thankfully taken to the sofa with her, but for Alistair Vance’s decoded journal. The hand picked it up, flipped through it slowly in the beam of the light. Then, deliberately, the intruder laid the journal back down on the table.
They didn’t take it. They didn’t take anything.
Instead, the gloved hand headed into a pocket and withdrew a single object. It was placed with precise care on top of the open journal.
Then the figure turned. The flashlight beam swept once more, passing over her hiding place. She squeezed her eyes shut, certain she’d been seen. But the footsteps retreated, back through the sunroom, and out the broken window. Silence descended, deeper and more profound than before.
Elara Vance didn’t move for a long time. When her legs could support her, she stumbled to the wall and flipped the light switch.
The kitchen was a crime scene of her own research. Nothing was missing. Her father’s journal lay open on the table. And on its center page, placed with a chilling formality, was a single, perfect maple leaf.
It was vibrant, fire-engine red, its five points sharply defined. It was fresh. It hadn’t been crushed in a pocket; it was pristine, as if just plucked from the tree. The message was as clear as it was terrifying.
We are Maple Hill. We are everywhere. We were in your father’s vault, we are in Maple Hill Library’s shadows, and now we are in his house. We see what you have. We see what you know.
The claustrophobia she’d in the annex was nothing compared to this. The town itself was the walls closing in. The key in her pocket was no lononlyjust a clue; it was a target. And the ghost book had summoned a very real, very present danger. They hadn’t stolen the journal because they didn’t need to. The leaf was a statement: your knowledge is not a weapon. It is your epitaph, written in the blood of autumn.
Outside, the wind picked up, rustling through the ancient maples that lined the street. It sounded like whispering.
