 t all down. The money, the lies, the rot. But the method… that was something else. That was the work of someone who knew Maple Hill Library like the back of their hand. Someone who could move through its shadows without a sound.

She pushed off the wall, her boots scuffing against the worn carpet. The hallway stretched ahead, dark and endless. She needed to think. To breathe. To not be here, in this place that had swallowed Alistair Vance whole.

But she couldn’t leave. Not yet.

She turned back toward the archive, her steps slow, deliberate. The light from her desk lamp was a light in the dark, a fragile thing against the weight of what she now knew. She sat down, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. The phantom ledger entries glowed on the screen, a silent accusation.

She had the proof. Now, she needed a plan.

The clock on her computer read 1:17 AM. The library was a tomb, but it was her tomb now, too. She was the Keyholder. And she was going to open the vault.

But first, she needed to find the key.

The key to the vault was the key to everything. And it was somewhere in this labyrinth, waiting for her to find it.

She stood up, her chair creaking under her. The archive was a maze, a puzzle box of shelves and shadows. She walked to the nearest one, running her fingers along the spines of the books. They were old, their leather covers cracked with age. The scent of paper and dust filled her air, a familiar comfort in the midst of chaos.

She pulled out a book at random, flipping through its pages. The words were a blur, meaningless in her current state. She put it back, her fingers brushing against something cold and metallic. She pulled it out, her heart pounding.

It was a key.

She held it up to the light, her breath catching in her throat. It was old, tarnished with age, but the teeth were still sharp, still ready to turn in a lock. She turned it over in her hands, feeling the weight of it. The key to the vault.

But how had it gotten here? Who had put it here?

She looked around the archive, her eyes scanning the shelves. The key had been hidden, but not well. It was as if someone had wanted it to be found. But by whom?

She thought of Alistair Vance, of his last days. He had been searching for something, something that would bring down the Covenant. He had been close, so close. And then, he had been silenced.

She looked back at the key in her hand. It was the key to the vault, but it was also the key to the truth. And she was going to use it.

She walked back to her desk, her steps quick and sure. She set the key down on the blueprint, its teeth gleaming in the lamplight. She looked at the schematics, her mind racing. The vault door was massive, but it was also old. It had been built for a different time, a time when locks were simpler, when keys were easier to duplicate.

She picked up the key, feeling its weight in her hand. She had the key. She had the proof. She had the motive. Now, all she needed was the courage to open the vault.

She looked at the clock. 1:30 AM. The library was silent, the night outside dark and endless. She was alone, but she was not afraid.

She was the Keyholder. And she was going to open the vault.

She stood up, her chair scraping against the floor. She walked to the vault door, her steps echoing in the empty hallway. She inserted the key into the lock, feeling the teeth catch. She turned it, the mechanism groaning in protest.

The door swung open, exhaling a wave of cold, preserved air. She stepped inside, her heart pounding in her chest. The light was a single, bare bulb in its wire cage. The proof was there, waiting for her.

She walked to the pedestal, her eyes scanning the empty space. The First Edition was gone, but the truth was still here. The truth was in the walls, in the air, in the very bones of Maple Hill Library.

She looked around, her eyes taking in every detail. The vault was a tomb, but it was also a witness. It had seen everything. It had heard everything. And now, it was going to tell her the truth.

She walked to the wall, her fingers brushing against the cold stone. She felt the grooves, the carvings, the secrets hidden in the stone. She traced them with her fingers, feeling the weight of the past.

She closed her eyes, her mind racing. The truth was here. It was in the walls, in the air, in the very bones of Maple Hill Library. And she was going to find it.

She opened her eyes, her gaze falling on the floor. There, in the dust, was a single footprint. Fresh. Recent.

She looked up, her heart pounding. She was not alone.

She turned, her eyes scanning the shadows. The vault was dark, the light from the single bulb casting long, eerie shadows. She could feel the presence, the weight of another person in the room.

She took a step back, her hand reaching for the key in her pocket. She was not afraid. She was the Keyholder. And she was going to open the vault.

She turned, her eyes meeting the gaze of the figure in the shadows. It was a face she recognized, a face she trusted.

But it was also the face of a killer.

She took a step back, her heart pounding in her chest. She was not afraid. She was the Keyholder. And she was going to open the vault.

She reached for the key, her fingers brushing against the cold metal. She turned it, the mechanism groaning in protest.
