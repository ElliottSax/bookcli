Chapter 5: The Covenant's Keepers

The rain had settled into a persistent, whispering drizzle by the time Elara reached the edge of the old town. Leo Vance lived in a converted carriage house behind the grand, sagging Victorian that had once belonged to his family. The main house was a dark silhouette against the bruised sky, but light bled warmly from the carriage house’s leaded glass windows, a beacon in the gloom.

She knocked, the sound swallowed by the wet velvet of the night. The door opened, not with a jerk of surprise, but with a slow, deliberate swing, as if she’d been expected. Leo stood there, a man in his late sixties with a scholar’s stoop and eyes the colour of tarnished silver behind wire-rimmed glasses. He wore a cardigan patched at the elbows over a flannel shirt, and the scent of pipe tobacco, old paper, and lemon wood polish rolled out to meet her.

“Elara,” he said, his voice a soft, gravelly thing. No question. Just her name, weighted with a sadness that felt decades deep. “Come in. I’ve just put the kettle on.”

His home was a single, glorious room—a historian’s cave. Bookshelves climbed every wall, interrupted only by a small kitchenette, a stone fireplace where logs crackled, and a chaotic desk under a green-shaded lamp. Maps of Maple Hill from different centuries were pinned in overlapping layers. Photographs of stern-faced men and women in period dress watched from frames. The air was close, warm, and thick with the smell of knowledge and dust.

“He said you’d come,” Leo said, moving to the stove. “Someday. After.”

Elara stood dripping on the braided rug. “My father?”

“Who else?” He didn’t turn. “He said, ‘If anything happens to me, Leo, she’ll start digging. She won’t be able to help it. When she does, you tell her. Tell her everything.’ I argued with him. Told him he was being melodramatic.” Leo’s shoulders slumped. “I was wrong.”

The simple admission broke the last of Elara’s reserve. The fear, the confusion, the crushing weight of the silent library and the violated vault came rushing up. She pressed a hand to her mouth, stifling a sob that was part grief, part sheer relief at not being alone.

Leo brought over a tray with a chipped teapot and two mismatched cups. He guided her to a worn leather armchair by the fire, taking the one opposite. For a long moment, they sat in silence, listening to the hiss of the rain on the roof and the pop of the fire.

“He was afraid, Leo,” Elara finally said, her voice raw. “Not just preoccupied. Truly afraid. Someone broke into the library vault last night. They went through his things.”

Leo’s cup paused halfway to his lips. A slow blink. “What did they take?”

“I don’t know. But they left something. A page from an old ledger, tucked into one of his coded journals. It was a list of names, payments. Dates going back to the 1920s, but… the last entry was from this year.”

Leo set his cup down carefully, the china clicking like a falling stone. “Show me.”

She pulled the plastic-sleeved page from her bag. He took it, adjusting his glasses. His eyes scanned the spidery script, and a profound weariness settled over his features. “Oh, Alistair,” he breathed. “You found the ledger. I told you to leave it buried.”

“What is it?”

“Proof,” Leo said, laying the page on the low table between them as if it were contaminated. “The Maple Hill Covenant wasn’t just a quaint historical footnote, Elara. It was a blood-and-soil agreement. 1847. Four families: the Vances, the Blackwoods, the Hargraves, and the Thorne family. They carved up the valley—the timber, the water rights, the fertile land, the routes for the coming railroad. They agreed to control it in perpetuity, to keep outsiders out, and to resolve any disputes amongst themselves, privately. No courts, no outsiders. A secret government.”

“That’s… feudal,” Elara whispered.

“It’s practical, from their view. And it worked. It built the town you see. The library, the town hall, the park—all gifts from the ‘Founding Families.’ But gifts have strings.” He pointed a bony finger at the ledger page. “This is the ‘Equilibrium.’ A fund. Each family contributed, originally to buy out any member who wanted to leave, or to smooth over… inconveniences. A farmer whose well was mysteriously poisoned after refusing to sell. A shopkeeper who saw something he shouldn’t. Over time, it became a slush fund for maintaining their influence. Paying off officials, financing friendly candidates, burying lawsuits.”

Elara stared at the names. Regular payments from each family, recorded with chilling neatness. “This goes on for a century. It can’t still be active.”

Leo gave a dry, humourless laugh. “Why do you think the new highway bypassed Maple Hill? Why the big chain stores never get approval for land here? Why the sheriff is a Hargrave and the mayor married a Blackwood? The Covenant adapted. It got quieter, smoother. More modern. It’s not about stealing land anymore; it’s about controlling the zoning board, the historical society, the bank. The narrative.”

He leaned forward, the firelight carving deep shadows in his face. “Your father, Elara, was the last Keyholder. It was a hereditary role for the Thorne family, passed down to the eldest. The ‘Keyholder’ was not just the librarian. He was the keeper of the Covenant’s physical records, the facilitator of their private meetings, the neutral party. The vault wasn’t just for rare books. The inner room, the one with the round table…”

“The one that’s always locked separately,” Elara finished, a chill crawling up her spine.

“That was their boardroom. For over 150 years, every major decision affecting Maple Hill was made in that room. Your father held the only key to that inner door. He was the last because the Thorne line ended with him. And with you, who left.”

The words hung in the tobacco-scented air. Who left. Her flight, her self-imposed exile, now felt like a tectonic shift she hadn’t understood. She had broken the chain.

“He hated it,” Leo continued, his voice softening. “He was a man of light and knowledge, forced to be the guardian of secrets and backroom deals. But he believed, foolishly perhaps, that he could be a moderating influence from within. Then, a few months ago, he found this.” He tapped the ledger page. “The original Covenant ledger was supposed to have been destroyed in the ‘50s, when they went ‘modern.’ But a partial copy survived. Your father discovered entries that didn’t match the official, sanitized history. He started cross-referencing. He found that the ‘Equilibrium’ wasn’t just for town business anymore. Large, irregular withdrawals. No explanations. He believed one of the families—or someone within the Covenant—was using the old fund for private blackmail. Skimming. Or worse.”

“The scratched-out face in the portrait,” Elara said. “The fourth founding family. Thorne. They erased us.”

“Not them,” Leo corrected gently. “Him. The current head of the family that did it. A sign of contempt, or a warning. Your father’s investigation was getting too close to someone’s personal empire. He told me he’d confronted them, generally, at a meeting. Said the Covenant was being corrupted. That he would not be complicit.” Leo took off his glasses, polishing them slowly. “They laughed at him, Elara. Told him his role was custodial, not judicial. Then the ‘accidents’ started. A near-miss with a falling slate from the library roof. Faulty wiring in his desk lamp that gave him a nasty shock. He started to see cars parked down the street from his house, just sitting in the dark.”

The claustrophobia of the town tightened around Elara’s throat. The friendly faces at the diner, the respectful nods on the street—how many were just playing a part? The whole of Maple Hill felt like a beautifully furnished room with a rotten floor.

“Why didn’t he go to the police?”

“The sheriff’s cousin is married to a Blackwood. The deputy is a Vance. The police are the Covenant, in many ways. Your father’s only protection was his role, his knowledge, and the fact that making him disappear would raise too many questions. But he was a man living on borrowed time in a gilded cage. And now… someone has opened the door to that cage.”
