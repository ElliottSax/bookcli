Chapter 3: The First Cipher

A different kind of cold lived in the archival stacks. Not the crisp chill of a Maple Hill autumn, nor the damp, earthy scent of spring, not even the musty smell of old books. This was a stagnant, granular cold that clung to the skin like a damp shroud. From the row’s end, the single caged bulb Elara Vance had switched on cast a jaundiced light, pushing shadows deeper into the canyon of metal shelves rather than dispelling them. Each shelf groaned under ledgers, tax records, town meeting minutes from centuries when the town had a different name and darker secrets. Silence thickened the air, a muffling presence broken only by the scuff of her boots on linoleum and the frantic drum of her own heart.
The key grew warm in her clenched fist, its intricate, non-functional filigree biting into her palm. Her father’s note, found tucked in his desk blotter, had been short and maddeningly typical: *For when the official record is not enough. Look to the 1897 land grants, third stack from the west wall, shelf at eye-level. The cabinet is behind the false ledger backs.*

An hour of searching found them. The ‘false ledger backs’ were three volumes of *Agricultural Yields of Hampden County, 1895-1899*, spines sun-bleached to a uniform pale brown and snug against the shelf’s back. Pulling one did nothing. Only when she pushed the entire block of three inward did a soft, reluctant click sound. A two-foot-wide section of the shelving unit swung inward an inch, revealing a dark, narrow seam.
Standing before it, a wave of claustrophobia hit, making her vision swim. The stacks pressed in from all sides, the ceiling a low grid of pipes and wires just overhead. This was Alistair Vance’s world: a labyrinth of paper and silence, where she’d become a small, lost child searching for a way out. The air vibrated with the weight of his secrets, the whispers of his private thoughts. Her fingers found a small, tarnished brass keyhole hidden in the shadow of the shelf’s metal frame. The key turned with a smooth, well-oiled precision that tightened her shoulders. Silent hinges let the hidden door swing inward, revealing a shallow cabinet no more than a foot deep.
Inside were two things.
First, a photograph. A stiff, sepia-toned print mounted on cardstock declared *Maple Hill Founders’ Society, 1920* in elegant script. Four men stood formally on the steps of the original library, a granite building lost to fire in the ‘50s. Heavy suits and solemn expressions clothed three faces clear and familiar from other portraits around town: Alistair Vance, her own great-grandfather, stern and proud; Jeremiah Croft, founder of the lumber mill; and Dr. Arthur Bell, the first proper physician. The fourth man, standing slightly apart, had been carefully, violently scratched out. Not torn or burned, but erased with what looked like a razor or a very sharp blade, leaving only a jagged, white crater of ruined paper where a face should have been. The focused, personal damage twisted something in her gut.
A shiver traced her spine. This was a moment frozen in time, a snapshot of a town still young and full of promise. But something didn’t fit. The fourth man, the erased one, appeared to look directly at her, his absent gaze an accusation. Fear jolted through her, quickly smothered by a hard knot of determination. She had to know what happened to him.
The second item was a journal, a sturdy, unmarked notebook with a cover of faded green cloth. Lifting it out, the weight solemn in her hands. Her breath caught upon opening it. The pages brimmed with Alistair Vance’s precise, angular handwriting, but it was gibberish—a chaotic blend of Latin phrases, strings of numbers resembling Dewey Decimal classifications, and odd, truncated symbols. Margins held sketches: a twisted tree, a series of interlocking squares, a rudimentary map of the town square with strange, tiny annotations. A code. Of course. Silas Vance didn’t have private thoughts; he had encrypted data.
Beneath the journal lay a single sheet of loose paper. On it, in the same coded script, was a list:

Walden – Thoreau
The Silmarillion – Tolkien
The Interpretation of Dreams – Freud
The Book of the Dead – various
The Anatomy of Melancholy – Burton

It read like a random sampling from a pretentious undergraduate’s reading list. But nothing Alistair Vance did was random. Tucking the photograph into the journal, she gathered everything into her arms and retreated from the suffocating closeness of the stacks, the hidden door clicking shut behind her.
Back in the basement office, under the relentless glare of the green-shaded desk lamp, the real work began. Warmer air here carried the smell of stale coffee and Alistair Vance’s particular scent of pipe tobacco and paper glue, but it proved no less oppressive. The towers of fileto lean in, watching. Spreading the journal open beside her humming laptop, she started with the Latin, isolating the recurring phrases: “Quod est inferius est sicut quod est superius.” (As above, so below.) “Custos veritatis.” (Keeper of the truth.) “Fidei defensor.” (Defender of the faith.) Grandiose, theatrical words—nothing like his usual dry, academic tone.
The numbers were trickier. 974.42. 133.4. 001.942. Dewey numbers, but illogical. 974.42 covered Hampden County history. 133.4 meant Apparitions. 001.942… she looked it up… “Controversial knowledge in the paranormal.” She cross-referenced them with the Latin., looking for a pattern, a key. Her eyes burned. The clock on the wall, a silent sentinel, ticked past midnight.
It was the symbols that broke it open. One of them, a tiny circle with a line through it, was drawn next to the phrase “Clavis et clavis.” Key and key. It was a library symbol. The line through the circle meant “restricted” or “special collection.” Her mind, trained to see patterns in digital chaos, align the pieces. The numbers weren’t subjects; they were locations. The Latin provided context. The code was a cataloging system. A personal, paranoid cataloging system for a private collection of knowledge.
She began translating the first full entry, the one following the photograph’s discovery date. The words blurred together on the page, but as she worked, the meaninto emerge. It was a list of books, each one representing a different aspect of Alistair Vance’s research. Walden, the classic of American literature, was paired with The Silmarillion, the epic fantasy of Tolkien. The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud’s seminal work on the human psyche, was linked to The Book of the Dead, a collection of ancient myths and legends. The Anatomy of Melancholy, a classic of English literature, was paired with Burton’s The Book of the Dead, a collection of dark, mystical texts.
As she worked, the room seemed to arker, the shadows deepening and twisting around her. The air was thick with the scent of old books and dust, and Elara Vance like she was uncovering a secret that had been hidden for centuries. She was no longer just a daughter, searching for answers about Alistair Vance’s past. She was a detective, piecing together a puzzle that had been hidden in plain sight.
The clock on the wall ticked past 1 AM, the only sound in the room. Elara Vance’s eyes were fixed on the page, her mind racing with the implications of what she had discovered. She was no longer simply searching for Alistair Vance’s secrets. She was uncovering a hidden world, a world of knowledge and power that had been hidden for centuries.
As she worked, the shadows seeme longer, twisting and writhing around her like living things. The air was thick with anticipation, and Elara Vance like she was on the verge of something momentous. She was a key, unlocking a door to a hidden world, a world of secrets and mysteries that had been hidden for centuries.
As she worked, the clock on the wall ticked past 2 AM, the only sound in the room.
The clock on the wall ticked past 10 AM, the only sound in the room. She was no longer just searching
