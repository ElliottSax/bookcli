Chapter 3: The First Cipher

The air in the archival stacks was a different kind of cold. It wasn’t the crisp chill of a Maple Hill autumn; it wasn’t the damp, earthy scent of spring; it wasn’t even the musty smell of old books. It was a stagnant, granular cold that clung to the skin like a damp shroud. The single, caged bulb Elara Vance had switched on at the end of the row cast a jaundiced light that seemed to push the shadows deeper into the canyon of metal shelves, rather than dispel them. Each shelf groaned under the weight of ledgers, tax records, town meeting minutes from centuries when the town had a different name and darker secrets. The silence was a physical thing, thick and muffling, broken only by the scuff of her boots on the linoleum and the frantic drum of her own heart.

She held the key. It was warm from her clenched fist, the intricate, non-functional filigree on its bow biting into her palm. Her father’s note, found tucked in his desk blotter, was short and maddeningly typical of him: For when the official record is not enough. Look to the 1897 land grants, third stack from the west wall, shelf at eye-level. The cabinet is behind the false ledger backs.

It had taken her an hour to find it. The ‘false ledger backs’ were three volumes of Agricultural Yields of Hampden County, 1895-1899, their spines sun-bleached to a uniform pale brown. They were snug against the back of the shelf. When she’d tried to pull one, it hadn’t budged. It was only when she pushed the entire block of three inward that she heard the soft, reluctant click. A section of the shelving unit, about two feet wide, had swung inward an inch, revealing a dark, narrow seam.

Now, standing before it, Elara Vance felt a wave of claustrophobia so intense her vision swam. The stacks pressed in from all sides, the ceiling a low grid of pipes and wires just above her head. This was Alistair Vance’s world: a labyrinth of paper and silence. She felt like a small, lost child, searching for a way out of a maze. The air seemed to vibrate with the weight of Alistair Vance's secrets, the whispers of his private thoughts. She fitted the key into a small, tarnished brass keyhole she hadn’t noticed until now, hidden in the shadow of the shelf’s metal frame. It turned with a smooth, well-oiled precision that was unnerving. The hidden door swung inward on silent hinges, revealing a shallow cabinet no more than a foot deep.

Inside were two things.

The first was a photograph, a stiff, sepia-toned print mounted on cardstock. Maple Hill Founders’ Society, 1920, was written in elegant script at the bottom. Four men stood formally on the steps of the original library, a granite building that had burned down in the ‘50s. They wore heavy suits and solemn expressions. Three of the faces were clear, familiar from other portraits around town: Alistair Vance, her own great-grandfather, stern and proud; Jeremiah Croft, founder of the lumber mill; and Dr. Arthur Bell, the first proper physician. The fourth man, standing slightly apart from the others, had been meticulously, violently scratched out. Not torn, not burned, but erased with what looked like a razor or a very sharp blade, leaving only a jagged, white crater of ruined paper where a face should have been. The damage was focused, personal. It made her stomach turn.

She felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed at the photograph. It was a moment frozen in time, a snapshot of a moment when the town was still young and full of promise. But there was something else, something that didn’t quite fit. The fourth man, the one who had been erased, seemed to be looking directly at her, his eyes accusing. She felt a jolt of fear, but it was quickly replaced by a sense of determination. She had to know what had happened to him.

The second item was a journal. It was a sturdy, unmarked notebook with a cover of faded green cloth. She lifted it out, the weight of it solemn in her hands. Opening it, her breath caught. The pages were filled with Alistair Vance’s precise, angular handwriting, but it was gibberish. A chaotic blend of Latin phrases, strings of numbers that looked like Dewey Decimal classifications, and odd, truncated symbols. In the margins were sketches: a twisted tree, a series of interlocking squares, a rudimentary map of the town square with strange, tiny annotations. It was a code. Of course it was. Silas Vance didn’t have private thoughts; he had encrypted data.

Beneath the journal was a single sheet of loose paper. On it, in the same coded script, was a list:

Walden – Thoreau
The Silmarillion – Tolkien
The Interpretation of Dreams – Freud
The Book of the Dead – various
The Anatomy of Melancholy – Burton

It read like a random sampling from a pretentious undergraduate’s reading list. But nothing Alistair Vance did was random. She tucked the photograph into the journal, gathered everything into her arms, and retreated from the suffocating closeness of the stacks, the hidden door clicking shut behind her.

Back in the basement office, under the relentless glare of the green-shaded desk lamp, the real work began. The air here was warmer, tinged with the smell of stale coffee and Alistair Vance’s particular scent of pipe tobacco and paper glue, but it was no less oppressive. The towers of files seemed to lean in, watching. Elara Vance spread the journal open, her laptop humming beside her. She started with the Latin, isolating the recurring phrases: “Quod est inferius est sicut quod est superius.” (As above, so below.) “Custos veritatis.” (Keeper of the truth.) “Fidei defensor.” (Defender of the faith.) They were grandiose, theatrical. Not like Alistair Vance’s usual dry, academic tone.

The numbers were trickier. 974.42. 133.4. 001.942. They were Dewey numbers, but they didn’t correspond logically. 974.42 was Hampden County history. 133.4 was Apparitions. 001.942 was… she looked it up… “Controversial knowledge in the paranormal.” She cross-referenced them with the Latin, looking for a pattern, a key. Her eyes burned. The clock on the wall, a silent sentinel, ticked past midnight.

It was the symbols that broke it open. One of them, a small circle with a line through it, was drawn next to the phrase “Clavis et clavis.” Key and key. It was a library symbol. The line through the circle meant “restricted” or “special collection.” Her mind, trained to see patterns in digital chaos, began to align the pieces. The numbers weren’t subjects; they were locations. The Latin provided context. The code was a cataloging system. A personal, paranoid cataloging system for a private collection of knowledge.

She began translating the first full entry, the one following the photograph’s discovery date. The words blurred together on the page, but as she worked, the meaning began to emerge. It was a list of books, each one representing a different aspect of Alistair Vance’s research. Walden, the classic of American literature, was paired with The Silmarillion, the epic fantasy of Tolkien. The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud’s seminal work on the human psyche, was linked to The Book of the Dead, a collection of ancient myths and legends. The Anatomy of Melancholy, a classic of English literature, was paired with Burton’s The Book of the Dead, a collection of dark, mystical texts.

As she worked, the room seemed to grow darker, the shadows deepening and twisting around her. The air was thick with the scent of old books and dust, and Elara Vance felt like she was uncovering a secret that had been hidden for centuries. She was no longer just a daughter, searching for answers about Alistair Vance’s past. She was a detective, piecing together a puzzle that had been hidden in plain sight.

The clock on the wall ticked past 1 AM, the only sound in the room. Elara Vance’s eyes were fixed on the page, her mind racing with the implications of what she had discovered.
