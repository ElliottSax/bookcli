 side, as if it had fallen from above. Elara Vance’s pulse quickened. She reached out, then hesitated. Evidence. She needed to preserve this.

Her phone was in her pocket. She snapped a picture, then another, from different angles. The screw was small, but it was there. A single, glaring inconsistency in a room designed to be flawless.

She stood, her mind racing. Who would have access to this closet? Who would know the system well enough to exploit it? The head librarian, certainly. The maintenance staff. The town’s building inspector. The police. The mayor.

Her father’s killer.

She pocketed her phone and stepped back into the hall. The air felt different now, charged. The library was no longer a sanctuary; it was a stage set, every shadow a potential witness. She needed to move, to think, to act.

But first, she needed to understand.

Elara Vance returned to the reading room, her steps echoing in the empty space. The blueprints lay where she had left them, the weights holding them down like silent sentinels. She studied the purge system again, tracing the lines with her finger.

The system was designed to be foolproof. The toggle was behind glass. The panel was locked. But the lock was a simple keyhole, the kind that could be picked with a paperclip. And the key, she realized, was probably kept in the head librarian’s office.

She needed to see that office.

The head librarian, Mrs. Hargrove, was a woman of rigid routines. She arrived at 8:30 AM sharp, left at 4:30 PM. She took her lunch at her desk, a ritual that included a thermos of tea and a sandwich wrapped in wax paper. Elara Vance had timed her visits to Maple Hill Library to coincide with these lunches, slipping into the reading room when the coast was clear.

But today, she needed to be more direct.

She found Mrs. Hargrove in her office, a small, cluttered room filled with the scent of old books and lavender. The librarian looked up from her sandwich, her glasses perched on the edge of her nose.

“Elara Vance,” she said, her voice cool. “What can I do for you?”

Elara Vance forced a smile. “I was hoping to see the key to the maintenance closet. I’m doing some research on Maple Hill Library’s climate control system, and I think there might be some historical documents in there.”

Mrs. Hargrove’s eyes narrowed. “The maintenance closet? That’s not a public area, Elara Vance. It’s for staff use only.”

“I understand,” Elara Vance said, her voice steady. “But I think it’s important. My father was working on something related to the system, and I think it might be in there.”

Mrs. Hargrove hesitated, then sighed. “Very well. But you must be quick. I can’t have you wandering around back there.”

She reached into her desk drawer and pulled out a small, brass key. Elara Vance took it, her fingers brushing against the cold metal. The key was old, the teeth worn smooth with use.

“Thank you,” she said, slipping the key into her pocket. “I’ll be careful.”

As she left the office, she could feel Mrs. Hargrove’s eyes on her back. The key burned in her pocket, a promise of answers.

She made her way back to the maintenance closet, her heart pounding. The key fit smoothly into the lock, turning with a satisfying click. She stepped inside, the door closing behind her with a soft thud.

The room was just as she had left it, the screw still glinting on the floor. She knelt down, her fingers brushing against the cold metal. It was small, but it was there. A single, glaring inconsistency in a room designed to be flawless.

She needed to understand what it meant.

Elara Vance stood, her mind racing. The screw was a clue, a piece of the puzzle. But what did it signify? Who had left it here? And why?

She needed to find out.

She stepped back into the hall, the key still in her hand. The library felt different now, charged with a sense of urgency. She needed to move, to think, to act.
