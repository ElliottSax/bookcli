Chapter 12: The Last Bite

The scent of old yeast and older fear hung in the air of The Wild Loaf. Elara stood in the doorway, the bakery’s ruined heart stretching before her. Moonlight, thin and milky, filtered through the grime-caked windows, painting the dust-flourished workbenches and the gaping maw of the brick oven in shades of bone and ash. Her hunch had been a physical pull, a cord tied behind her navel, dragging her from the chaos of the sabotaged festival tent, past the blinking lights of the sheriff’s cruiser, and back here. To where it all began.

And there, in the pallid light, stood Maureen Crofton.

She wasn’t the brisk, flour-dusted pillar of the community. She was a silhouette of grief and rage, standing over the open mouth of the old proofing cabinet. In her hands, cradled like a relic, was the missing piece: Arthur Crofton’s original ceramic starter crock. The one Elara had seen in the photograph, the one that had vanished after his death.

“You found it,” Elara said, her voice barely disturbing the thick silence. “In the one place no one would look. His own bakery, boarded up and left for dead.”

Maureen didn’t startle. She turned slowly, her face a mask of weary resignation. The crock was a dark, squat shape in her hands. “It needed to be fed,” she said, as if explaining something simple to a child. “Even now. It’s… it’s still alive. He’d have hated it, going unfed.”

“You killed him,” Elara said. It wasn’t a question.

A long sigh escaped Maureen, a sound that seemed to deflate her entire frame. She set the crock gently on the workbench, her fingers lingering on its cool glaze. “He was going to tell everything. Not just about the boy, Peter. All of it. My father’s deal, the bribes, the lies. The great ‘rescue’ that made him mayor and made this town a prison of secrets.” She looked around the ruined bakery, her eyes glistening. “He said the guilt was rotting him from the inside out, worse than any sourdough hooch. He was going to write it all into that final recipe book. A confession baked into a bâtard.”

Elara took a careful step forward, the gritty texture of spilled flour and plaster crunching under her boots. The air was cold, carrying the ghost of a thousand loaves and this one, terrible truth. “So you argued. Here.”

“He was so calm,” Maureen whispered, her voice gaining a sharp, fractured edge. “He said it was time the town tasted its own history, no matter how bitter. I begged him. My father was dying, his legacy… my family’s name… this town… it would have crumbled to nothing. But Arthur just kept talking about transparency, about how a starter needs air to thrive, not to be sealed in the dark.” Her hand clenched into a fist on the bench. “He turned his back on me. Went to pull his precious starter from the fridge. And I saw the rolling pin. It was just… there.”

The image bloomed in Elara’s mind, vivid and horrifying: the heavy maple cylinder, a tool of creation, lifted in a moment of perfect, preserving fury. The thud would have been a soft, final punctuation in the dough-scented air.

“You staged the robbery. Took the cash box, the petty things. But you took the crock, too. Why?”

Maureen’s chin trembled. “Because it was his heart. The only thing he truly loved. I couldn’t leave it. And I couldn’t let anyone else have it.” She looked at Elara, truly looked at her, and the decades of practiced composure melted into a slurry of anguish. “You understand, don’t you? You came here chasing a taste. You know some things are too potent to let loose into the world.”

Elara felt a surge of cold anger. “I understand you murdered a man. You let an innocent woman—me—take the blame. You let a town fester in a lie for forty years.”

“The town thrived on that lie!” Maureen shot back, her voice echoing in the hollow space. “Jobs came. Money came. We were safe. My father gave them that. Arthur wanted to take it all away, for what? A boy who got a new life, a better life, because of us?”

The creak of a floorboard behind Elara was subtle, but Maureen’s eyes flickered to it, widening a fraction. Elara didn’t turn. She knew the sound of Leo’s careful tread, had heard it in his apartment above the bakery for weeks. He must have followed her, too.

“The boy, Peter, didn’t see it that way,” Elara said, holding Maureen’s gaze, keeping her distracted. “He lived a life built on a kidnapping. His mother died believing her son was dead. That’s the taste you’ve preserved, Maureen. It’s not heritage. It’s poison.”

“It was survival!” Maureen cried, her hand now gripping the crock so tightly her knuckles were white moons. “And you… you and your articles, your questions, digging up graves better left covered. You were just like him. A romantic fool believing truth was more important than peace.”

Another shadow detached itself from the deeper darkness near the storefront. Sheriff Lowell, his broad frame moving with a surprising quiet, stepped into the wedge of moonlight. His face was granite.

“Maureen Crofton,” he said, his voice a low rumble that seemed to shake the very dust motes in the air. “You need to put that down and come with me.”

Maureen flinched as if struck. She looked from the sheriff to Elara, to Leo now visible by the door, his face pale and set. The last vestige of fight left her. It didn’t dissolve into tears, but into a profound, crumbling exhaustion. She looked down at the crock.

“He named it Arthur, you know,” she said, her voice flat. “After himself. The ultimate vanity. A living monument.” She lifted it, not in threat, but in offering, towards Elara. “It’s hungry.”

Elara crossed the space and took the heavy crock. The ceramic was cold, but she imagined she could feel a faint, persistent warmth at its core, the slow, anaerobic breath of decades. She pried off the lid. The smell was profound—a deep, acidic, fruity tang, like apples and earth and time itself. The starter was healthy, a bubbly, beige-gray expanse with a thin layer of golden hooch on top. Alive. Arthur Crofton’s true legacy, preserved by his murderer.

As Sheriff Lowell led Maureen out, her head bowed, she paused at the threshold. “Feed it with equal parts rye and well water,” she said, not looking back. “He was particular about the water.”

Then she was gone, swallowed by the night and the flashing blue and red lights that now painted the street outside.

The following days were a blur of stark clarity. The video evidence from the festival tent—where Leo had discreetly set up his camera, capturing not just the sabotaged oven but the panicked, revealing conversations of the old conspirators as they scrambled—was released. The Bitterroot Gazette published a special edition that sold out in hours. The story unraveled like a poorly knit scarf: the former mayor’s deal to “rescue” the son of a wealthy, troubled family for a price, staging the disappearance to collect sympathy and a ransom of political capital; the boy hidden, then quietly placed with a cousin abroad; the decades of silence bought with favors and fear.

Arthur Crofton, the idealistic young baker, had discovered it by accident, a snippet of conversation overheard between his ambitious brother-in-law and the then-sheriff. He’d sat on the truth for years, letting it sour his soul, until he couldn’t anymore.

Elara was formally cleared. The apology from the district attorney was swift and public. So was the phone call from her old editor in the city.

“Elara! God, what a story. A masterpiece from the ashes. Your instincts were right all along. The column is yours again, bigger than ever. We’re talking a weekly feature, national syndication. Come home. Let’s get you back where you belong.”

She stood in Leo’s sun-drenched living room, the phone to her ear, watching him through the window. He was in the bakery below, sweeping out the last of the old debris, his movements steady and purposeful. She could smell the pine-scented cleaner they’d used, could see the first clean patches.
