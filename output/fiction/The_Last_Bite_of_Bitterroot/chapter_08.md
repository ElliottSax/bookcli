Chapter 8: Bulk Fermentation: Pressure Builds

Chapter 8: Bulk Fermentation: Pressure Builds

The sourdough starter on Elara Finch’s countertop was named Lazarus. It was a dramatic choice, but after Shaw’s death and the subsequent siege-like atmosphere of her own bakery, it felt apt. It was a thing that should have died, but instead, it lived with a fierce, bubbling tenacity. She fed it twice a day, watching the bubbles break the surface with soft, volcanic sighs. It smelled of ripe earth and green apples, a life-affirming scent that cut through the pervasive smell of fear that had seeped into the very floorboards.

Sheriff’s Deputy Miller, a man with the solid build and patient silence of a granite boulder, sat on a stool by the door, whittling a piece of pine. His presence was meant to be reassuring. It wasn’t. Every scrape of his knife was a reminder that someone had silenced Shaw, and that she and Leo were the loose threads left to snip.

Leo was at the big oak worktable, the Huckle ledger and her own flour-dusted notebook open side-by-side. The warm light of the pendant lamp pooled around him, but it couldn’t soften the new, grim set of his jaw. The revelation of his mother’s involvement—her name, Eleanor Croft, appearing in the ledger not as a victim but as a recipient of a ‘consultation fee’ from Mayor Sweetwater in the spring of 1978—had changed him. The easy charm was gone, replaced by a brittle focus.

“It’s not a recipe for bread,” Elara Finch said, her voice hushed. She leaned over the coded page they’d painstakingly translated. “It’s a recipe for the cover-up. Look.”

Her finger traced the ingredients. “One measure of sweet persuasion—that’s Mayor Sweetwater. His family’s maple syrup empire. He smoothed things over, used his charm and influence.”

She moved down. “A half-measure of gilded ash—Alistair Finch. The banker. He provided the money, burned the paper trails.”

“Water, drawn from a new, deep source, salted with tears,” Leo read aloud, his voice flat. “The dam. The reservoir that flooded the Huckle homestead and seven others. The tears are the displaced families.”

“And wild yeast, captured from the old growth, to be subdued and put to new purpose,” Elara Finch finished. She looked at him. “That’s your uncle. The law. He subdued the story, contained the truth, put the whole town to a new purpose: forgetting.”

Leo pushed back from the table, the chair legs screeching on the floor. He walked to the window, looking out at the dark, quiet The main street with weathered clapboard buildings of Bitterroot. “So my mother… her ‘consultation’. What was she? The butter to grease the pan?”

“Maybe she was the binder,” Elara Finch said softly. “Something that held disparate, ugly elements together. Family loyalty.”

He didn’t answer. The silence stretched, filled only by the pop of Lazarus and the shush-shush of Deputy Miller’s knife.

The final instruction in the coded recipe was clear: Combine with intention. Knead until the seams vanish. A single, grand loaf to feed the many. The Huckles hadn’t just wanted to record the crime; they’d wanted to replicate the structure of the conspiracy itself, to understand its architecture by tasting it.

“We have to make it,” Elara Finch said.

Leo turned. “What?”

“The loaf. We have to make it. It’s the only way to see what they saw. The process… it’ll tell us what we’re missing. Baking is sequence. It’s cause and effect.”

It was madness. It was also the only thing that made sense. The culinary mind sought truth in transformation, in the alchemy of heat and time.

She started small. A test loaf. She wouldn’t use the wild yeast from Arthur Crofton’s property, not yet. She used Lazarus. For the ‘sweet persuasion,’ she reduced a cup of Sweetwater’s finest maple syrup until it was a thick, smoky caramel. For the ‘gilded ash,’ she burned sugar in a cast-iron pan until it was a bitter, blackened carbon, then ground it to a powder. For the salted water, she sent Deputy Miller (after a brief, bewildered argument) to fetch a jar of water from the reservoir shore near where the Huckle house once stood.

Mixing the dough felt blasphemous. The maple caramel folded in like rusty veins. The ash sugar dusted it with grey. The reservoir water was shockingly cold, even in the warm kitchen. As she kneaded, the dough became a mottled, ugly thing, the color of a bruise. It resisted her, tearing where it should have stretched. It was a dough of conflict.

“It doesn’t want to be one thing,” she murmured, her hands deep in the sticky mass.

While it proofed in a bowl under a linen cloth, the invitation arrived. Mayor Sweetwater’s personal assistant, a nervous young man who wouldn’t meet her eye, handed her a thick, cream-colored envelope.

Miss Elara Finch Finch, it read in elegant script. Your dedication to our town’s history (and its bread) has been the talk of Bitterroot. I would be honored if you would join me for a private dinner at my home tomorrow evening. A chance to discuss the future, without the shadows of the past. Sincerely, Mayor Gregory Sweetwater.

It was a threat served on fine china. Leo read it over her shoulder, his breath warm and tense.

“You can’t go.”

“I have to,” she said. “Not going is an admission of guilt. Of knowing too much. Going… it’s a move. We keep kneading the dough.”

That night, the test loaf baked. The smell that filled the bakery was deeply wrong. The sweetness of the maple had curdled, mingling with the acrid tang of burnt sugar and a strange, alkaline scent from the reservoir water. It emerged from the oven a small, dense brick, its crust a cracked and fissured landscape of dark amber and soot.

They let it cool. Deputy Miller watched, his whittling paused.

Elara Finch sliced it. The crumb was tight, damp, and uneven. She handed a piece to Leo. They ate in silence.

The taste was a shock. It was not merely bad; it was accusatory. The initial hit was cloying, oppressive sweetness—the Mayor’s false charm. Then came a bitter, choking aftertaste—Finch’s greed. Underneath it all was a flat, metallic salinity, the taste of drowned land and stolen homes. The elements didn’t harmonize; they warred on the tongue. This was no grand loaf to feed the many. This was the truth of the cover-up: disparate, ugly parts forced together, creating something inedible.

“The seams didn’t vanish,” Leo said, dropping the remainder onto the table. “They’re the whole point.”

Elara Finch nodded, her mouth still coated with the unpleasantness. “We’re missing the binder. The thing that made this… palatable to the town. The thing that made it hold.”

The next afternoon, as Elara Finch was scrubbing the taste from her soul by baking a simple, honest rye, the bell over the door chimed. Deputy Miller stood up, his hand resting on his belt. Maureen Green stood in the doorway, a silhouette against the grey daylight. She wore a simple raincoat, her hands buried in its pockets. She looked like she hadn’t slept.

“I’d like a word,” she said, her eyes on Elara Finch, ignoring the deputy and Leo completely. “Alone. In the back.”

Miller began to protest, but Elara Finch raised a floury hand. “It’s fine, Deputy. We’ll be in the proofing room.”

The small, humid room was lined with resting dough. The air was thick with the smell of fermentation. Maureen seemed to shrink inside her coat. The confident editor was gone, replaced by a woman held together by fraying wire.

“I lied to you,” she said without preamble, her voice low. “About the boy. Peter Huckle.”

Elara Finch leaned against a cool stainless-steel table, saying nothing.

“I told you he vanished. That was the story. The story we printed.” Maureen’s gaze was fixed on a bulging bowl of dough, as if confessing to it. “After you left my office… I went digging. In my own home. In things my husband left behind.” She drew a shaky breath. “He was a good man, my Henry. But he was the editor. He knew the price of the truth in a town this small.”

From inside her coat, she withdrew a small, faded photograph. She held it out.

Elara Finch took it. It was a color photo, its tones gone warm and orange with age. It showed a boy of about twelve, grinning a gap-toothed grin, holding a large speckled trout. He was standing in front of a diner with a neon sign that read “The Big Sky Eats.” The style of his clothes, the cut of his hair—late seventies. The boy had the same straw-colored hair and sharp chin as the younger picture in the locket.

“This was taken in October 1979,” Maureen whispered. “In Missoula. Over a year after the flood. Over a year after he supposedly… vanished.”

The world narrowed to the photograph. The boy’s smile was real, unburdened. Alive.

“How?” Elara Finch managed.

“Money,” Maureen said, the word a bitter pill. “Finch’s money. Sweetwater’s connections. A new start for the last Huckle boy, far away from the drowned valley and the questions. His grandparents—the ones who gave you the ledger—they must have known. They must have agreed to it, to save him. But they couldn’t let it lie. They had to tell the story, their way.”

Elara Finch’s mind reeled. A payoff. Not a murder. A disappearance orchestrated by the town’s pillars. It was cleaner, quieter. But it didn’t fit. “Shaw,” she said. “Why kill Shaw now? If the boy just left, if it was all hushed up with cash, what secret was worth killing for forty-five years later?”

Maureen’s eyes, red-rimmed and exhausted, met hers. She pointed a trembling finger at the photograph. “Look at the tear.”

Elara Finch hadn’t noticed. The photo was roughly torn down the right side, cutting off part of the diner’s sign. Someone had been ripped out of the picture.

“The boy was paid to disappear,” Maureen said, her voice dropping to a thread of sound, almost lost in the gentle sighing of the proofing dough. “But the man who took him… the man who drove him to Missoula, who set him up in a new life, who made sure he never spoke a word of Bitterroot again… that’s the real secret. That’s the seam they truly hid.”

She leaned closer, and the smell of her fear cut through the yeast—a sharp, sour note. “Henry wrote one sentence in his private journal, the day before he died. Just one. ‘God help me, I gave him the keys.’”

Maureen’s gaze flickered toward the closed door, beyond which Leo waited. “It wasn’t just the law, or the money, or the water. It was family. It always is.” She turned to leave, then paused. “Burn that photo. You never saw it.”

She slipped out, leaving Elara Finch alone in the humid room, the torn photograph burning in her hand. The proofing dough around her swelled, expanding with invisible pressure, the gluten strands stretching taut, nearing their breaking point.

The binder. The missing ingredient that made the ugly conspiracy cohere. It wasn’t an ingredient you could measure in a cup. It was loyalty. It was blood. It was family.

The grand loaf wasn’t a metaphor for the cover-up. It was a metaphor for the town itself. And the man who had driven the boy away, the man entrusted by the editor, the man who could move between the worlds of law, finance, and politics without suspicion… he was the final, crucial fold in the dough. The one that sealed everything in.

Elara Finch looked down at the laughing boy in the photo, and then at the torn edge, where another man’s shoulder might have been. The hook sunk deep into her gut.

Who did you trust to do the unspeakable, and then pretend it never happened? The answer was whispering from the ledger, from the reservoir’s depths, from the very foundation of Leo’s fractured family. The final bake was coming, and she now knew the true, terrible shape of the loaf.
