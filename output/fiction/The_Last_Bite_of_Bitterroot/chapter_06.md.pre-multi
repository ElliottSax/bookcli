Chapter 6: Dam Water and Sourdough

Chapter 6: Dam Water and Sourdough

The rain began as Elara left the library, a fine, persistent mist that seemed less to fall from the sky than to condense from the very air of Bitterroot Valley. It beaded on the wool of her sweater and silvered the dark branches of the pines that crowded the road leading west out of town, towards the dam. The ledger, wrapped in a plastic bag and tucked under her arm, felt like a live thing, a cold ember of the past she was carrying into the damp present.

The entries they’d deciphered were sparse, chilling in their bureaucratic blandness. Dates in the summer and fall of 1978. Initials: ‘J.H.’, ‘M.S.’, ‘C.C.’—the latter, Leo confirmed with a grimace, likely his great-uncle, Crofton Crofton. And amounts, not huge but significant for a struggling valley. The description column held the code: ‘H-78 Final Harvest Compensation.’ The ‘H’ was circled in the same frantic ink as the note in the cookbook.

“Huckle,” Leo had said, staring at the page in the low light of his farm supply store office. The scent of fertilizer and burlap was a strange counterpoint to the historical poison they were uncovering. “Got to be. The Huckles had the biggest spread up the west fork. Or… they did.”

The west fork was now under sixty feet of water.

The Bitterroot Reservoir was a slick, steel-gray plate set into the crook of the mountains. The dam itself was a curved wedge of concrete, moss-stained and weeping from a thousand tiny seams. It hummed, a low, sub-auditory vibration Elara felt in her molars. The manager’s office was a concrete block cube clinging to the canyon wall beside it. A sign on the heavy metal door read: W. Griggs, Reservoir Manager. No Admittance Without Appointment.

Elara hadn’t called.

Wendell Griggs was a man shaped by wind and silence. Gaunt, with skin like cured leather and eyes the color of the reservoir’s deep water, he stood in his doorway, blocking any view of the interior. The smell of strong coffee and old motor oil wafted out.

“Mr. Griggs? Elara Finch. I’m—”

“I know who you are.” His voice was a gravel scrape. “The baker with questions.”

“I was hoping to talk about the reservoir. About 1978.”

His expression didn’t change. “Nothing to talk about. It holds water. It generates a trickle of power. It’s a dam.”

“There were homesteads here,” she pressed, the mist clinging to her eyelashes. “The Huckle place.”

A shutter came down behind his eyes. “Before my time. I read the reports. All voluntary buyouts. Eminent domain. Progress.”

“A boy went missing that year. Sam Huckle.”

Griggs took a slow sip from a chipped enamel mug. “Tragedy. Kids drown. Especially in new reservoirs. Hidden snags, cold water. Makes ’em panic.”

“Was his body ever found?”

“The water doesn’t give up all its secrets, Ms. Finch. And I don’t give out interviews.” He began to close the door. “Go bake your bread. Leave the deep water to those who understand its moods.”

The door clicked shut, the finality of the sound swallowed by the omnipresent hum. Elara stood there, the damp seeping through her shoes. Griggs hadn’t asked why she was there. He’d already known. Someone had talked. The thought was a new chill, separate from the mountain mist.

The code from the cookbook haunted her. ‘For the soaked days. For the water-risen. A porridge loaf, to fill the hollows.’ It was a recipe for hardship, for using the dregs, the leftovers, the last scraps before a winter flood or a failed crop. It felt like an answer to Griggs’s deep water, a way to touch the past not through confrontation, but through sustenance.

Back in her cabin’s kitchen, with the ledger open on the flour-dusted table, she began. The recipe was simple, austere. Coarse rye flour, a handful of rolled oats, a pinch of salt. No yeast. The leavening was a ‘sourdough porridge’—a scoop of her own vigorous starter stirred into simmering water and oats until it thickened into a gruel. The smell was primal, earthy, like wet grain and hot stone.

As she mixed the thick, sticky dough—more a batter, really—she thought of a woman in a kitchen not unlike this one, seventy years ago, looking out at a rising creek. She thought of Sam Huckle’s mother, maybe using this very recipe in the autumn of 1978, the waters of the new reservoir already creeping up the road towards her door. To fill the hollows. What hollows had that flood created?

She baked it in a scalded cast-iron pot. The loaf that emerged was dense, dark, with a crust like riverbed clay. It sang a low, hollow note when tapped. She broke a piece. The crumb was moist, close-grained, faintly tart. It tasted of patience, of scarcity, of making do. It was the antithesis of Mayor Sweetwater’s golden, syrupy luxury. This was the bread of the drowned.

She was wiping her hands, the taste of rye and time still on her tongue, when her phone buzzed with an unknown local number. A text, brief and to the point: ‘Ask Boyd Jensen about the Huckle survey. He’s at 37 Aspen Lane. He’s waiting.’

Her heart thumped against her ribs. Anonymous. It could be a trap. But Leo was in the valley, checking on a shipment. She was alone with her bread and her ghosts. She pocketed a serrated knife, feeling foolish and fierce, and drove back into town.

Boyd Jensen lived in a small, neat bungalow on the older side of Bitterroot. A retired surveyor’s tripod stood on the porch, holding a hanging basket of dead petunias. He answered her knock immediately, as if he’d been standing at the window. He was a small man, bent like a question mark, with bright, bird-like eyes behind thick glasses.

“You’re Elara,” he said, not asking. “Come in. I made tea.”

His living room was a museum of maps. Topographical sheets were pinned to walls, rolled in cylinders, spread under the glass of his coffee table. The valley, in all its incarnations. The air smelled of paper, ink, and peppermint tea.

“You got my message,” he said, handing her a delicate china cup.

“Was it you?”

“The message? No. But I said I’d talk to you if you came. Saw you at the dam. Griggs is a vault. But I’m not.” He settled into a worn armchair with a sigh. “I surveyed the west fork for the dam project. Spring of ‘78. Beautiful land. Hard, but beautiful. The Huckles had a sweet little spread. Apple trees, a good spring. Sam… he’d follow me around. Curious kid. Wanted to know what all the numbers and theodolites meant.”

Elara set her cup down, careful not to let it rattle. “What happened to them?”

Jensen stared into the valley on his coffee table. “The buyout was messy. The price was fair, maybe even generous. But old man Huckle, he didn’t want money. He wanted his land. His family had been there since the silver rush. There were… delays. Arguments. The injunction failed. The flood date was set.”

He took a long, shaky breath. “The official evacuation was completed October 28th. The reservoir began filling November 1st. But my job… I had to do a final check on November 2nd. A formality. Water was already pooling in the low spots.” His voice dropped to a whisper. “I saw smoke from their chimney.”

The words hung in the map-cluttered room. The cheerful tick of a mantle clock was suddenly obscene.

“You reported it?”

“Of course I did!” he said, his voice cracking. “I called the project office. Crofton Crofton himself took the call. He told me it was probably just the Huckles collecting the last of their personal effects. That it was handled. To file my report and go home.”

“And did you?”

He looked at her, his eyes magnified and swimming with guilt behind his lenses. “I filed the report. But I also went down there. The water was rising fast, a silent, creeping thing. I got to the ridge above their homestead. The house… it was still there. The barn. The truck was gone. But there was a bicycle by the porch. Sam’s bicycle.” He swallowed hard. “I told myself they’d left in a hurry. That they’d come back for it. I was about to leave when I saw a man in a suit leaving the house. Not Huckle. He got into a dark sedan I hadn’t seen parked in the trees. He drove away, right through the first inch of water on the road.”

“Did you see who it was?”

“No. Not his face. But the car… it had a sticker on the bumper. A little maple leaf. The Sweetwater Syrup logo.”

The taste of the mayor’s golden loaf turned to ash in Elara’s memory.

“What did you do?”

“Nothing,” Jensen said, the word a confession. “I was young. I needed the work. Crofton called me the next day, said there’d been a clerical error, the Huckles had been fully compensated for a ‘last-minute logistical oversight.’ He offered me a bonus for my ‘thoroughness.’ He implied my career would flow smoothly if the final survey was clean. And the water… the water kept rising. By the next week, the house was gone. The bicycle. Everything. And then the story was the boy had run off, maybe fallen in the new lake. A tragedy.”

“They were paid to stay quiet,” Elara murmured, thinking of the ledger. ‘H-78 Final Harvest Compensation.’ It wasn’t for the land. It was for their silence, for their son.

“The boy was the harvest,” Jensen whispered, echoing her horror. “They didn’t just flood a valley, Ms. Finch. They drowned a truth. And Crofton, Sweetwater, the others… they built their peace on that silt.”

Elara drove back to her cabin in a daze. The mist had turned to a steady, cold rain that blurred the world. The warm, tactile comfort of her kitchen felt like a distant dream. Sam Huckle had been on his homestead when the waters came. His family had been paid. And someone—Crofton, maybe Mayor Sweetwater’s father—had made sure the project’s paperwork was cleaner than its conscience.

She pushed open her cabin door, heavy with the weight of the story, and froze.

The world was upside down. Cushions were slashed, their stuffing like coarse snow across the floor. Her grandmother’s recipe box was upended, cards scattered like fallen leaves. Every drawer in the kitchen hung open, contents spilling out. Her few books had been swept from their shelves. The violence of it was a physical blow.

A small, wounded sound escaped her. She stumbled inside, her boots crunching on flour. They’d emptied her canister of bread flour across every surface. And then she saw it, on the butcher block counter, cleared amidst the chaos.

A single word, written in a furious, sweeping hand with the stolen flour:

STOP.

It wasn’t a request. It was a command, etched in the very substance of her craft. The air left her lungs. She backed away, her shoulder hitting the doorframe. They hadn’t just warned her. They had violated her sanctuary, using the symbol of her comfort, her investigation, as the medium for their threat. The ledger was gone. Of course it was gone.

She fumbled for her phone, her fingers numb. Leo’s number rang once, twice.

“Elara?” His voice, usually so grounded, was sharp with concern.

“They were here,” she managed, her voice trembling. “The cabin. It’s… they wrote…”

“Get out,” he said, immediate and firm. “Right now. Don’t touch anything. Go to the Mocha Moose, stay in the light with people. I’m ten minutes away.”

“They took the ledger, Leo. They know everything we know.”

“Then we’re dangerous,” he said, and she could hear the engine of his truck roar to life over the line. “And dangerous people don’t get warnings. They get silenced. Move, Elara. Now.”

She turned, ready to flee into the wet, dark evening. But as she did, her eye caught a single, white rectangle on the floor near the upturned recipe box. One card had fallen face-down, spared the floury desecration. She bent, her muscles screaming in protest, and picked it up.

It was her grandmother’s recipe. The one that had started it all. The Last Bite of Bitterroot. And there, in the margin, in her grandmother’s now-familiar script, was a new note she hadn’t seen before, a tiny addendum to the instructions for toasting the bitterroot flour:

“For a hidden bitterness, use the water from the west fork spring. It remembers the stones.”*

She clutched the card to her chest, a fragile talisman against the floury threat on the counter. They had taken the ledger. But they hadn’t known about the deeper recipe, the one written in code and memory. The water remembered. And so would she.

She ran out into the drowning rain, the card safe in her pocket, the word STOP burning like a brand in the ruined kitchen behind her.
