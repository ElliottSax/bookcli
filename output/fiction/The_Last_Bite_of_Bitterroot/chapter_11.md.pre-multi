Chapter 11: The Crust Shatters

The scent of burnt sugar and panic hung over the Harvest Festival’s baking pavilion. It was a smell Elara knew in her bones, the acrid cousin of caramelization, of attention gone horribly wrong. One moment, she was carefully scoring the massive, intricate loaf—Crofton’s final, damning recipe brought to life—before the assembled, murmuring town. The next, a piercing shriek from the oven timer, not a ding but a wail, and a plume of bitter, black smoke curled from the vents.

Sabotage. The word crackled through the crowd faster than the flames the volunteer fire department now doused. Someone had reprogrammed the oven, cranked it to infernal levels the moment the loaf went in. The beautiful, braided crust—a tapestry of rye from the mill, honey from the Hive, salt from the old mine, and yeast Leo had cultivated from Crofton’s own starter—was now a charred monument.

Sheriff Alden’s face was granite, his men forming a useless cordon around a crime already committed. Elara’s hands, flour-dusted and trembling, weren't trembling from fear, but from a cold, clarifying rage. They had been so close. The public unveiling of the loaf, its ingredients a silent accusation, was supposed to force the killer’s hand. Instead, it gave them a chance to strike.

“They had access,” Elara muttered, brushing a fleck of blackened crust from her apron. It disintegrated at her touch. “They had to get to the oven before the competition. During setup.”

Leo, his usual calm replaced by a sharp-edged alertness, followed her gaze as it swept the pavilion. The crowd was a sea of shocked faces, but some eyes were too still, too watchful. “Setup was overseen by the festival committee,” he said, voice low. “And the historical society. They had the master keys.”

A piece clicked. Not just access, but knowledge. Knowledge of ovens, of timing. The kind of knowledge a baker, or a historian who’d spent a lifetime documenting Bitterroot’s traditions, would possess.

“I need to go back,” Elara said.

“Back where? It’s a circus here.”

“To the beginning. The Wild Loaf.”

Leo didn’t argue. He saw the certainty in her eyes, the same focus she had when her fingers shaped dough. “I’ll keep the circus occupied,” he said. He strode towards Sheriff Alden, his voice rising in theatrical anger. “Sheriff! This is negligence! This oven was under your protection! I demand a full inventory of every person who came near it!”

As Alden sputtered and the crowd’s attention swung toward the confrontation, Elara melted into the periphery, a shadow in her flour-smudged jeans and sweater. The autumn air outside the tent was a shock, crisp and appled, washing the smoke from her lungs. She cut through back alleys, the festive bunting strung between buildings flapping like anxious ghosts overhead.

The Wild Loaf was dark, a missing tooth in the quaint row of storefronts. The police tape across the door, faded and torn, fluttered in the breeze. Elara didn’t hesitate.
