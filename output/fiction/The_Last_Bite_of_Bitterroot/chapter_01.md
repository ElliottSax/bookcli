Chapter 1: A Sourdough Tomb

A sigh of hydraulic resignation escaped the Greyhound bus as Elara Finch stepped onto the cracked asphalt of Bitterroot’s only stop—a gravel pull-off beside a shuttered feed store. Thin and sharp as a paring knife, the air carried pine resin and distant woodsmoke, a clean scent she hoped could scour her clean, too. Her single suitcase, its leather worn soft at the corners, held three notebooks and a copper whisk alongside her clothes, the last artifacts of a life incinerated by a single headline: FORKED TONGUE: The Fabricated Tastes of Elara Finch. Swift, brutal, and not entirely unjust, the scandal had erupted after a moment of cynical fatigue led her to describe the mouthfeel of a truffle foam at a restaurant she’d never visited. The chef, it turned out, had a vengeful sous-chef with proof. Her career, her credibility, her entire identity built on the premise of an honest palate—all dissolved like sugar in hot oil.

Bitterroot, a speck on the map in the shadow of the Cabinet Mountains, was to be her monastery. Here, no one read food blogs, let alone the New York Times dining section. A place to disappear, and perhaps, to remember what real taste was.

Weathered clapboard buildings, some painted in faded blues and greens, leaned into the mountain’s embrace along the main street. They housed a hardware store, a post office, and a tavern whose neon beer signs glowed weakly in the overcast afternoon light. Quiet, but not peaceful, the silence held its breath before a storm.

Her rented room above the post office, owned by a whispering Mabel, smelled of dust and beeswax beneath its sloping ceilings and floral wallpaper. A jar of wild huckleberry jam waited on the dresser. Unpacking her whisk, Elara set it on the windowsill where it caught the grey light. From this vantage, she could see the length of the street, and at the very end, tucked where the road curved into forest, a building with a hand-painted sign: Artisan Baking. Knock for Orders. Arthur Crofton. “The Starter.”

His name was legend in certain obscure culinary circles—a recluse who’d supposedly turned down a Bon Appétit feature, a baker whose sourdough was spoken of in hushed, almost mystical terms. He was her reason, her excuse. She would write a quiet, personal piece on his craft, a true piece, a penance piece. No one would publish it, and that was the point.

Dawn the next morning seeped silver through the mountain mist. Dressed in plain wool, Elara walked, the cold air needling her lungs. A block from the bakery, the smell reached her first. Not just the simple, wholesome scent of baking bread, but something deeper, wilder, more alive—the tangy, profound smell of fermentation, cut through with the caramel note of scorched flour from a hot oven floor. It was the smell of time and transformation.

The bakery, a converted cabin with logs dark from age, had windows steamed from within. No “Open” sign hung in the door, which stood slightly ajar. Odd for 5:45 AM, the sacred hour of bakers. A faint, rhythmic gurgle echoed from inside, like a giant’s digestion.

“Hello?” Pushing the door open released a dense, humid warmth that carried the full force of that extraordinary smell. The cavernous room held a massive, blackened brick oven to the left, its iron door shut. To the right, a long wooden table lay dusted with flour, a silent testament to kneading. But the heart of the room, its literal and figurative center, stole her breath.

A huge, ceramic vat, the size of a small hot tub, sat sunken into the floor, filled with a pale, bubbling beige substance—Arthur Crofton’s famous mother starter. It breathed. *Plip. Blup.* A slow, volcanic eruption of bubbles broke the surface, releasing a puff of sour gas. Mesmerizing and faintly primordial.

“Mr. Crofton?”

Her eyes adjusted to the dim light from a single, fly-specked bulb over the worktable. A shape in the vat. Her mind refused the information. A sack of flour? A discarded apron? But the flour sacks were stacked neatly against the wall. And aprons didn’t have sleeves. Or hair.

A man’s back, clad in a faded plaid shirt, was submerged in the starter up to his shoulders. His head tilted back, resting on the rim of the vat as if in exhausted repose. Grey, wispy hair was matted with glutinous goo. His face, turned slightly toward the ceiling, was pale and still, eyes closed. A dollop of starter clung to his cheek like a grotesque, fermenting tear.

Elara’s hand flew to her mouth. The sour, yeasty smell turned cloying, suffocating. The gentle *blup* of the starter now sounded like a morbid heartbeat. Stumbling backward, her hip connected with the flour-dusted table. A cloud of white puffed into the air, settling like ground fog over the scene.

Logic, trained by a lifetime of observing details, fought through the shock. No blood. No visible wound. Just a man, seemingly asleep, drowned in his own life’s work.

Fumbling for her phone found no signal. Of course.

She ran out into the cold street, the pristine air a shock. “Help!” Her voice, unused to shouting, cracked. A light flicked on in a window across the street. The tavern door opened, and a burly man in suspenders stepped out.

“What’s the racket?” he grumbled.

“It’s… the baker. Arthur Crofton. I think he’s dead.”

The man’s face went slack. He didn’t ask who she was. He just turned and bellowed into the tavern, “Daryl, call Roy Briggs! It’s Arthur.” Sheriff Roy Briggs arrived not with sirens, but with the grim, deliberate pace of a man who knows the finality of what awaits him. He was in his late fifties, with a face carved from the same granite as the mountains, and eyes the color of a winter lake. He took in the scene with a long, silent sweep, his gaze lingering on the vat, then on Elara Finch, who stood shivering by the oven, arms wrapped around herself. He directed his deputy, a young man with a prominent Adam’s apple, to cordon off the area. He didn’t touch the body, just observed it from every angle, his jaw working. A photographer arrived, the flash stark and blasphemous in the sacred, steamy space. Finally, Roy Briggs approached Elara Finch. “You found him.” It wasn’t a question. “Yes. I’m Elara Finch Finch. I just arrived in town yesterday. I was coming to see him. About his bread.” “Elara Finch Finch.” He repeated her name, and something shifted in his cold eyes. A flicker of recognition, and then a hardening. “The food writer.” Her stomach dropped. “Yes.” “The one who got caught making things up.” The words, spoken in his flat, mountain accent, were more brutal than any tabloid headline. They held the simple, devastating weight of fact. “I’m not here to write anything,” she said, her voice thin. “I’m… on sabbatical.” “Sabbatical,” he echoed, unconvinced. He looked from her to the vat and back. “Convenient timing. A disgraced critic shows up, and the town’s most famous recluse turns up dead in his own batter.” “It’s not batter. It’s a sourdough starter,” she said automatically, then winced at how it sounded. A ghost of a grim smile touched his lips. “Right. My mistake.” He pulled out a notebook. “Walk me through it. Exactly.” She did, leaving nothing out. The open door, the sound, the horrifying sight. He listened, writing in a slow, deliberate hand. “Did you touch anything? Besides the door and the table?” “The table? Oh, when I stumbled. Just that.” He nodded toward the table. A perfect, flour-dusted imprint of her hip and hand. “You left your mark.” The deputy called him over. The medical examiner, a weary-looking woman, had arrived. Roy Briggs turned back to Elara Finch. “Don’t leave town, Ms. Finch. We’ll have more questions.” He didn’t say “suspect,” but the word hung in the humid air, another ingredient in the foul mix. Elara Finch fled back to her room. She scrubbed her hands until they were raw, but the smell of the starter—yeasty, sour, deathly—seemed embedded in her sinuses. She saw his pale face every time she closed her eyes. By mid-afternoon, a restlessness worse than fear drove her back out. The street was unnaturally quiet. Curtains twitched. She felt the weight of the town’s gaze, a collective, suspicious stare. She found herself outside the library, a small stone building. Inside, it was warm and smelled of old paper. The librarian, a woman with kind eyes behind thick glasses, didn’t seem to recognize her. Elara Finch asked if there were any local newspapers or historical archives. “Microfiche in the back, dear,” the librarian said. “Everything from the Bitterroot Sentinel from 1952 onward. What are you looking for?” “I’m not sure,” Elara Finch said truthfully. She spent an hour scrolling through blurry, grey pages. Births, deaths, town council debates about snowplow routes. Then, in the October 12, 1978, edition, a small headline: Record Harvest Ends in Tragedy. The article was vague. A fire in a grain silo on the old Henderson farm. One casualty: Samuel Henderson, age 24. The silo was a total loss. The sheriff at the time, a man named T. Roy Briggs—Roy’s father, perhaps—was quoted calling it a “tragic accident.” She noted it, a pinprick of darkness in the town’s history, but saw no link to a baker forty-five years later. As dusk bled into the mountains, painting them violet, Elara Finch realized what was pulling at her. It wasn’t the horror of the vat. It was the stillness of the bakery. The oven cold. The starter, that living, breathing entity, now a crime scene. And the man who tended it, gone. A craftsman’s sanctuary violated. It felt profoundly wrong, a dish with a crucial, irreplaceable ingredient missing. And she had left her mark on his table. A ghost in flour. Driven by a composure she didn’t understand, she walked back toward The bakery with its old brick oven (central location). The police tape, garish yellow, fluttered across the door. A single deputy sat in a cruiser parked a discreet distance away, watching. The back of the bakery, she’d noticed earlier, abutted a thick stand of pine trees. Moving with a quietness born of city living, she slipped into the tree line. The back door was a simple wooden one, unlocked. Roy Briggs was a small-town sheriff; his thoroughness likely didn’t extend to the rear entrance of a clear accident scene. Was it an accident? The question, now fully formed, chilled her. She slipped inside, into a small storeroom smelling of paper sacks and molasses. The main bakery was dark, lit only by the eerie blue glow of the deputy’s laptop screen filtering through the front windows. The vat was empty now, the starter presumably taken as evidence. A dark, tidemark stained its ceramic side. The room felt corpse-cold, the warmth and life utterly extracted. On a rickety desk in the corner, beneath a shelf holding The Professional Pastry Chef and On Food and Cooking, sat an old desktop computer. Its monitor was black. On impulse, Elara Finch jiggled the mouse. The screen flickered to life, blindingly bright. No password. It was open to an email client. The draft folder contained a single, unsent message. The recipient list was simply: Newsletter List. The subject line: Final Feeding. Her heart hammered against her ribs. She clicked. It began like all his previous newsletters, which she’d devoured online. A poetic observation about the weather on the mountain, a note on the temperament of the starter (“She is sluggish today, dreaming of colder climes…”), and a meticulously detailed recipe for a seeded rye. But halfway down, the text changed. …and so, if you are reading this, the loaf of my days is fully proofed and baked. I have no regrets, save one: that I took a secret to be my salt. It has preserved nothing but regret. They think a starter is just flour and water. It is not. It is memory. It is the taste of a specific place, a specific time. It remembers the wheat field, the minerality of the water, the air the day it was born. And mine… mine remembers the Henderson silo, and the lie we kneaded into the town’s bread to make it rise. The truth is the bitterest root. It grows in the dark. If you seek it, look not to the harvest of ’78, but to what was buried to make it sweet. Find the missing ingredient. It is not in the recipe, but in the hand that measures. The newsletter ended abruptly, unsigned. Elara Finch stared at the screen, the words searing themselves into her mind. A secret to be my salt. The lie we The doorknob rattled, then turned. The deputy was coming back in.

Elara Finch’s gaze snapped back to the computer screen, to Arthur’s final, blinking line: “For the starter, you must use the mother. She is buried in the usual place.”

The front door creaked open, letting in a slice of cold night air. “All secure out here,” the deputy called.

“Thank you,” Elara Finch managed, her voice strangely calm. Her mind was racing, a frantic counterpoint to her frozen body. The mother. The usual place.* It wasn’t a recipe. It was a location.

And she knew exactly where. Arthur had shown her the old, gnarled apple tree on his property, the one he’d called “the usual place” for his compost. A place to bury kitchen scraps, to return things to the earth.

To hide a body.

The medical examiner’s furious, intimate face flashed in her mind. Roy Briggs’s obedient posture. They weren’t just covering up a poisoning. They were guarding a grave.

The deputy’s footsteps echoed on the bakery tiles, coming closer to the office door. Elara Finch’s hand moved on instinct, ejecting the flash drive and closing the file. The screen went dark, swallowing Arthur’s confession.

But the words were now etched into her, a map to a terrible truth. Arthur Arthur Crofton hadn’t just known about the poisoned harvest. He had helped bury its first victim. And the people sworn to protect this town were standing guard over that secret.

The deputy’s shadow fell across the office threshold. Elara Finch turned, forcing a thin smile. Outside, the streetlamp illuminated the medical examiner, now staring directly at the bakery window, her expression no longer furious, but coldly, patiently calculating. She knew Elara Finch had seen. She knew the recipe had been read.

The truth wasn’t just a bitter root. It was a seed. And Elara Finch had just swallowed it whole.
