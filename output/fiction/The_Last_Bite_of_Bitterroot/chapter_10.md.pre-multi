Chapter 10: The Oven Spring

Chapter 10: The Oven Spring

The sourdough starter, fed with rye flour and rainwater, bubbled like a peat bog in its glass jar. Elara watched it, her reflection warped in the curved glass. It was a living thing, this starter—a century-old legacy of wild yeast and bacteria passed from Crofton’s hands, to her grandmother’s, to hers. Now, it was the heart of a trap.

Outside the kitchen window of The Bitter End, Main Street was being dressed for the Harvest Festival. Bunting in gold and crimson flapped against a sky the color of cold slate. Pumpkins lined the sidewalks, their cheerful grins looking, to Elara, like grimaces. The air smelled of woodsmoke from the festival’s newly constructed brick oven, and beneath it, the damp, mineral scent of the coming frost.

“It’s time,” Leo said, entering from the back. He carried a brown paper bag, its contents clinking softly. He looked exhausted, shadows pooled under eyes that wouldn’t quite meet hers. The revelation about his mother, about the hidden alliance between the Crofts and the Huckles, hung between them like a pane of smoked glass. They could see each other through it, but everything was blurred, darkened.

“Did you get everything?” Elara asked, her voice quieter than she intended.

He nodded, unpacking the bag with a reverence usually reserved for holy relics. “The white flour, milled from the last of the Sweetwater family’s private wheat reserve. Took some ‘donating to the festival’ persuasion.” It was a fine, almost blue-tinged powder. “The honey.” He placed a small, elegant jar on the counter. The label, in florid script, read Huckle Haven Clover & Fireweed. It was the color of old amber, thick and slow. “The salt.” This was in a plain muslin pouch. Grey, flaky, hand-harvested from the flats near the old quarry owned, through a labyrinth of LLCs, by the mayor’s brother-in-law. “And the water.” He set down a canteen. “Drawn this morning from the spring on what used to be Crofton’s north pasture. Now part of the Gantry land trust.”

Each ingredient was a piece of the map. The flour from the Sweetwaters’ ambition, the honey from the Huckles’ poisoned legacy, the salt from the hidden corruption, the water from the stolen land. And the starter, the living history, the Croft family’s own complicity.

“Your mother?” Elara finally asked, kneading the stiff levain into the autolysed flour and water.

Leo’s jaw tightened. “She won’t speak to me. Just sits in her sunroom, staring at the mountain. She looks… small.” He picked up the jar of honey, turning it in the light. “All these years, she let me believe Crofton was a monster. She let the town believe it. To protect what? A deal? A name?”

“To protect you, maybe,” Elara said, though the words felt thin. “Or the illusion of stability. Some people will do anything to keep the pot from boiling over, even if it means letting the stew spoil from within.”

The dough came together, a shaggy mass in the bowl. Elara began to fold in the salt, then the honey, drizzling its golden sweetness slowly. The conspiracy, made tangible. It was a heavy dough, dense with symbolism and spite. She worked it in silence, the only sound the sticky pull of gluten and the distant thump of a hammer from the festival square.

“He’s here, you know,” Leo said after a while. “The ‘missing’ boy. He’s staying at the motor lodge out on the highway. Calls himself Robert Vale now.”

Elara remembered the man they’d tracked down—a quiet, nervous accountant from Spokane with Crofton’s same anxious blue eyes. He hadn’t been bribed, he’d been paid off. A monthly stipend, a new identity, a sealed file, all arranged by a lawyer whose name made both Sweetwater and Huckle flinch. His testimony, given in a trembling voice over bad motel coffee, was the final piece. Crofton hadn’t killed a boy. He’d discovered one—a Huckle son from a concealed affair—and had tried to use the knowledge as leverage to stop the land grab. It backfired spectacularly.

“He’s agreed to be there today,” Elara said, turning the dough out for its final fold. “When the time is right.”

“If the time is right,” Leo corrected, his gaze on the window. “They know we’re doing this. They’re scared. Scared people are unpredictable.”

Elara shaped the dough into a round, the surface tense and smooth as a drum. She placed it in a linen-lined banneton, the spiral of the cane imprinting a final, target-like pattern on its surface. She covered it with a cloth. “The oven is already lit. The trap is set. All we can do now is spring it.”

The town square was a study in forced merriment. The wood-fired oven, a hulting brick dome, glowed like a furnace heart at the center. Children darted between stalls selling apple butter and knitted scarves, their laughter sharp against the tense backdrop. The entire population of Bitterroot seemed to be there, their attention split between the pie-eating contest and the curious spectacle at the oven.

Elara and Leo stood behind a long trestle table. The shaped loaf, dusted with flour from the Sweetwater reserve, sat between them like an exhibit. A microphone had been set up. Sheriff Lowry lingered at the edge of the crowd, his face a mask of professional neutrality, but his hand never strayed far from his belt.

Elara took a breath, the cold air biting her lungs. She tapped the mic. A screech of feedback silenced the square.

“People of Bitterroot,” she began, her voice echoing off the storefronts. “For decades, you’ve celebrated this harvest, this land. And for decades, you’ve lived with a ghost. The ghost of Alistair Crofton. A murderer, you were told. A monster who stole a child and was killed for it.”

A hush fell, deeper than before. The only sound was the crackle of the fire in the oven’s mouth.

“But ghosts are rarely what they seem. My grandmother left me his legacy. Not a legacy of shame, but one of truth. Encoded in his final recipes.” She gestured to the loaf. “Today, with Leo Croft’s help, we finish his last work. ‘The Guardian’s Loaf.’ And as it bakes, I’ll tell you its true story. The story of this town.”

She nodded to Leo. Together, they carried the loaf to the oven’s mouth on a long wooden peel. The heat blasted them, a wave of dry fury that stole their breath. With a practiced slide, the dough landed on the hot brick floor with a soft, decisive thump. Leo sealed the iron door with a clang.

Elara returned to the mic, her face flushed from the heat. “The flour,” she said, holding up the nearly empty sack. “The finest white, from a private strain. A symbol of purity, of prominence. Of a family that wanted to be the whitest, finest thing in the valley.” Her eyes found Mayor Sweetwater in the front row. He stood, arms crossed, a tight smile on his face, but a vein pulsed in his temple. “A family that would broker any deal, bury any history, to maintain that position.”

A murmur rippled through the crowd. Harold Gantry, looking paler than usual, took a step back.

“The honey,” Elara continued, raising the jar. It glowed in the grey light. “Sweet, golden, irresistible. The product of a family business built on a name that everyone trusted. But sometimes, honey can hide the taste of something bitter. Sometimes, an empire is built on a single, buried secret.” Her gaze swept to where Lyle Huckle stood, surrounded by his grandchildren. The old man’s affable mask slipped, revealing a granite hardness beneath.

“The salt,” she said, shaking the pouch. “Grey, essential, mined from the earth. It preserves. It also corrodes. It comes from the quarry whose profits have silently funded campaigns, smoothed over permits, and ensured that certain stories never saw the light of day.” The mayor’s brother-in-law, a large man in a checkered coat, turned and began pushing his way out of the crowd.

“The water,” Elara said, her voice growing stronger. “Drawn from a spring on land that was stolen through forged documents and legal trickery. Water that should have nourished a different future.”

“This is an outrage!” Mayor Sweetwater’s voice cut through the narrative, smooth as butter but laced with panic. “This… this festival is a celebration, not a platform for slanderous, half-baked conspiracy theories from a woman facing serious charges!”

“The charges you pushed for, Mayor?” Leo spoke into his own mic, his voice calm but carrying. “To discredit her before she could finish this?”

The crowd’s energy shifted, from curious to electric. This was no longer a baking demonstration; it was a confrontation.

“The final ingredient,” Elara pressed on, raising her voice over the growing buzz. “Is the starter. The living history. Passed down through generations of Crofts. A family that made a terrible choice: to hide a truth to protect a name, to trade justice for a fragile peace.” She looked at Leo, then out at the sea of faces. “Crofton didn’t kill a Huckle boy. He found him. A boy hidden away because his existence was inconvenient. Crofton tried to use that knowledge to stop the land grab that would become Huckle Haven. And for that, he was killed. The boy was paid to disappear, and Crofton was framed as a murderer to silence him forever.”

The square erupted. Gasps, shouts, denials. Lyle Huckle bellowed, “Lies!” but the sound was choked. Mayor Sweetwater was at the sheriff’s side, gripping his arm, his face crimson, speaking in a rapid, low hiss.

Elara saw Robert Vale then, the missing boy, now a middle-aged man with tired eyes, standing at the back near the sheriff’s deputy. He gave a single, almost imperceptible nod.

Sheriff Lowry shook off the mayor’s hand and stepped forward. “Mayor Sweetwater, Lyle Huckle, Harold Gantry… I think you all need to come down to the station to answer some questions. Based on new evidence.”

The scene dissolved into chaos. The mayor was sputtering. Huckle’s family closed ranks around him. Gantry seemed to be trying to shrink into his coat. As the sheriff and his deputies moved in, Elara felt a dizzying rush of vindication and terror. It was done. The truth was out.

And then, through the din, a sound pierced through.

Ding.

The oven timer.

The loaf. The final proof.

The crowd’s attention, fractious and volatile, swung back to the oven. This was the tangible result, the physical manifestation of the story. The truth, baked into bread.

Elara, her hands trembling now, took up the peel. Leo stood beside her, a solid presence. The iron door was hot. She hooked it and pulled.

A gust of fragrant, blisteringly hot air rolled out, carrying the profound, primal scent of baked grain—the smell of home, of safety, of simple goodness. She slid the peel into the dark mouth of the oven, seeking the loaf.

Her heart stuttered.

It wasn’t right. The scent was undercut by something else, something acrid and burnt. She hooked the loaf and drew it out into the grey afternoon light.

A collective sound, a mix of confusion and disappointment, rose from those close enough to see.

The loaf was not the perfect, burnished globe it should have been. It was a ruin. Someone had slashed it not with the elegant, single score of a baker’s blade, but with vicious, ragged gashes—a crude, angry ‘X’ ripped across its surface. The cuts had torn, not opened beautifully. One side had collapsed in the oven’s heat, a slumped and sorrowful mess. And from the deepest gash, not steam, but a tendril of thin, dark smoke curled, carrying the bitter scent of charred honey and malice.

Nestled in the largest fissure, half-baked into the torn crumb, was a folded slip of parchment.

The world narrowed to that ruined loaf, that smoking note. The cacophony of the square—the shouting, the sheriff’s orders, the weeping—faded to a dull roar. Elara, moving as if in a dream, used a pair of tongs to pluck the parchment from its searing nest. It was hot, slightly greasy. She unfolded it.

The handwriting was a familiar, elegant script she’d seen in ledger margins and recipe cards. But the message was not Crofton’s.

Some starters should never be fed.*

Leo read it over her shoulder, his breath catching. He understood first. His head snapped up, his eyes scanning the frantic crowd not for the mayor or Huckle, but for a different face. A face that knew about starters. A face that had been in the kitchen. A face that had been “protected” by the sheriff.

Elara followed his gaze, the pieces locking into a new, horrifying configuration. The protection that felt like surveillance. The easy access. The deep, intimate knowledge of Crofton’s work that went beyond ledgers. The person who stood to lose not just power or wealth, but an entire identity, if the true story of the Croft family’s capitulation came to light.

Across the square, standing calmly beside Sheriff Lowry’s parked cruiser, was Leo’s mother, Imogen Croft. She wore a sensible wool coat and a placid expression. But her eyes, cold and clear as the spring water, were fixed on Elara. And as their gazes met, Imogen gave a small, almost imperceptible shake of her head. Not a denial.

A warning.

The conspiracy hadn’t ended with the mayor’s arrest. It had simply risen, like a dormant starter fed with fear and legacy, and it had been in the kitchen with them all along. The final bite of the bitterroot was not in the town’s corruption, but in the betrayal that had seasoned it from within the family itself. The loaf, their beautiful, damning proof, was a mutilated sacrifice. And the baker who had defiled it was still free.
