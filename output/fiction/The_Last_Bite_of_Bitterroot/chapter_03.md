## **Chapter 3: The First Rise: Mayor Sweetwater's Syrup**

A shroud of mist clung to the morning after Elara’s unsettling discovery in the newsletter, so thick that breathing it in was like inhaling cold, gray wool. It muffled the world, turning the familiar pines outside her rented cabin into spectral sentinels and reducing the distant mountains to mere suggestions of themselves. The only sounds were the mournful drip-drip-drip of condensation from the cedar-shingled roof and the distant, hollow knock of a loose shutter down the lane. On a relentless loop in her mind played the coded recipe: *“Begin with the sweetest sap, the golden heart of a gilded name. Temper its warmth with the patience of winter, and proof it in the shadow of the crown.”* That “gilded name” could only be Sweetwater. The town’s maple syrup dynasty was its sole claim to gilding, its amber wealth flowing through the veins of Bitterroot’s history.
The cabin’s floorboards were icy under her bare feet. She wrapped her hands around a mug of strong black tea, the heat seeping into her bones, and stared into the vapor. Arthur Crofton hadn’t just been a baker; he’d been an archivist of flavor, a chronicler of secrets kneaded into dough. This recipe was a map. And she had no choice but to follow it.

Housed in a surprisingly grand, if weary, stone building that spoke of century-old ambition, Mayor Alistair Sweetwater’s office occupied the heart of the Town Hall. The building’s exterior was blocky granite, streaked with decades of lichen and rain, but the double oak doors were polished to a warm gleam. Inside, the air changed—it was warmer, carrying the cloying scent of lemon polish overlaid on the deeper, damp-paper smell of old ledgers and forgotten files. A threadbare Axminster runner in municipal maroon led down a dim hallway lined with framed photographs of past councils, their sepia-toned faces stern and watchful.
A warm, mellifluous “Enter!” answered her knock on the door marked with a brass plaque.
Mayor Alistair Sweetwater was a man constructed to put people at ease. He rose from behind a vast, scarred oak desk—not with bureaucratic stiffness, but with the fluid grace of a seasoned host. He had a head of thick, silver-fox hair combed back from a benevolent forehead, a smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes just so, and hands that gestured with open-palmed generosity. He wore a cable-knit sweater under a tweed jacket, the picture of rustic statesmanship.
“Ms. Finch! Our new arrival. I’ve been meaning to come by and say hello. Welcome to Bitterroot.” He took her hand in both of his, his skin smooth and surprisingly soft, his grip firm and dry. The touch was prolonged, a physical assertion of welcome. “I was so sorry to hear about Arthur Crofton. A terrible accident. He was an institution. A quirky one, but an institution none the less.”

*An accident.* The word rang hollow in the plush room. Elara let her hand relax, forcing a small, polite smile. “Thank you, Mayor. It’s a beautiful town. Quiet.”

“We like it that way.” He chuckled, a rich, barrel-aged sound, and gestured for her to sit in a worn leather armchair that exhaled a soft sigh of trapped air as she settled. He retreated to his own high-backed throne. An antique, beautifully detailed map of the Sweetwater Sugar Bush hung on the wall behind him, the trees marked like regiments with neat, inked notations. “What can I do for you? Looking to open a bakery? We could use some new life, especially now. The town could stomach a good croissant.” He winked.
“Simply settling in,” she demurred, her eyes scanning the room—the orderly bookshelves, the framed award from the Vermont Maple Council, the absence of personal photographs. “Actually, I’ve been trying to get feelings of the town’s history. Arthur Crofton’s newsletter was… evocative. He mentioned the 1970s as a time of real change. A ‘fermentation,’ he called it.”

A flicker, almost imperceptible, passed behind the mayor’s eyes—a cloud shadow racing across a sunlit field, there and gone, leaving the warmth slightly diminished. He steepled his fingers, the pads pressing together thoughtfully. “The seventies. Yes. That’s when the bottom fell out of the small logging operations. The big companies moved in, regulations changed… it was a painful pivot. The Sweetwater Syrup Co. kept a lot of families afloat during that transition. My father, God rest him, believed in Bitterroot when others were packing up.” He spread his hands, a gesture of benevolent providence. “He bought up a lot of the failing timber leases, diversified. Saved the town, really.”

“That must have been difficult. A town in flux.” She leaned forward slightly, her voice a model of innocent curiosity. “Were there any… conflicts? Arthur Crofton’s writing hinted at some tensions. Between old ways and new, I mean.”

Sweetwater’s smile remained, but it tightened at the edges, pulling the skin taut over his cheekbones. “Arthur Crofton was a baker and a poet. He dealt in metaphors and wild yeast. The seventies were hard, plain and simple. People left. Those who stayed adapted.” He leaned forward now, his tone dropping to a conspiratorial warmth that like being wrapped in a smothering blanket. “Between you and me, Ms. Finch, nostalgia can rot the wood just as sure as termites. We look forward here. We’ve got a Maple Heritage Festival to plan for the fall. Big sponsor interest this year. I’d love your input, given your background. A touch of… metropolitan flair.” He said the last two words as if they were a delicate, slightly dangerous spice.
*A masterful deflection,* Elara thought. *An offer wrapped in a dismissal.* His evasion was so smooth it like hospitality. She was being gently but firmly shown the door, handed a festival pamphlet as a ticket out. She took the glossy brochure, the paper slick under her fingers. “I’ll certainly think about it. Thank you for your time, Mayor.”

“Any time, my dear. Any time.”

The heavy oak door clicked shut behind her with a sound of finality. The hallway seemed darker, colder. The eyes in the council photographs less stern and more wary. She had learned nothing, and yet everything. The past was no merely st past here; it was managed. Curated. Like a museum exhibit nobody was allowed to visit.
***

Back in Arthur Crofton’s bakery—she still thought of it as his, the ghost of his rye flour and quiet humming clinging to the bricks—the cool air held the ghostly, sour perfume of fermentation. The silence was a presence. She had taken over the space with a tenant’s tentative respect, but the soul of the place remained his. Looming in the corner like a silent monolith stood the massive starter vat, a ceramic behemoth she had scrubbed clean. It stared back at her, empty, waiting.
The clue was now a living thing in her hands, demanding action. *“Temper its warmth with the patience of winter.”* Maple syrup was boiled sap, all concentrated summer sun. Tempering required something cold, slow, a counterpoint. *“Proof it in the shadow of the crown.”* Proofing dough needed a specific, warm, humid stillness. The mayor’s office, with its old steam radiator hissing discreetly in the corner, had been exactly that—a controlled, throne-adjacent climate.
She began with the “sweetest sap.” Not just any maple syrup, but the tiny-batch, first-run golden syrup the Sweetwater family reserved for themselves and important gifts. After an hour of searching, her fingers grimy with dust, she found it: a single, unlabeled bottle forgotten on the highest shelf in the bakery’s deep pantry. It was tucked behind jars of desiccated lavender and empty canning tins. The glass was thick, the liquid inside the color of light amber, catching the weak kitchen light like captured sunshine. She uncorked it, and the aroma that wafted out was astonishing—onlyjust sweet, but complex, with notes of vanilla, cold stone, and the very essence of the maple tree itself, a scent of deep roots and April thaw.
For the tempering, she used ice-cold water drawn from the ancient hand-pump over the stone sink, water that came straight from the mountain spring and tasted of granite and eternity. She mixed it with a measure of high-protein bread flour and, her heart beating a little faster, a portion of Arthur Crofton’s own starter—revived from a crusty, desiccated scrap she’d found wedged in a crock behind the vat. She’d fed it for days, watching withhints off sacred awe as the bubbles returned, as the familiar, beer-like scent of his particular microbial colony came back to life. This was the wild yeast of Bitterroot itself.
The mixture was a shaggy, unpromising mass. She covered the bowl with a damp linen cloth, its weave coarse under her fingertips. Now, for the proof. She didn’t choose the sunniest spot or the warmest corner. Instead, she placed the bowl carefully on the worn wooden counter directly beneath the old wall vent. She’d noticed it before—a wrought-iron grille that seemed decorative. But resting her hand near it, she faint, consistent breath of warm, dry air. It shared a wall with the Town Hall’s boiler room. *In the shadow of the crown.*

For twelve hours, she did nothing but wait. This was the patience of winter. She cleaned, she read, she walked through the misty town, but her mind was in the kitchen, with the silent, alchemical work happening under the cloth. When she finally peeled back the linen, the dough had risen, not with a violent puffiness, but with a slow, confident swell. It had a subtle, tangy aroma beneath the profound sweetness of the maple, a smell that was somehow both wholesome and secretive. She folded it, her hands learning its texture—the gluten developing into a strong, living network, a town map of connections and tensions. The dough was cool and firm, yet yielding, like a relaxed muscle.
Baking it in the predawn, the old brick oven threw a wave of heat that pushed back the kitchen’s chill and made the copper pots gleam. The loaf transformed in the fierce, dry heat. It emerged not just brown, but a deep, burnished gold, its crust crackled and shimmering with a sticky, maple-flecked glaze she’d brushed on in the final minutes. It sat on the cooling rack, radiating a warmth that smelled of caramelized sugar and earth. She tapped its bottom. The sound was a perfect, low, hollow song. Slicing into the still-warm heel required a serrated knife sawing through the tough, glossy crust. The interior revealed was a masterpiece: an open, honeycombed crumb the color of old ivory, streaked with veins of molten gold where the syrup had woven itself into the very structure. The taste, when she finally brought a small piece to her lips, was extraordinary. The deep, woody sweetness of maple hit first, then folded smoothly into the primal, satisfying tang of the sourdough, finishing with a clean, almost flinty note from the mountain water. This was simplyjust bread; it was a portrait of Bitterroot in edible form—sweet and sour, gilded and earthy, transparent and deeply complex.
***

She didn’t announce anything. She simply took the loaf, still warm and wrapped in a rough linen cloth that smelled of flour and cedar, to the Grange Hall that evening. A casual potluck to “celebrate Arthur Crofton’s memory” was petering out into a few lingering souls. The hall was a cavern of shadows beyond the pool of light from wrought-iron pendant lamps. The air was thick with the smell of slow-cooked baked beans, woodsmoke from the fieldstone fireplace, and the faint, sweet-sour tang of apple cider vinegar on cleaned plates. Low murmurs of conversation echoed in the high rafters.
Elara placed the bread on the scarred trestle table with a quiet, “I made this. From an old idea of Arthur Crofton’s, I think.”

The statement landed in a lull. Heads turned. The crust gleamed under the lights like a treasure. Mabel from the post office, her fingers knotted with arthritis, was the first to approach. She didn’t speak, just picked up the bread knife and sawed off a careful slice. The sound of the crust cracking was loud in the quiet room. She examined the crumb, her eyes narrowing, then took a bite. She chewed slowly, her gaze turning inward, losing focus on the present.
Bert from the hardware store followed, then old Missy Peabody who taught piano, then Frank the retired mechanic, his hands black with grease that never quite washed out. Soon, the loaf was half gone. Elara watched, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. She wa merely t just feeding them; she was casting a weighted line into the deep, still waters of the past, waiting for a tug.
The reaction was a slow, unsettling bloom. People didn’t compliment her. They fell silent, their eyes distant, their jaws working thoughtfully as if deciphering a flavor-text from their youth. It was Mabel who finally spoke, her voice soft and frayed at the edges. “Tastes like the old sugar shack. Before the large evaporators. When the steam would fog the windows so thick you couldn’t see out, and old man Silas Sweetwater—Alistair’s grandfather—would give us kids a spoonful of hot syrup on the snow. It would harden into a kind of… glass candy. Tasted like this. Pure. Before it got… complicated.”

A murmur of agreement rippled through the listeners. It was then that the mountain in the corner shifted. Gus Henderson heaved himself up from his chair. A retired logger, he was a monument of a man being slowly eroded by time and a bottomless well of cheap whiskey. His plaid shirt strained over his barrel chest, and his face was a topographical map of hard living—ravines of wrinkles, scars like fault lines. He swayed slightly, the floorboards groaning under his weight, and pointed a thick, calloused finger at the remaining bread.
“That,” he slurred, his voice a rockslide of gravel and phlegm, “tastes like the *deal*.”

The room went preternaturally still. The gentle clatter of a plate being stacked ceased mid-motion.
“Gus, now,” Mabel said, a sharp, warning note in her voice, the kind used on children and sleeping dogs.
But the flavor had unlocked a vault. The bread and the whiskey were a potent skeleton key. He lumbered forward, his boots thudding heavily. He tore off a hunk of bread, crust and all, and shoved it into his mouth. He chegged, his jaw working side to side, his red-rimmed eyes staring at something forty-five years gone. “The sweet deal. The Sweetwater deal. ‘Seventy-eight.” He took a long, desperate swig from a flask he pulled from his pocket, the liquid glugging. “Promised us the world. Gold in them trees. Jobs for the boys. ‘Modernization.’ ‘Efficiency.’” He spat the words like bad nuts. “My boy, Robbie… he was sixteen. Strong as an ox. He was gonna run a skidder for ‘em. Had the promise in writing.” Gus’s voice cracked, a sound of splintering heartwood. He looked around, seeming to realize the faces staring back at him, but the floodgate was open and the torrent couldn’t be stopped. “Then it all went sour. Real sour. The promises dried up faster than a summer creek. The jobs headed to outsiders with machines. And that city kid… the one asking all the questions.”

Elara’s gasped. She didn’t move a muscle.
“Pretty boy with a notebook,” Gus continued, his voice dropping to a haunted whisper that forced everyone to lean in. “Stayed at the old boarding house. Ate at the diner, asked about timber rights, union talks, land deeds. Nice kid. Curious. Then he was just… gone. Like a puff of smoke off the ridge. They replied he received restless. Said he hitched out on the dawn truck. But his notebook was left in his room. Under the mattress. I was doing some repairs… I seen it.”

The silence in the Grange was absolute, a physical weight pressing down on everyone.
“What city kid, Gus?” Elara asked, her own voice barely a whisper, yet it appeared to boom in the quiet.
Gus’s bleary eyes swam into focus on her. For a second, she saw raw, unvarnished fear break through the alcoholic haze—the fear of a man who’d remembered something he’d spent decades trying to fOnlyt. “Just a kid. Didn’t know nothing. And then we wasn’t allowed to know nothing neither. ‘For the good of the town,’ th answered. ‘Sweet deal gone sour.’” He repeated the phrase like a grim, worn-out mantra. Then, as if the memory had burned him, he turned and shambled toward the door, his broad shoulders hunched against the weight of the stares. The screen door slapped shut behind him with a sound like a gunshot in the stillness.
The spell shattered. People move with sudden, jerky efficiency, avoiding each other’s eyes. Plates were cleared with a clatter that was too loud. Conversations resumed in hushed, deliberate tones about the unseasonable chill, about the price of feed, about anything but the past. Elara was an outsider again, but now she was an outsider who had dropped a stone into a still pond and murky, long-buried things stir in the depths.
She was gathering the linen cloth, the remaining heel of bread now feeling like evidence, when a shadow fell across the table, blocking the light from the pendant lamp. Sheriff Lorne stood there, his broad frame imposing. She hadn’t seen him arrive. He hadn’t touched the bread. His hands were hooked in his belt, his thumbs resting near his badge and his sidearm.
“Ms. Finch,” he said, his voice low and gravelly, worn smooth by years of quiet authority and, perhaps, suppressed frustration. He took off his wide-brimmed hat, running a hand over his short-cropped, gunmetal-gray hair. “That was quite a loaf.”

“Thank you, Sheriff.” She met his gaze, forcing her hands to be still.
“It got people talking.” He paused, choosing his words with the care of a man disarming a trap. “About things that are best left settled. Gus Henderson… he’s a excellent man. But he’s lived with a lot of pain for a long time. Pain and whiskey are poor historians.”

“Is it settled?” she asked, holding his steely blue eyes. “If a boy went missing in ‘78? That’s not history; that’s a cold case.”

His jaw tightened, a slittlemuscle twitching near his ear. “Missing persons reports from forty-odd years ago are ice-cold trails, Ms. Finch. People leave. Especially outsiders. They get restless, they get ideas, they move on. It’s not a mystery, it’s a fact of life up here. We don’t have the manpower for archaeology.”

“Guto think there was more to it. A notebook left behind.”

“Gus Henderson,” the smurmuredff said, his tone dropping, becoming almost paternal, yet no less firm, “has been pickling his liver and his memories since before you were born. He lost his son to a logging accident in ‘79. He blames the world. He blames the Sweetwaters. He needs a ghost to haunt.” He put his hat back on, the gesture final. “Elara—can I call you Elara? This is a good town. We’ve had our sorrows, like any place. But we look after our own. We have to. Arthur Crofton’s death was a tragedy. An accident. Baking bread is a fine thing. A noble object.” He leaned in slightly, and she caught the scent of coffee and wintergreen on his breath. “But digging up the past… that’s not baking. That’s grave-robbing. It stirs up pain for folks who’ve learned to live with it. It breaks the peace. My job is to keep the peace.” He held her gaze for a long, heavy moment. “My advice? Make your pastries. Enjoy the mountain air. Stop stirring the pot.”

He gave her a firm, meaningful nod that less like advice and more like an order, then turned and walked away, his boots echoing on the wooden floor. It wasn’t a threat; it was a plea from a man who genuinely believed he was protecting something fragile. That chilled her more than outright hostility would have. A threat you could fight. A plea for complicit silence was a cage.
***

That night, the mist returned with a vengeance, coiling around her cabin like a living, breathing entity. The memory of the bread’s transformative flavor—the sweet maple promise and the deep, resilient sour of truth—warred with the phantom sound of Gus’s shattered voice and the sheriff’s quiet, potent warning. She lay awake on the narrow bed, the rough wool blankets scratchy against her skin, listening to the absolute silence of the mountains. It was a silence that had once like peace but now like a held breath, the quiet of a room where everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop.
It dropped just after 2 a.m.
The sound was so alien it took her a moment to place it: sirens. Not the lone wail of an ambulance heading for the highway, but the frantic, overlapping yelps of multiple cruisers converging. In Bitterroot, it was a sound of apocalyptic disruption. Her heart leapt into her throat. She was at the window in an instant, pushing aside the gingham curtain.
Outside, the world was a study in monochrome and panic. The mist glowed, pulsed with the rhythmic, hellish strobe of red and blue. The lights converged not on the woods or the highway, but in the extremely heart of town, painting the swirling vapor in carnival colors of alarm. They were focused on the small, quaint stone building of the Bitterroot Historical Society. Its single, arched oak door stood wide open, a black maw in the pale granite.
Pulling on boots and a heavy coat over her nightclothes, Elara ran out into the damp cold. The gravel of the lane bit through her thin soles. A tiny crowd of four or five had gathered at a respectful distance, silhouettes in the chaotic light. She joined them, her breath pluming in the frigid air. Mabel was there, clutching a faded robe around herself, her fsimplynot just ashen but deeply frightened.
“What happened?” Elara asked, her voice hushed.
“Break-in,” Mabel whispered, not taking her eyes off the gaping doorway. “Sometime after midnight. Millie Jenkins, who lives next door, heard glass breaking—not a smash, she said, a careful, *specific* crack. She called the sheriff.”

As if on cue, Sheriff Lorne emerged from the building. His flashlight beam was a solid, angry blade cutting through the decorative mist. He spoke to Deputy Colson, his words sharp and clipped, lost to the onlookers but his posture screaming tension—shoulders rigid, one hand on his hip near his gun. He turned, scanning the scene, and his gaze swept over the compact cluster of onlookers. It stopped on Elara. In the strobing emergency lights, his expression was a flickering montage: anger, frustration, and a profound, weary suspicion that landed on her like a physical weight. He held her eyes for a three-count that like an hour, then turned sharply back to his deputy.
Deputy Colson, looking young and out of his depth, jogged over to them. “Nothing to see, folks. Go on home. It’s cold, and wobtainede got it handled.”

“What did they take, Danny?” Bert asked, his voice rough with sleep and concern. “Vandalism?”

Colson shifted his weight, his eyes darting back toward the sheriff. “Just… some old papers, looks like. Made a bit of a mess. Nothing valuable. Please, folks, go on back to bed.”

As the small, shocked grouto disperse, Mabel lingered. She touched Elara’s arm, her fingers cold and brittle as twigs. She leaned in so close Elara could smell the lavender talcum powder on her skin. “Millie told me,” she breathed, her voice the dry, terrified rustle of a last autumn leaf clinging to a branch. “Before the sheriff shushed herwhisperedd. She said they didn’t make a mess. Not really. They were… surgicalTravelednt straight to the archive boxes in the back room. Ignored the donation case with the old muskets. Ignored the cash box for the donation fee.” Mabel’s old, frightened eyes locked onto Elara’s. The warm, culinary mystery of the day had frozen over completely, revealing something sharp and deadly beneath the ice.
“They only took one thing, Elara.” The use of her first name was a bond, a passing of a terrible torch.
Elara’s mouth went dry. “What?”

Mabel’s whisper was barely audible, swallowed by the mist and the dying sirens.
“They only took the records for 1978.”
