**Chapter 4: A Sticky, Burnt Secret**

The rain in Bitterroot was relentless, seeping into Elara Finch's coat and eroding her resolve. It painted the world in shades of gray, from the bruised sky to the slick mountains, and turned the vibrant foliage into a sodden, brown mess. She stood under the dripping eaves of Finch & Flour, the sound of rain hitting a galvanized bucket a maddening beat. The unpaved street had become a slick, ochre mess, sucking greedily at the boots of passersby. The town like a faded photograph, all muted greens and blurred edges. The smell was a potent mix of wet earth, decaying leaves, and pine sap – a scent that clung to her like a damp shroud, weighing her down with every breath. Beneath it, a ghost of woodsmoke lingered, a mournful echo of warmth.
She was waiting for Leo Arthur Crofton, and the waiting was torture. Every droplet hitting the puddle at her feet sounded like a ticking clock, counting down the seconds since Mabel's terrified whisper. *They only took the records for 1978.* The year hung in her mind, a dark, solitary digit burning against the fog. What catastrophe, what sin, was buried in that specific slice of time? Her fingers worried at a loose thread in the lining of her pocket. The chill was insidious, creeping past her collar and settling at the base of her spine, a constant reminder of her own trespass. She was about to invade a dead man's sanctuary, armed with nothing but a gut feeling and a name passed in the dark.
He arrived, a broad-shouldered silhouette materializing from the fog. He wore a waxed canvas jacket darkened by the rain, and his expression was pragmatic and unyielding, like his heavy-duty boots squelching in the mud. No trace of his uncle's whimsy remained in his jaw. The rain beaded on his jacket and clung to his dark hair, making it stick to his forehead in damp strands. He looked like a part of the landscape – rooted, weathered, and skeptical of anything that didn't yield a tangible harvest.
"You're sure about this?" he asked, dispensing with hello. His voice was a low rumble, like distant thunder trapped under the ridge. It vibrated through her chest, making her breath catch.
