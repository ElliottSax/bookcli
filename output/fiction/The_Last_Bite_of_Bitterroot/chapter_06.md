Chapter 6: Dam Water and Sourdough

The rain began as Elara Finch left the library, a fine, persistent mist that seemed less to fall from the sky than to condense from the very air of Bitterroot Valley. It beaded on the wool of her sweater and silvered the dark branches of the pines that crowded the road leading west out of town, toward the dam. The ledger, wrapped in a plastic bag and tucked under her arm, felt like a live thing, a cold ember of the past she was carrying into the damp present. Every drop of rain merged with the one before it, creating a soothing melody, a sullen beat that gradually swallowed every sound except the hum of rain on asphalt.
The entries they’d deciphered were sparse, chilling in their bureaucratic blandness. Dates in the summer and fall of 1978. Initials: ‘J.H.’, ‘M.S.’, ‘C.C.’—the latter, Leo confirmed with a grimace, likely his great-uncle, Arthur Crofton. And amounts, not huge but significant for a struggling valley. The description column held the code: ‘H-78 Final Harvest Compensation.’ The ‘H’ was circled in the same frantic ink as the note in the cookbook.
“Huckle,” Leo had said, staring at the page in the low light of his farm supply store office. The scent of fertilizer and burlap was a strange counterpoint to the historical poison they were uncovering. “Got to be. The Huckles had the biggest spread up the west fork. Or… they did.”

The west fork was now under sixty feet of water. The thought echoed through Elara Finch, raising a desolate frown on her face. She shiver that had nothing to do with the cool rain. The Bitterroot Reservoir was a slick, steel-gray plate set into the crook of the mountains. The dam itself was a curved wedge of concrete, moss-stained and weeping from a thousand tiny seams. It hummed, a low, sub-auditory vibration Elara Finch in her molars. The manager’s office was a concrete block cube clinging to the canyon wall beside it. A sign on the heavy metal door read: W. Griggs, Reservoir Manager. No Admittance Without Appointment.
Elara Finch hadn’t called.
Wendell Griggs was a man shaped by wind and silence. Gaunt, with skin like cured leather and eyes the color of the reservoir’s deep water, he stood in his doorway, blocking any view of the interior. The smell of strong coffee and old motor oil wafted out. A silver-rimmed watch gleamed on his left wrist, turned inward against the cool rain.
“Mr. Griggs? Elara Finch. I’m—”

“I know who you are.” His voice was a gravel scrape. “The baker with questions.”

“I was hoping to talk about the reservoir. About 1978.”

His expression didn’t change. “Nothing to talk about. It holds water. It generates a trickle of power. It’s a dam.”

“There were homesteads here,” she pressed, the mist clinging to her eyelashes. “The Huckle place.”

A shutter came down behind his eyes. “Before my time. I read the reports. All voluntary buyouts. Eminent domain. Progress.”

“A boy went missing that year. Sam Huckle.”

Griggs took a slow sip from a chipped enamel mug, his eyes avoiding hers. “Tragedy. Kids drown. Especially in new reservoirs. Hidden snags, cold water. Makes ’em panic.”

“Was his body ever found?”

The door frame cast an uneven shadow across his face. “The water doesn’t give up all its secrets, Ms. Finch. And I don’t give out interviews.” He close the door. “Go bake your bread. Leave the deep water to those who understand its moods.”

The door clicked shut, the finality of the sound swallowed by the omnipresent hum. Elara Finch stood there, the damp seeping through her shoes. Griggs hadn’t asked why she was there. He’d already known. Someone had talked. The thought was a new chill, separate from the mountain mist.
As she stood there, lost in thought, rain seeped into the leather of her jacket, seeped into her bones, the chill reaching out to take hold of her. The memories lingered, though, as always they did. She couldn't shake them off, but neither could she make sense of them.
The code from the cookbook haunted her. ‘For the soaked days. For the water-risen. A porridge loaf, to fill the hollows.’ It was a recipe for hardship, for using the dregs, the leftovers, the last scraps before a winter flood or a failed crop. It like an answer to Griggs’s deep water, a way to touch the past not through confrontation, but through sustenance.
Back in her cabin’s kitchen, with the ledger open on the flour-dusted table, she began. The recipe was simple, austere. Coarse rye flour, a handful of rolled oats, a pinch of salt. No yeast. The leavening was a ‘sourdough porridge’—a scoop of her own vigorous starter stirred into simmering water and oats until it thickened into a gruel. The smell was primal, earthy, like wet grain and hot stone.
As she mixed the thick, sticky dough - more a batter, really - she thought of a woman in a kitchen not unlike this one, seventy years ago, looking out at a rising creek. She thought of Sam Huckle’s mother, maybe using this very recipe in the autumn of 1978, the waters of the new reservoir already creeping up the road toward her door. To fill the hollows. What hollows had that flood created?
The bitterness of the coffee beans filled the room, mingling with the coarse taste of the flour. Every grain, every crystal of salt was heavy with memory, born from the same earth that the Huckles once worked. And what of the women? The wives of the homesteaders? Were they given the same honor, the same importance as their husbands? The taste of the dough informed by pain, shaped by the unknown or the unspeakable.
She baked it in a scalded cast-iron pot. The loaf that emerged was dense, dark, with a crust like riverbed clay. It sang a low, hollow note when tapped. She broke a piece. The crumb was moist, close-grained, faintly tart. It tasted of patience, of scarcity, of making do. It was the antithesis of Mayor Sweetwater’s golden, syrupy luxury. This was the bread of the drowned.
She was wiping her hands, the taste of rye and time still on her tongue, when her phone buzzed with an unknown local number. A text, brief and to the point: ‘Ask Boyd Jensen about the Huckle survey. He’s at 37 Aspen Lane. He’s waiting.’

Her heart thumped against her ribs. Anonymous. It could be a trap. But Leo was in the valley, checking on a shipment. She was alone with her bread and her ghosts. She pocketed a serrated knife, feeling foolish and fierce, and drove back into town.
Boyd Jensen lived in a small, neat bungalow on the older side of Bitterroot. A retired surveyor’s tripod stood on the porch, holding a hanging basket of dead petunias. He answered her knock immediately, as if he’d been standing at the window. He was a small man, bent like a question mark, with bright, bird-like eyes behind thick glasses.
“You're Elara Finch,” he said, not asking. “Come in. I made tea.”

His living room was a museum of maps. Topographical sheets were pinned to walls, rolled in cylinders, spread under the glass of his coffee table. The valley, in all its incarnations. The air smelled of paper, ink, and peppermint tea.
“You got my message,” he replied, handing her a delicate china cup.
“Was it you?”

Boyd Jensen gestured to a faded color photograph pinned to the wall. A sketch map of the Huckle homestead. The creek running through the property, its bends so drawn they appeared to pulse with a life of their own.
‘Those were almost ready to give up the survey plan,’ he gestured, pointing at a vector drawing of numerous radial beams slammed out to sea him guessed.
