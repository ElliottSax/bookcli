 dark, the scent of old bread and dust thick in the air. The shelves were bare, the ovens cold, and the countertops empty. The only sound was the faint hum of the refrigerator in the back, a low, steady drone that seemed to echo in the empty space.

Elara Finch's eyes scanned the room, taking in every detail. The flour-dusted countertops, the empty shelves, the cold ovens. It was as if the bakery had been abandoned, left to the mercy of time. The air was thick with the scent of old bread, a reminder of the past, of the lives that had once filled this space.

She walked over to the ovens, her fingers tracing the edges of the cold metal. The ovens were old, their surfaces pitted and worn, but they were clean, as if they had been recently wiped down. Elara Finch's eyes narrowed as she examined the controls, her fingers deftly adjusting the settings. The ovens were set to a low temperature, just enough to keep the dough warm, but not enough to bake it.

A noise from the back of the bakery caught her attention. A soft, almost imperceptible rustling, like the sound of paper being moved. Elara Finch's heart pounded in her chest as she slowly made her way toward the sound. The back room was dark, the only light coming from a small window high up on the wall. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and dust, the shelves lined with boxes and binders, their contents hidden in the shadows.

Elara Finch's eyes scanned the room, her fingers brushing against the spines of the binders. They were old, their covers worn and faded, but they were neatly arranged, as if someone had been here recently. She pulled one out, her fingers tracing the embossed letters on the cover. "Bitterroot Bakery, 1892-1905." The pages inside were filled with handwritten notes, recipes, and sketches, proof of the bakery's history.

As she flipped through the pages, a small envelope fell out, its edges yellowed with age. Elara Finch's heart skipped a beat as she picked it up, her fingers trembling as she opened it. Inside was a single sheet of paper, the handwriting familiar and yet foreign, as if it belonged to a ghost.

"To my dearest Elara Finch, I have made a terrible mistake. I thought I was protecting you, but I have only brought you into danger. The truth is, the Wild Loaf is not just a recipe, it is a key. A key to something far more dangerous than I ever imagined. I must leave, but I cannot take the truth with me. I have hidden it where only you will find it. Look to the heart of the loaf, and you will find the truth. I am sorry, my dear. I only wanted to keep you safe. - Arthur Crofton"

Elara Finch's hands trembled as she read the letter, her mind racing with questions. What had Arthur Crofton been hiding? What was the truth he was so desperate to protect her from? And why had he left her to find it on her own?

She looked up, her eyes scanning the room, searching for any clue that might lead her to the truth. The shelves were lined with boxes and binders, their contents hidden in the shadows. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and dust, the only sound the faint hum of the refrigerator in the back.
