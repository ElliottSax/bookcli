Chapter 12: The Last Bite The scent of old yeast and older fear hung in the air of The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate like a shroud, a constant reminder of The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate's ruined heart. Elara Finch stood in the doorway, the dusty, flour-dusted workbenches and the gaping maw of the brick oven stretching before her like a skeletal hand. Moonlight, thin and milky, filtered through the grime-caked windows, casting an eerie glow on the scene. Her hunch had been a physical pull, a cord tied behind her navel, dragging her from the chaos of the sabotaged festival tent, past the blinking lights of the sheriff's cruiser, and back here. To where it all began. The air inside The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate was heavy with the weight of unspoken words, the silence between Elara Finch and Maureen a palpable thing that appeared to vibrate with tension. Elara Finch's eyes locked onto Maureen's, searching for a glimmer of the woman she once knew, the woman who had been a friend, a confidante, and a fellow baker. But Maureen's face was a mask of weary resignation, her eyes sunken and her skin pale. The faint scent of lavender wafted from her hair, a reminder of the perfume she used to wear, a fragrance that had always brought feelings of calm to The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate. “You found it,” Elara Finch said, her voice barely disturbing the thick silence. The words like a betrayal, a reminder that the past was finally catching up with them. She took a step forward, her boots crunching on the gritty texture of spilled flour and plaster. The sound was like a crack in the silence, a small, jarring reminder that the world outside these walls still existed. Maureen didn't startle. She turned slowly, her face a mask of weary resignation. The crock was a dark, squat shape in her hands. “It needed to be fed,” she said, as if explaining something simple to a child. The words were laced with a deep sadness,hints off loss thato echo through The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate. Elara Finch's eyes followed the movement of Maureen's hands, tracing the lines of her fingers as they cradled the crock. The gesture was almost tender, a reminder of the countless hours they had spent together, baking and laughing, their hands moving in perfect sync. “You killed him,” Elara Finch replied. It wasn't a question. The words like a weight, a crushing burden that seemed to down on her chest. She remembered the day Arthur Crofton died, the look of shock on his face, the sound of his wife's screams. It had been a sound that had haunted her ever since, a reminder of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface of their small town. The memory was like a cold draft, a chill that ran down her spine as she gazed at Maureen. A long sigh escaped Maureen, a sound that seemeate her entire frame. She set the crock gently on the workbench, her fingers lingering on its cool glaze. The movement was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to make Elara Finch's heart ache. She remembered the countless hours they had spent together, baking and laughing, their hands moving in perfect sync. It was a memory that seemed to beloappeared tother lifetime, a lifetime that was now lost forever. The air inside The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate was thick with the scent of old bread and stale air. Elara Finch's nostrils flared, and she pang of nostalgia wash over her. She remembered the smell of fresh dough, the way it filled The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate and made her feel alive. But that was before the festival, before the chaos, before the darkness that had consumed their town. “He was going to tell everything,” Maureen said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Not just about the boy, Peter. All of it. My father's deal, the bribes, the lies. The great 'rescue' that made him mayor and made this town a prison of secrets.” She looked around the ruined bakery, her eyes glistening with tears. “answeredaid the guilt was rotting him from the inside out, worse than any sourdough hooch. He was going to write it all into that final recipe book. A confession baked into a bâtard.” Elara Finch took a careful step forward, her boots crunching on the gritty texture of spilled flour and plaster. The sound was like a crack in the silence, a tiny, jarring reminder that the world outside these walls still existed. She shiver run down her spine as she gazed at Maureen, her eyes searching for a glimmer of the woman she once knew. “So you argued,” Elara Finch said, her voice barely above a whisper. The words like a betrayal, a reminder that the past was finally catching up with them. “Here.” “He was so calm,” Maureen whispered, her voice gaining a sharp, fractured edge. The words were laced with a deep sadness, aloss that seemed to ech The bakery with its old brick oventhe estatmurmuredHe said it was time the town tasted its own history, no matter how bitter. I begged him. My father was dying, his legacy... my family's name... this town... it would have crumbled to nothing. But Arthur Crofton just kept talking about transparency, about how a starter needs air to thrive, not to be sealed in the dark.” Her hand clenched into a fist on the bench. “He turned his back on me. Went to pull his precious starter from the fridge. And I saw the rolling pin. It was simply... there.” The image bloomed in Elara Finch's mind, vivid and horrifying: the heavy maple cylinder, a tool of creation, lifted in a moment of perfect, preserving fury. The thud would have been a soft, final punctuation in the dough-scented air. She wave of nausea wash over her, a reminder of the violence that lay at the heart of their small town. The memory was like a cold draft, a chill that ran down her spine as she gazed at Maureen. “You staged the robbery,” Elara Finch said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Took the cash box, the petty things. But you took the crock, too. Why?” Maureen's chin trembled. She looked from the sheriff to Elara Finch, to Leo now visible by the door, his face pale and set. The last vestige of fight left her. It didn't dissolve into tears, but into a profound, crumbling exhaustion. She glanced down at the crock. “He named it Arthur Crofton, you whispered,” she said, her voice flat. “After himself. The ultimate vanity. A living monument.” She lifted it, not in threat, but in offering, toward Elara Finch. “It's hungry.” Elara Finch crossed the space and took the heavy crock. The ceramic was cold, but she imagined she could feel a faint, persistent warmth at its core, the slow, anaerobic breath of decades. She pried off the lid. The smell was profound—a deep, acidic, fruity tang, like apples and earth and time itself. The starter was healthy, a bubbly, beige-gray expanse with a thin layer of golden hooch on top. Alive. As she gazed at the starter, Elara Finch feelings ofh over her. She remembered the countless hours she had spent with Maureen, baking and laughing, their hands moving in perfect sync. The memory was like a warm hug, a reminder of the joy and love that had once filled The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate. But it was also a reminder of the darkness that had consumed their town, the secrets that had been hidden beneath the surface. She looked up at Maureen, her eyes searching for a glimmer of the woman she once knew. But Maureen's face was a mask of weary resignation, her eyes sunken and her skin pale.

Elara Finch's eyes dropped back to the starter, her mind racing with questions. Why had Maureen taken the crock? What had she hoped to achieve by leaving it here? And what did the starter mean, really? Was it just a symbol of the past, or was it something more? As she gazed at the starter, Elara Finch w over her.

She remembered the countless hours spent with Maureen, baking and laughing, their hands moving in perfect sync. That memory was not a ghost; it was a foundation.
She looked up again, past the weariness on Maureen’s face, and saw the faintest flicker in her sunken eyes—not of the woman she once knew, but of the woman who had survived. The lavender scent was not just a relic; it was a thread, still connecting them.
“It’s onlyjust a symbol, is it?” Elara Finch said softly, her voice steady. “It’s an ingredient.”

Maureen’s mask softened. A single tear traced a path through the dust on her cheek. “It needs to be fed,” she whispered. “It needs care. I… I forgot how.”

Elara Finch understood then. Maureen hadn’t stolen the past; she had returned it, hoping someone remembered how to tend it. The darkness had consumed much, but some roots remained, waiting for light.
“We can feed istatedElara Finch said, stepping forward. She placed a hand over Maureen’s where it rested on the cool crock. “Together.”

The silence that followed was no longer hollow. It was the quiet of a held breath, of a first step. Outside, the first hint of dawn brushed The bakery with its old brick oventhe estate windows. They would bake again. The bread would not erase the secrets, but it would fill the empty spaces with warmth and the enduring, yeasty smell of hope. It was a start.
