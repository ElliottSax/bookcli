Chapter 4: Roots in the Blood

Chapter 4: Roots in the Blood

The soil of Hollow Oak was in Elara’s blood. She knew it now, not as a metaphor, but as a grim, physiological fact. The morning after discovering the first lesion—a rough, bark-like patch on her left calf—she found another. This one was a small, weeping circle on her right palm, the skin around it stained a faint, loamy brown. It smelled not of infection, but of damp earth and rotting leaves. When she pressed it, a single grain of black sand, too perfectly round to be natural, emerged. The pain was not sharp; it was a deep, throbbing ache, as if the wound went all the way to the bone and was packed with cold mud.

The blight in the town park had spread. The circle of dead grass was now ten feet across, and the oak at its center wept a viscous, amber sap from a crack in its trunk. Elara stood before it, her own palm throbbing in sympathy. She held her hand up, comparing. The patterns in the bark of the crack mirrored the broken capillaries around her lesion. A connection, direct and horrifying, was being sewn between her flesh and the failing land.

The Hollow Oak Historical Society was a tomb of paper and dust, a one-room annex attached to the town’s skeletal library. Elara had taken to arriving before dawn, her movements furtive, driven by a need she couldn’t name. The polite fiction of her job—curating exhibits on quilting bees and the founding of the grange—had been abandoned. Now, she hunted.

The records were a chaotic mess, a testament to generations of haphazard filing. She found property ledgers, birth and death certificates scrawled in spidery ink, minutes from town council meetings debating the price of cider. And then, tucked behind a moldering ledger labeled “Seed Purchases, 1887-1891,” she found the first fragment.

It was a single sheet, brittle as a dried leaf. The heading read, simply, “Account of The Giving.” The script was tight, economical.

“October 27th, 1891. The yield is ash in the mouth. The corn is stunted, the apples bitter with rot. The Committee has met. The Offering has been selected. It is agreed: the Soil-Soaked Sacrifice must be made before the last leaf falls. The Heart-Oak hungers. We must feed the roots, or be consumed by them.”

Elara’s breath fogged in the cold air of the room. Soil-Soaked Sacrifice. Heart-Oak. The words resonated in the hollow of her chest. She thought of the massive, gnarled oak in the center of the town square, the one from which Hollow Oak took its name. Its roots were said to run under every major street.

Her search became frantic, her fingers leaving smudges of her own earthy discharge on the pages. She found oblique references in financial records: “Payment to J. Harlow for silence, re: the Harvest.” “Timber for the pyre, Last Harvest.” The word “Harvest” was never capitalized in the old documents except in this specific, terrifying context.

The migraines returned, not as sudden blows, but as a constant, low-pressure presence behind her eyes, smelling of ozone and turned earth. The soil under her fingernails was perpetual now, no matter how fiercely she scrubbed. It was as if her body was slowly transmuting into the stuff of the blighted town.

A week after finding the first fragment, the need for air, for proof that the world outside the records room still functioned, drove her out. She walked, her feet carrying her without conscious direction away from the quaint main street, past the last white picket fences, and into the rolling farmland that cradled the town.

Here, the decay was not picturesque. It was economic, desperate. She saw fields where the corn stood grey and shriveled, like old men’s fingers clutching at a dead sky. Orchards where the branches were skeletal, fruit mummified on the bough. The air here didn’t smell of rich loam, but of vinegar and defeat.

She was standing at a rusted gate, staring at a field of withered soybean plants, when a voice spoke behind her.

“Ain’t a pretty sight, is it?”

She turned, startled. A man in his late forties stood there, his face leathered by sun and wind, his eyes a faded blue. He wore worn coveralls and an expression of profound weariness. He wasn’t handsome, but there was a solidity to him, like a fence post that had weathered a hundred storms.

“No,” Elara said, her voice raspy from disuse. “It’s not.”

“Liam Cauley,” he said, nodding toward the field. “This is what’s left of mine.”

“Elara Vance. I’m… at the historical society.”

A faint, humorless smile touched his lips. “Diggin’ up our glorious past? Might find more life in those old books than out here.”

“What happened?” she asked, gesturing to the field.

“What always happens,” Liam sighed, unlatching the gate. “Come on, if you want a closer look. Just don’t breathe too deep.”

She followed him into the field. Up close, the blight was more sinister. The plants weren’t just dead; they were wrong. The stems were twisted into spirals, the leaves curled into tight, blackened fists. She crouched, against her better judgment, and touched the soil. It was cold and granular, like ash. And there, amidst the grey, were tiny, pearl-like nodules. They looked exactly like the thing that had come out of her palm.

“It’s in the ground,” Liam said, watching her. “Sucks the life right out. Tried everything. Different rotations, new seed, more fertilizer, less fertilizer. It’s like the land itself just… quit. Or got poisoned.” He kicked a clump of dead soybeans. “My granddad said his granddad talked about a bad time like this. Called it ‘the land going fallow in its soul.’ Superstitious nonsense, I thought.”

Elara straightened, wiping her hand on her trousers. “What did they do about it? Back then?”

Liam looked at her, his gaze sharpening. “Why? You find something in those books of yours?”

She hesitated, the words Soil-Soaked Sacrifice clotting in her throat. “Just curious. Patterns. History repeating.”

He studied her for a long moment, then shrugged. “Stories. Always just stories. About a bargain. A trade.” He looked out over his dead field, his jaw tight. “Sometimes, when I’m out here at dusk, I swear I can feel it. Not just dead, but… hungry. Sounds crazy.”

“It doesn’t,” Elara whispered, her palm searing with a fresh pulse of pain.

He offered her a grudging tour of his farm, pointing out the failing well, the listless livestock. His skepticism was a brittle shell over a deep well of fear. He was a man of science, of tractors and soil pH, watching his world be unmade by something no agricultural extension agent could diagnose. As they walked back to the gate, he paused.

“You got people here? Family?”

“No. Just me.”

He nodded, as if that confirmed something. “Be careful what you dig up, Ms. Vance. In my experience, some things are buried because they need to stay that way. The soil in Hollow Oak… it has a long memory.”

His words followed her back to the historical society, colder than the autumn wind.
That night, in the silent, oppressive dark of her rented room, the pull was irresistible. She returned to the annex, guided by a compulsion that felt like roots growing in her mind. She bypassed the town records entirely and went to the oldest section, a collection of personal effects donated by long-dead families. Trunks of moth-eaten clothes, boxes of china, and, in a heavy oak chest banded with iron, she found the journals.

The one that called to her was bound in water-stained leather, the pages thick and yellowed. The name on the flyleaf was “Alistair Finch.” The first entries were mundane: weather reports, notes on sheep prices, the marriage of a daughter. Then, in the autumn of 1891, the tone changed.

“October 15th: The blight is upon us. Not a pestilence of insect or fungus, but a withering from within. The very sap of the trees runs black. Jeremiah’s boy cut his foot on a plowshare, and the wound festered with a black grain, like cursed sand. The old ones whisper of the Heart-Oak. They say it is the anchor of the valley’s soul, and its soul is sick.”

Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs. She read on, her eyes devouring the cramped script.

“October 28th: The Committee has made its decision. The ritual of the Last Harvest must be observed. A volunteer, one of pure heart and deep connection to the land, must bind themselves to the Heart-Oak on the night of the final moon before Samhain. They will take the sickness of the land into their own body, a vessel for the poison. The land will be cleansed through their sacrifice. It is called ‘The Giving.’ It is old, older than this town. It is a bargain of love, not of fear.”

Tears, hot and sudden, pricked Elara’s eyes. There was a terrible, twisted nobility to it. A willing scapegoat. A transaction of suffering to save the whole.

“November 1st: All is arranged. The Offering was to be Thomas Harlow, the miller’s son. A good boy, strong, who loved his family’s land. But he has fled. Panic grips the Committee. The final night is upon us. The Heart-Oak groans in the wind, a sound like a dying beast. If the sacrifice is not given willingly, the anchor will hold nothing. The sickness will have no vessel, and will spread unchecked, forever.”

The next page was splattered with a brown stain that could have been ink, or something else. The writing was frantic, jagged.

“It is done. God forgive us, it is done. Thomas was found hiding in the old root cellar. He would not go willingly. He fought. They… we… bound him. His screams were not human as we carried him to the tree. The ritual was refused. The sacrifice was forced.”

Elara’s breath hitched. The room seemed to tilt.

“We performed the words, the binding. We used the Crown—the old Harvest Crown, woven from the last healthy wheat and the hair of those who came before—to focus the channel. But the magic, if magic it be, is a thread that must be willingly grasped. He thrashed against the bonds as the roots took him. The sickness flowed, but it was tainted with his terror, his rage. It did not purify. It anchored.
“The blight receded that winter. A hard, cold peace. We thought we had succeeded. But in the spring, Thomas’s young sister, Flora, took sick. She coughed up black soil. Lesions like tree bark appeared on her skin. She died before the summer, and where she was buried, nothing grows to this day.
“The ritual was refused. The sacrifice was forced. The blight was anchored… to a person. Not contained, but given a conscious thread. A lineage. It does not end. It passes, we know not how. It sleeps, and wakes, and feeds. We did not save Hollow Oak. We damned it to a slower consumption. We tied its hunger to a human line, and now it will forever seek that line out to complete the corrupted bargain.”

The journal fell from Elara’s numb fingers. The silence in the room was absolute, a physical weight.

She understood everything. The Harvest Crown in her exhibit wasn’t a quaint artifact. It was a ritual focus. Her acquisition of it, her integration of it into the town’s story during the festival, wasn’t professionalism. It was an invitation. A ringing of a dinner bell.

The migraines. The soil under her nails. The lesions mirroring the blight. She wasn’t becoming the sacrifice.

She was the sacrifice.

The corrupted lineage. Thomas Harlow, bound against his will. The blight anchored to a person. It had passed down, through blood or perhaps through a deeper, more terrible selection, lying dormant until the conditions were right—until the land grew hungry again and the ritual focus was presented to someone on the outside, someone desperate enough to take it, someone without roots here to question why.

Elara Vance, disgraced, rootless, hungry for her own kind of redemption. The perfect, unwitting vessel.

She looked at her throbbing palm, at the weeping, earthy wound. She wasn’t studying the blight. She was hosting* it. The land wasn’t dying around her; it was reclaiming her, pulling the sickness from its soil and into her flesh. She was the anchor. The final, living component of the Last Harvest.

A cold, clean certainty washed over her, scouring away the last vestiges of doubt. This was why she was here. Not by accident, but by design. A design written in rotten soil and old blood.

From the pocket of her coat, her phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number. She looked at it, the screen’s light a blasphemous blue in the historical gloom.

It was a photograph, grainy, taken from a distance. It showed her, just now, sitting in the pool of lamplight with the journal. The angle was from the high, narrow window at the back of the annex. Someone was outside. Watching.

Below the image, a single line of text appeared:

“The Harvest Crown needs its keeper. The Heart-Oak is waiting. Dawn is soon.”
