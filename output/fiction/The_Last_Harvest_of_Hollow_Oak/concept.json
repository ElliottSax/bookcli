  "title": "The Last Harvest of Hollow Oak",
  "genre": "horror",
  "subgenre": "folk horror",
  "premise": "A disgraced museum curator acquires a seemingly innocuous 'Harvest Crown'\u2014a woven circlet of wheat, bone, and blackened oak\u2014for a rural folklore exhibit. When worn during a local festival, it doesn't just summon the old gods of the harvest; it binds the wearer as the permanent sacrifice, forcing them to experience the agonizing, slow death of the land itself. To break the curse, she must convince the modern, skeptical town to re-enact a bloody, forgotten ritual, or become the eternal anchor for its blight.",
  "protagonist": "Dr. Elara Vance, a pragmatic academic whose career was ruined by her belief in the tangible power of folk rituals, now desperate to prove she wasn't wrong.",
  "conflict": "Elara must navigate the town's deep-seated denial, her own deteriorating physical and mental state as the crown's vessel, and the rising, hungry presence of the Old Ground, all while racing against the final dying of the autumn equinox.",
  "setting": "Present-day, the isolated and economically dying farming community of Hollow Oak, nestled in a forgotten valley where the cell service is poor but the old ways are strong.",
  "tone": "A creeping, atmospheric dread rooted in soil and superstition, where the true horror is the slow, inevitable consumption by a hungry land and the willing complicity of those who feed it."
