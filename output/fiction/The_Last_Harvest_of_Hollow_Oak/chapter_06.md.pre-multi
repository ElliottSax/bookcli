Chapter 6: Convincing the Unbelievers

Chapter 6: Convincing the Unbelievers

The Hollow Oak Town Hall was a sepulcher of good intentions. Its high, arched windows, meant to let in the bounty of the sun, now framed a sky the color of a week-old bruise. The air inside was a stale cocktail of lemon-scented polish, old wood, and the damp wool of the two dozen townsfolk crammed onto the varnished pews. Elara felt each scent as a separate, abrasive grain against her raw nerves. The soil she’d scrubbed from under her nails that morning seemed to have migrated inward, a gritty lining to her veins.

Beside her, Burris shifted his weight, the creak of his chair echoing like a gunshot in the hushed room. He hadn’t met her eyes since they’d arrived. His presence was a reluctant anchor, a concession wrung from him after she’d shown him the photographs: the concentric rings of blight spreading from the festival grounds, the spore-laden lesions on the underside of maple leaves that mirrored, with terrifying precision, the strange, bruise-like patterns now flowering across her own shoulder blades. He’d touched one of the photos, his calloused finger tracing a dead patch of corn, and sighed a sigh that came from the soles of his boots. “They won’t listen,” he’d said. “But I’ll stand there. For the record.”

Mayor Higgins presided from a raised dais, his face a monument of benign authority. The gavel in his hand was carved from the heartwood of the first Hollow Oak, a symbol now turned into a paperweight. To his right sat Mrs. Gable, the librarian, her lips pursed as if permanently tasting something sour. To his left, old man Cartwright, who owned the hardware store and most of the town’s debt, stared into the middle distance, his hearing aid whistling a thin, reedy tune.

“The floor is open for concerns regarding municipal affairs,” Higgins announced, his voice a smooth, practiced baritone. “Let’s keep it civil, folks. We’re all neighbors here.”

Elara stood. The movement sent a jolt of pain up her spine, a deep, throbbing ache that was not entirely her own. It was the ache of compacted roots, of soil turning to stone. She felt every eye upon her, a physical pressure like the weight of clay.

“Mayor Higgins, members of the council,” she began, her voice thinner than she’d hoped. She cleared her throat, tasting loam. “My name is Elara Vance. I’m a soil biologist. For the past three weeks, I’ve been studying the… the decline affecting our land.”

A low murmur rippled through the room. Higgins gave a patient, nodding smile. “We’re all aware of a tough season, Ms. Vance. Weather’s been uncooperative.”

“It’s not the weather,” Elara said, more forcefully. She gestured to Burris, who reluctantly stood and began distributing copies of her charts and photos. “This is a systemic necrosis. It follows a pattern inconsistent with any known pathogen or drought cycle. The soil pH is plummeting in specific, spreading rings. Microbial life is not just dying; it’s being consumed. And it’s accelerating.”

Mrs. Gable peered at a photo of blackened crop rows through her bifocals. “Looks like blight to me. We had something similar in ’78.”

“This is different,” Elara insisted. She pointed to a spectral analysis chart. “The organic matter isn’t decomposing. It’s vanishing. There’s a… a hunger to it.”

The word hung in the air, wrong and visceral. Cartwright’s hearing aid squealed.

“A hunger,” Higgins repeated, his smile tightening at the corners. “That’s a mighty dramatic word, Ms. Vance. You’ll forgive folks if they find that a bit alarmist.” He leaned forward, clasping his hands. “Now, I did some asking around. University of Greendale, right? Weren’t you let go from a research grant a few years back? Some controversy over… falsified data?”

The floor seemed to tilt beneath Elara. The air grew thicker, harder to pull into her lungs. She saw the faces in the pews shift, curiosity hardening into suspicion. Burris shot her a pained, sidelong glance. He hadn’t known.

“That was… it was a misunderstanding,” she said, the old shame a hot coal in her gut. “My findings were unorthodox, they were challenged, and the funding was pulled. It wasn’t fraud.”

“But it was about soil depletion theories, wasn’t it?” Higgins pressed, his voice a gentle, lethal weapon. “Theories your peers called ‘apocalyptic’ and ‘unscientific.’ Seems to me you have a habit of seeing the end of the world in a patch of dry dirt.”

A few nervous titters came from the crowd. Elara’s migraine, a constant companion now, pulsed behind her eyes in time with the slow, sick heartbeat she felt through the soles of her feet. Thump. Crush. Thump. Consume.

“This is not a theory!” she cried out, her composure cracking. “Look at the corn at the Henderson place! Look at the oaks on the ridge! They’re not just dying; they’re being emptied from the inside out! And it’s not just the plants.” She lowered her voice, a desperate, haunted whisper that carried to the back of the room. “It’s in the records. Fragments in the town ledger. ‘The Last Harvest.’ It’s happened before. Something is awake. And it’s feeding.”

Silence. Then, a voice, rough and weathered, came from the back. Liam O’Hara stood, his cap in his hands, his face a roadmap of deep-cut worry. “My south forty is gone,” he said, his voice trembling not with fear, but with a profound, weary grief. “Not dead. Gone. Dust that blows away and leaves nothin’ but hardpan that smells… wrong. Like a turned-over grave. She’s the only one who’s even tried to look. I don’t know about hungers or histories, but I know my land. And it’s being taken.”

A flicker of solidarity, quickly extinguished. Higgins sighed, a performance of fatherly disappointment. “Liam, we all sympathize. Really. But feeding into this hysteria isn’t going to bring your crop back. Ms. Vance here has a history of crying wolf, and now she’s brought her act to our town, at a time when we’re most vulnerable. I think that’s the real story.”

The condemnation was complete. Elara saw it in the set of their jaws, the averted gazes. She was no longer a scientist; she was a scapegoat, a convenient lightning rod for their unspoken terror. The pain in her back intensified, a burning, concentric pattern. She felt a sudden, violent tug in her gut, a magnetic pull downward.

Outside, the light through the arched windows died.

A deep, unnatural twilight fell. Then came the sound—a roaring, like a freight train descending from the clouds. The windows darkened further, not with cloud, but with a seething, metallic swarm.

“Hail,” someone whispered.

It wasn’t hail. It was a bombardment. Golf-ball-sized chunks of ice, jagged and milky-white, screamed down upon the town square. The sound on the slate roof was deafening, a cacophonous drumming that shook the very foundations. Through the window, they saw the historic gazebo splinter. The petunias in the planter boxes were pulverized into green and red pulp. The parked cars dimpled and screamed under the assault.

And then, as suddenly as it began, it stopped.

The silence that followed was absolute, ringing. Sunlight, perversely cheerful, streamed back through the shattered windows, glittering on the sea of ice that now covered the square. The destruction was meticulous, localized entirely to the municipal heart of Hollow Oak.

People rushed to the windows, gasping, crying out. Elara didn’t move. A cold certainty had settled over her. She walked slowly to the nearest window, her footsteps echoing in the stunned quiet. She looked out at the devastation, then down at the polished oak floorboards of the town hall.

“You want proof?” she said, her voice flat, empty of all hope. “You want to see the pattern?”

She didn’t wait for an answer. The connection was a live wire in her soul, a channel of pure, screaming feedback from the land. She focused on it—not fighting it, not this time. She let it rise. The pain in her back crested, a searing brand. She thought of the lesions on the leaves, the rings in the soil, the perfect, terrible geometry of consumption.

She knelt, placing her bare palms flat on the oak floor.

A gasp went through the crowd. A warmth, not pleasant but feverish and damp, radiated from her touch. The rich, golden oak beneath her hands began to change. It dulled, leaching of color, drying in an instant from the inside. A stain spread outwards in a perfect, slow-moving circle. The wood grain puckered, cracked, and turned to a dry, gray powder. The circle widened to the size of a wagon wheel, a dead, ashen patch on the floor of the hall. The smell of fresh-turned earth and decay filled the air, overpowering the lemon polish.

Elara swayed, withdrawing her hands. They were chalky with dust. She looked up, her face gaunt, her eyes holding the terrible, knowing emptiness of a fallow field.

The terror in the room was no longer vague. It was immediate, personal, and directed entirely at her.

“Witch,” someone hissed from the pews.

The word was taken up, a low, fearful chant. “Witch. Witch.”

Mayor Higgins’s face was pale, his authority shattered not by her evidence, but by her act. This was magic. This was the old, bad world breaking through. And she was its conduit. “Get out,” he croaked, pointing a shaking finger at her. “Get out of this hall. Get out of our town!”

Burris moved to her side, not to support her, but to pull her away, his face a mask of horror and betrayal. “What have you done?” he muttered.

Elara allowed herself to be led, a somnambulist. The crowd parted before her like she was a leper, their faces contorted with revulsion and primal fear. She had sought to show them the disease, and all they had seen was its symptom: her.

The cold evening air outside was a slap. The town square was a warzone of ice and splinters. She walked through it, unfeeling, Burris’s grip on her arm like a shackle. He released her at the edge of the green.

“Don’t come by the farm again,” he said, his voice hollow. “You’ve done enough.”

She walked home alone in the long, accusing twilight. The houses she passed had their curtains drawn. She was no longer just the outsider; she was the infection.

Her cottage was a tomb. She didn’t light a lamp. She sat in her armchair, watching the last light bleed from the sky, feeling the vast, silent hunger of the land pulsing beneath her, a rhythm she was now inextricably tied to. She had tried to speak its truth. It had used her voice to scream its own, and now she was alone with the echo.

The crash came just after full dark.

The front window exploded inwards in a shower of glittering daggers. A brick, large and rough-hewn, thudded onto her rug, rolling to a stop at her feet. Tied to it with twine was a scrap of paper.

Outside, only the sound of fleeing footsteps on gravel.

Trembling, not with fear but with a bottomless exhaustion, Elara untied the note. The words were blocky, anonymous, written in thick, charcoal pencil.

LEAVE OR BURN.

She let the paper fall. It fluttered to the floor beside the brick, a final verdict. She looked out through the shattered window into the perfect, consuming blackness of the Hollow Oak night. The land wasn’t just hungry for crops and trees. It was hungry for stories, for fear, for scapegoats. It had been fed a feast of it today. And she, Elara Vance, had served herself up on the platter.

In the dark, she began to laugh, a soft, broken sound that was very close to a sob. The hook was set. The land had her. And the town, her would-be saviors, were just another part of the grinding mechanism that would press her into its soil. There was no leaving. There was only the harvest.
