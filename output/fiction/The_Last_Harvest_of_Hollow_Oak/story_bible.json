The beauty of a fading autumn masks a pervasive sense of dread, stagnation, and being watched by the land itself. The atmosphere shifts from professional disgrace to eerie welcome, then to claustrophobic paranoia, and finally to apocalyptic terror."

      "name": "Old Man Finch",
      "role": "Keeper of Lore",

  "plot_summary": "Disgraced archaeologist Elara Vance accepts a curator position in the remote town of Hollow Oak, seeking anonymity. She discovers the town is obsessed with its annual 'Harvest Festival,' but her predecessor died under mysterious circumstances after researching the town's history. With the help of local farmer Leo Finch, Elara uncovers a dark truth: Hollow Oak survives not on agriculture, but on a primordial pact requiring a ritual sacrifice to the land every generation\u2014the 'Last Harvest.' The current mayor, Gareth Croft, has corrupted the ritual, substituting a hollow, unwilling victim (possibly a homeless person or outsider) to avoid sacrificing a town pillar and to enable commercial development. This act of bad faith breaks the ancient covenant. As the corrupted ritual concludes, the land itself awakens in a state of ravenous, reality-warping fury. The town begins to physically unravel. Realizing the only way to appease the entity is with a truly willing sacrifice\u2014a 'keeper' to become a 'keystone'\u2014Elara, seeking final redemption and to save the innocent, moves toward the pulsating Heart-Oak to offer herself, as Leo desperately tries to stop her.",
