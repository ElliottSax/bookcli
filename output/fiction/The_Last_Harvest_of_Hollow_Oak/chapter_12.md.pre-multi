Chapter 12: The Last Harvest

The silence after the Mayor’s scream was the loudest thing Elara had ever heard. It was a physical pressure, a ringing void that swallowed the gasps of the onlookers, the rustle of the dying leaves, even the frantic thrum of her own heart. The Heart-Oak, glutted on stolen life, pulsed with a sickly, verdant light. Where the Mayor had fallen, only a dark, greasy stain remained on the roots, already being drawn down into the hungry earth.

The blight didn’t recede. It accelerated.

A visible wave of gray, a shudder of decay, rolled out from the oak’s trunk like a ripple in a poisoned pond. The grass at Elara’s feet withered to ash. The few remaining golden leaves on the maples curled in on themselves, crumbling to dust before they could fall. The air grew thick with the smell of turned earth—not rich and loamy, but sour, like an opened grave.

“No,” Elara whispered, the word scraping her raw throat. “No, no, no.”

The anchor-bond—that psychic tether she’d forged with the land to understand it—went white-hot in her soul. It wasn’t a thread of connection anymore; it was a chain, a fuse burning down. She could feel Hollow Oak through it, every house, every field, every person. She felt the town’s foundations groaning, the last vitality in the soil being sucked toward the clearing. The corrupted ritual hadn’t appeased the hunger. It had shown it the way to the feast. And the bond she’d created was the conduit.

Mrs. Greer was sobbing, clutching her husband. Old Man Finch stared at the stain, his face a mask of horrified understanding. They all felt it, the sudden, vertiginous pull, the sense of the ground itself turning insubstantial beneath their feet.

Elara stumbled toward the Heart-Oak, her legs heavy as stone. The research, Rowan’s desperate notes, the fragmented folklore—it all came together into a single, terrible truth. The land didn’t want violence. It didn’t want a stolen life. The old ballads were clear, the oldest pages in the county records were adamant: A willing heart. A returned heart. The keeper becomes the keystone.

The Mayor had been many things, but willing he was not. His sacrifice was an insult, a fast-food meal thrown at a starving, discerning god. Now the god was angry, and it was going to take everything through the pipeline Elara had so cleverly installed.

She reached the oak, placing her palms against the bark. It was fever-warm, throbbing. Images assaulted her: the town square cracking open like a pie crust, houses tilting into sinkholes of pure nothingness, faces of people she knew—the librarian, the baker’s children, Leo—dissolving into the rushing gray. It was a preview. Minutes away, maybe less.

“It has to be me,” she said, not to the others, but to the tree, to the deep, ancient need beneath it.

“Elara, don’t you dare!” Leo’s voice was a whip-crack of fear. He grabbed her arm, his fingers bruising. “We’ll run. We’ll get everyone out.”

“To where?” she asked, her voi
