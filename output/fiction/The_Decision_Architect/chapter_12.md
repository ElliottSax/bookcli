# Chapter 12

**Chapter 12: The Final Choice**

The neon lights of the city flickered like dying stars as Victor Cross stood at the edge of the rooftop, the wind whipping at his coat. Below him, the metropolis pulsed with life—cars snaking through the streets, people moving like ants through the labyrinth of steel and glass. But up here, there was only silence. Only the weight of the decision he had to make.
His earpiece crackled. *"Victor, you can't do this."*

It was Elena. Her voice was strained, desperate. He could picture her in the control room, fingers flying over holographic displays, trying to find another way.
"I don't have a choice," he said, his voice low.
*"There's always a choice!"* she snapped.
Victor exhaled, watching his breath mist in the cold air. He had spent his life designing decisions—architecting the paths that shaped corporations, governments, even wars. Every variable accounted for, every outcome predicted. But this? This was different.
The device in his hand hummed softly, its interface glowing a deep, ominous red. A single press of the button would send a signal—one that would either save millions or doom them.

**Three Hours Earlier**

The underground bunker was a tomb of flickering screens and humming servers. Victor had spent the last seventy-two hours here, running simulations, tracing the threads of the crisis that had been building for months.
Elena burst through the door, her dark hair disheveled, her eyes wide. "They found us."

Victor didn’t look up. "How long?"

"Ten minutes, maybe less."

He clenched his jaw. The Consortium had moved faster than he’d anticipated. They had been hunting him ever since he’d stolen their core algorithm—the one that could predict human behavior with terrifying accuracy. The one they planned to weaponize.
"We need to go," Elena said, grabbing his arm.
He shook his head. "Not yet. I need to finish the countermeasure."

"You won't have *time* to finish if they kill us!"

Victor finally turned to her. "If they get this tech, Elena, they’ll control everything. Elections, markets, wars. They’ll turn the world into a chessboard."

She swallowed hard. "Then what’s the plan?"

He pulled up a holographic display—a blueprint of the city’s neural network. "We overload their system. Burn it out before they can deploy it."

Elena stared at the schematic. "That’s… that’s insane. You’d have to hack into the central grid, bypass their firewalls—"

"And trigger a city-wide blackout," Victor finished. "But it’s the only way to stop them."

She hesitated. "What if it doesn’t work?"

Victor met her gaze. "Then we die trying."

**Now**

The rooftop door burst open.
Victor didn’t turn. He already knew who it was.
"Cross." The voice was smooth, controlled.
"Director Kael," Victor replied, still facing the skyline. "I was wondering when you’d show up."

Kael stepped forward, flanked by two armored enforcers. His tailored suit was immaculate, his expression unreadable. "You’ve caused us a great deal of trouble."

Victor smirked. "I aim to disappoint."

Kael sighed, as if dealing with a petulant child. "Hand over the device, and we’ll make your death quick."

Victor finally turned, holding up the glowing module. "You mean this?"

The enforcers tensed, their weapons humming to life.
Kael’s eyes narrowed. "You’re outnumbered, Cross. Outgunned. There’s no scenario where you walk away from this."

Victor’s grip tightened on the device. "You’re right. But I don’t need to walk away."

Elena’s voice hissed in his ear. *"Victor, the override is ready. Just say the word."*

He exhaled. This was it. The final choice.
He could surrender. Let Kael take the tech. Live as a prisoner—or die as a martyr.
Or he could press the button. Burn it all down.
Kael took another step. "Last chance."

Victor smiled.
Then he pressed the button.

The city went dark.
Every light, every screen, every machine—gone.
For a heartbeat, there was silence.
Then the screams began.
Kael lunged, but Victor was already moving, sprinting for the edge of the roof. He didn’t stop. Didn’t hesitate.
He jumped.
The wind roared in his ears as he fell, the ground rushing up to meet him.
And then—

A jolt. A sudden stop.
The hidden parachute deployed, yanking him sideways into the night.
Kael’s enforcers fired, but their shots went wild in the chaos.
Victor soared over the darkened city, the device still humming in his hand.
Elena’s voice crackled through. *"You’re insane."*

He laughed. "Yeah. But it worked."

**Epilogue: One Week Later**

The news feeds called it the "Great Blackout." A system failure. A freak accident.
No one mentioned the Consortium.
Victor sat in a small café on the outskirts of the city, sipping black coffee. The morning sun cast long shadows across the table.
Elena slid into the seat across from him. "You look like hell."

He grinned. "I feel like it."

She studied him for a long moment. "What now?"

Victor set down his cup. "Now? We rebuild. Better this time."

She raised an eyebrow. "You really think that’s possible?"

He leaned back, watching the people pass by outside—living, breathing, *choosing*.
"Yeah," he said. "I do."

The End.
