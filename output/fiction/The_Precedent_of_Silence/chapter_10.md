Chapter 10: Panic in the Streets

Chapter 10: Panic in the Streets

The silence in A High-Stakes Courtroom had been a vacuum. The silence in the world, Elara discovered, was a different beast entirely. It was the held breath before a scream, the static hiss between radio stations broadcasting emergency alerts. It was the sound of millions of people, in quiet kitchens and dimly-lit bathrooms, staring at a pill bottle, and deciding to be afraid.

The first reports trickled in like a slow leak. A seventy-two-year-old in Des Moines, atrial fibrillation spiraling into a fatal stroke. A forty-year-old mother in Phoenix, her lupus nephritis flaring unchecked, kidneys shutting down. A scattered handful, then a dozen, then a flood that crashed over the news cycle, drowning out the legalese of her case. The headlines were merciless in their simplicity: “Lawyer’s Claims Cause Deaths.” “Zyloxen Panic Turns Deadly.”

Elara saw them on a gas station television, the sound off, as she pumped bitter coffee into a styrofoam cup. Her own face, pale and severe from A High-Stakes Courtroom sketches, flashed next to a photo of a grieving family in Ohio. The clerk inside watched her, recognition dawning, his expression shifting from boredom to a kind of wary revulsion. She kept her head down, the paper cup too hot in her hand, the smell of burnt gasoline and stale pastry suddenly overwhelming. This was the cost. Not in abstract legal briefs, but in the specific, terrible arithmetic of the body. Veridian hadn’t pulled the trigger; they’d just handed the gun to a panicked public and she’d shouted a warning that sounded like the firing pin clicking.

Her phone, set to vibrate, danced across the passenger seat like a dying insect all the way back to the office. Calls from numbers she didn’t know. Calls from numbers she did. Martin, her lead plaintiff, his voice thin with a new, raw fear: “My sister… she stopped taking them last week. She’s in the ICU. People are saying it’s your fault.” He didn’t say he agreed. He didn’t need to.

The office was a tomb. Anya, her intern, worked with headphones on, blocking out the world, but her eyes were red-rimmed. The usual hum of the building’s HVAC was gone, replaced by a tense, listening quiet. On her desk, amid the towers of binders, sat a single, crisp envelope. A summons to appear before the Congressional Committee on Oversight and Regulatory Affairs. In five days. The subject: “The Public Health Consequences of Litigation-Driven Fear.”

It wasn’t a hearing. It was a pillory.
The committee room in the Rayburn Building was a study in cold, imposing grandeur. High ceilings, dark wood paneling that absorbed light, the flags of the nation and the committee hanging limp in the still, over-chilled air. The room smelled of lemon polish, old paper, and a faint, metallic tang of power. The long dais loomed above her, a mahogany cliff face populated by a shifting tableau of politicians. Some leaned forward, hungry. Others sat back, performing disinterest. Camera lenses, from the press gallery at the back, were unblinking black eyes.

Elara sat alone at the small, isolated witness table, a microphone snaking towards her like a threat. She could feel the weight of the room pressing down, a physical force on her shoulders. Her charcoal suit felt like a shell, too tight across her back.

“Ms. Vance,” began the Chairman, a silver-haired man from a tobacco state, his drawl softening the edges of his words into something more dangerous. “You initiated litigation alleging grave dangers about a drug upon which, we are now told, some three million Americans depend. In the wake of your… allegations, we have seen a public health crisis unfold. A secondary crisis. People are dying not from Zyloxen, but from the fear of it. How do you reconcile your pursuit of justice with these bodies piling up?”

The language was deliberate. Bodies piling up. She could see the soundbite forming already.

“Mr. Chairman,” she began, her voice surprisingly steady in the cavernous room. “The crisis was created not by the truth, but by its absence. Veridian Pharmaceuticals had data for years suggesting a genetic vulnerability. They chose silence. That silence is the precedent that now forces people into an impossible choice: risk a sudden death, or risk the death they know from their chronic illness. They are trapped in a nightmare Veridian designed.”

A congresswoman from California cut in, her tone sharp. “By litigating in the court of public opinion, you became the messenger. And now the message has killed people. Your moral certainty looks a lot like collateral damage from where I sit.”

The phrase collateral damage hung in the chilled air. Elara felt a hot needle of anger pierce through the numbness. She looked at the congresswoman, then at the rows of faces. She saw not inquisitors seeking truth, but performers managing a catastrophe. Their concern was the panic, not the poison.

“With respect,” Elara said, leaning into the mic, her words crisp. “This committee has the power to subpoena Veridian’s internal records. To demand the genetic data. To call their executives and ask why a safer alternative was shelved. You could provide the public with clarity, not just critique the chaos. Are you investigating the source of the fire, or just berating the person who smelled smoke?”

A murmur rippled through the press gallery. The Chairman’s gavel tapped, a dry, authoritative crack. “You are here to answer questions, Ms. Vance, not to question the committee’s mandate. Your legal strategy has demonstrably caused harm. What is your solution? Do you persist in demanding a full recall, knowing it will undoubtedly cause more death?”

It was the question that had haunted her sleepless nights, the ethical maze with no exit. Demand the recall, become responsible for the deaths of those who couldn’t transition. Drop the case, let the vulnerable keep playing genetic roulette. There was no clean win. Only a choice of tragedies.

Then, in the sterile glare of the hearing room, the risky, desperate shape of a third path coalesced in her mind. It was not a path to victory, but to a less horrific defeat.

“The solution,” she said, the idea forming fully even as she spoke it aloud, “is not a blanket recall. The solution is a targeted one. Veridian developed an alternative drug, years ago. A modified formulation with a better safety profile for the vulnerable genotype. They shelved it because it was more expensive to manufacture. My proposal is not to burn the only bridge these patients have. It is to build a safer one, right next to it. Force Veridian to resurrect the alternative, mandate genetic screening for all Zyloxen patients, and transition the at-risk population to the safer drug. The rest can continue their treatment, without fear.”

The committee room went utterly silent. She had shifted the ground. She was no longer the reckless radical demanding a scorched-earth recall. She was proposing a surgical, public health-minded fix. She saw the change in their eyes—from condemnation to calculation. This was a narrative they could potentially use.

“And how do you propose to force a multi-billion-dollar corporation to do this, Ms. Vance?” another senator asked, skepticism etched on his face.

“Through the settlement you are all no doubt hoping for,” Elara said, a bluntness in her tone that made a few aides lean in to whisper to their principals. “A settlement that funds a lifetime of screening, transition, and monitoring. A settlement that doesn’t just write a check, but mandates a solution.”

She was played out of the hearing room ninety minutes later, not with thanks, but with a palpable sense of reprieve. They had their soundbite: Lawyer Proposes Screening, Not Recall. The narrative was pivoting. But in the marble hallway, echoing with the clicks of her own heels, Elara knew the real work had just begun. She had to find the ghost—the shelved alternative.

The “shelved” drug wasn’t in a dusty archive. It was in plain sight, buried in the million-page document dump Veridian had provided, a tactic meant to drown her. It was mentioned in a single, dry memo from the early product development team, codenamed “VX-117,” later dubbed “Zylura.” The reason for termination: “Projected cost of goods exceeds target margin for intended market segment by 22%.”

Twenty-two percent. That was the price of a safer molecule.

Finding someone who had worked on it was harder. The team had been disbanded, scattered. She tracked a lead chemist, Dr. Aris Thorne, to a small research institute in Oregon. He was reluctant, fearful, his voice on the phone a tense whisper. “That was a lifetime ago. Veridian owns that work.”

“They own the patent,” Elara countered, standing in her dark office, the city lights blurring through the rain-streaked window. “They don’t own the truth. People are dying, Dr. Thorne. Not from some unknown side effect—from the one you designed VX-117 to avoid.”

There was a long silence filled with the hiss of the long-distance line. “It worked,” he finally said, the words heavy with a old, professional pride. “The binding affinity was slightly lower, so the dosage was a bit higher. Needed a purer precursor. More synthesis steps. The bean-counters saw a cost, not a cure.” He gave her the name of the external contractor who had manufactured the clinical trial batches. A small, specialized firm in New Jersey.

Elara and Anya drove through the night, through pounding rain that turned the highway into a river of reflected taillights. The facility was a nondescript concrete box in an industrial park that smelled of wet asphalt and chemical runoff. The manager, a weary-faced man named Leo, was initially hostile, guarding his client confidentiality agreements.

Elara didn’t show him a subpoena. She showed him her phone, a news article about the Ohio mother who had died of lupus complications after stopping Zyloxen. She showed him a picture of Martin’s sister, alive and smiling, before the ICU.

“They stopped taking it because they’re scared,” Elara said, her voice raw from the road and the coffee. “We can give them something to take that they don’t have to fear. The formula is here. You made it. You know it’s clean.”

Leo looked from the phone screen to Elara’s face, to Anya’s hopeful, exhausted one. He rubbed his jaw. “The storage fees for discontinued trial materials… they lapsed years ago. Veridian abandoned the physical assets.” He led them, without another word, into a vast, chilled warehouse. Racks of pallets vanished into the gloom. He stopped at a far corner, where a plastic shroud was draped over a small pallet. He pulled it back.

There they were. Twenty-four cardboard boxes, stamped with a faded “VX-117” and a long-expired date. The final clinical trial batch. The proof that a solution had existed, tangible and real. Elara reached out, her fingers brushing the cold, dust-filmed cardboard. It wasn’t just evidence. It was a lifeline, sitting here in the deep freeze, waiting.

“We need a vial,” she said, her breath fogging in the cold air.

Judge Warrington’s chambers were not designed for comfort. They were a stage for pressure. The judge himself sat behind his massive desk, looking older than he had at the start of the trial, the weight of the unfolding national drama bowing his usually ramrod posture. Arthur sat with Veridian’s lead counsel, a woman named Cynthia Foss whose elegance was armor. Elara sat opposite, the single vial of VX-117, now in a clear evidence bag, on the desk between them like a contested jewel.

“The streets are not a A High-Stakes Courtroom,” Warrington began, his voice gravelly. “They don’t abide by motions to dismiss or rules of evidence. People are making medical decisions based on headlines, and they are dying. This… spectacle… must end. I am urging—strongly urging—the parties to engage in immediate, around-the-clock settlement discussions. The public interest demands it.”

Cynthia Foss inclined her head. “Your Honor, Veridian has always been willing to discuss resolution. Our primary concern is ending the public panic and ensuring patients continue their vital therapy.”

“Your primary concern,” Elara interjected, “was the stock price. It’s why you shelved this.” She tapped the evidence bag. “Zylura. A safer alternative. A settlement that doesn’t address that is just a price tag on the problem you created.”

Arthur, silent until now, spoke. His voice was calm, fatherly, and it made Elara’s skin crawl. “Elara. No one in this room wants more harm. But demanding a complete overhaul of a drug regimen for millions, based on a potential risk to a subset, is what caused this panic. You must see that. We need to stop the bleeding.”

We. The word was a masterstroke. It implied a shared burden, a shared failure. It sought to pull her back into the fold of reasonable, pragmatic officers of the court, away from the radical shouting in the wilderness.

“The bleeding won’t stop with a check and an NDA,” Elara said, holding Arthur’s gaze. “It stops with a plan. Screening. The alternative. A transition protocol.”

Judge Warrington steepled his fingers. “Ms. Foss. Is the alternative viable?”

Foss hesitated, a flicker of annoyance breaking through her composure. “The intellectual property is complex. Resurrecting a discontinued product line is a multi-year, billion-dollar endeavor.”

“It was viable enough to reach Phase III trials,” Elara shot back. “The only thing that killed it was the margin.” She turned back to the judge. “A settlement can fund it. It can mandate it. Your Honor can retain jurisdiction to enforce the public health provisions. The precedent doesn’t have to be silence. It can be safety.”

Warrington looked from Elara’s fierce, exhausted face to Foss’s polished neutrality, to Arthur’s grave concern. He saw the vial. He saw the front page of the Washington Post on his desk, the headline about the climbing death toll.

“You have forty-eight hours,” he said, the finality in his tone brooking no argument. “Come back to me with a framework. Or I will start issuing rulings on the pending motions that will force this trial to continue, and the chaos outside this courthouse will become my A High-Stakes Courtroom’s problem. Dismissed.”
The call came at 3:17 AM. Elara was in her office, surrounded by the ghosts of her case, running numbers on the cost of nationwide genetic screening. Cynthia Foss’s voice was stripped of its A High-Stakes Courtroom cadence, flat and efficient.

“We have an offer. A global settlement. One-point-eight billion dollars. A fund for the plaintiffs, a separate fund for a patient assistance program for… alternative therapies. Full compensation for all claimed injuries. All legal fees covered.”

Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs. It was a staggering number. A victory by any metric she’d known before this case. “And the alternative drug? The screening mandate?”

A pause, like static over the line. “The settlement is comprehensive and final. It resolves all claims. Veridian will, as part of its ongoing commitment to patient care, evaluate the feasibility of further research into personalized medicine approaches for Zyloxen.”

Elara closed her eyes. The trap was exquisitely baited. Evaluate the feasibility. It was the language of committees and delays. It meant nothing.

“And the confidentiality?” she asked, already knowing the answer.

“Full and permanent,” Foss said. “All documents sealed. All testimony impounded. No admission of liability or fault. The public narrative will be that independent review found no definitive causal link, but Veridian is settling to avoid protracted litigation and to fund patient care. The panic ends. The patients get help. Your people are made whole.”

My people. The plaintiffs. Martin, who wanted to pay off his sister’s medical bills and his mortgage. The others, who wanted to secure their children’s futures. They were sick, they were tired, they were scared. One-point-eight billion dollars was not just money; it was an escape hatch from a nightmare.

“And the truth?” Elara whispered into the dark room.

“The truth,” Foss said, her voice softening into something almost like pity, “is a luxury that is currently getting people killed. You have twenty-four hours to present the offer to your class and recommend acceptance. Judge Warrington is prepared to approve it immediately.”

The line went dead.

Elara sat in the silence. The precedent of silence. Arthur’s creation. It wasn’t a legal doctrine; it was a virus. It infected everything. It offered peace through oblivion. A billion-dollar bandage over a festering, hidden wound. She could give her clients riches beyond their dreams, and in doing so, she would become the latest enforcer of the very silence she had sworn to shatter. She would take the truth, the ugly, complex, murderous truth about cost-benefit analyses and genetic dice-rolls, and she would bury it in a vault, paid for with blood money.

The hook was set. The offer was on the table. All she had to do was convince the people she fought for to take the money, and let the world forget why it was offered. She had to make them complicit in the silence. She had to become Arthur.
