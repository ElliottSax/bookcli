# Chapter 11

**Chapter 11: The Final Rep**  

The gym was quieter than usual. The hum of the fluorescent lights overhead was the only sound as I stood in front of the last machine—a towering, sleek contraption labeled **"The Deadline Press."**  

It was the final test.  

Coach Riley leaned against the wall, arms crossed, watching me with that knowing half-smile. "You’ve come a long way," he said. "But this one’s different. It doesn’t measure strength or speed. It measures commitment."  

I wiped my palms on my gym shorts. "So, no more metaphors?"  

He chuckled. "Oh, it’s still a metaphor. But this time, the weight is real."  

I stepped forward, gripping the cold metal handles. The machine’s digital display flickered to life:  

**PROJECT: NOVEL**  
**DEADLINE: 30 DAYS**  
**PROGRESS: 0%**  

A pit formed in my stomach. Thirty days. A whole novel. I’d spent years telling myself I’d write one "someday." Now, the machine was calling my bluff.  

"Remember," Riley said, "procrastination isn’t about laziness. It’s about fear. Fear of failure, fear of success, fear of the work being harder than you imagined. This machine makes you face it head-on."  

I took a deep breath and pulled.  

The resistance was immediate—like dragging an anchor through mud. My muscles burned, but the progress bar didn’t budge.  

"Small steps," Riley called. "One sentence. Then another."  

I gritted my teeth and pushed.  

**PROGRESS: 1%**  

A chime sounded. The machine whirred, adjusting the weight.  

And then, the real test began.

### **The Distraction Gauntlet**  

The gym’s walls flickered, morphing into my apartment. My phone buzzed on the coffee table. A notification: *"5 Fun Ways to Avoid Writing Today!"*  

I hesitated.  

"Don’t look at it," Riley warned.  

But the pull was magnetic. I reached for it—  

**PROGRESS: 0%**  

The machine reset. I groaned.  

"Again," Riley said.  

I gripped the handles. This time, when the phone buzzed, I turned away.  

**PROGRESS: 2%**  

The machine hummed approvingly.  

Then came the next distraction—a TV flickering to life, playing my favorite show. The couch looked so inviting…  

I shook my head and kept pulling.  

**PROGRESS: 5%**  

The TV snapped off.  

Riley nodded. "Good. Now the hard part."

### **The Inner Critic**  

A voice echoed in my head—my own, but sharper, crueler.  

*"You’re not a real writer. This is garbage. Why bother?"*  

The progress bar wavered. My hands trembled.  

"Shut it down," Riley said.  

"How?"  

"Write anyway."  

I exhaled and forced myself forward. The voice grew louder, more insistent, but I kept moving.  

**PROGRESS: 10%**  

The voice faded.  

Riley grinned. "That’s the secret. The critic never goes away. You just learn to outwork it."

### **The Marathon**  

Days blurred. The machine’s display ticked upward—20%, 50%, 75%. My body ached, but the momentum carried me.  

Then, at 90%, I hit the wall.  

Exhaustion. Doubt. The urge to quit.  

"Almost there," Riley urged.  

I dug deep, thinking of all the times I’d given up before. The half-finished projects. The excuses.  

Not this time.  

With a final heave, I slammed the handles forward.  

**PROGRESS: 100%**  

A triumphant chime rang out. The machine’s display flashed:  

**"COMPLETE."**  

I collapsed to my knees, gasping. Riley clapped me on the back.  

"You did it."  

I looked up, grinning. "Yeah. I did."

### **The Real Work Begins**  

As the gym faded around me, Riley’s voice lingered.  

"Remember, this isn’t the end. It’s the warm-up. The real work starts now—outside these walls."  

I nodded, rolling my shoulders. The weight of procrastination was gone.  

For the first time in years, I was ready.
