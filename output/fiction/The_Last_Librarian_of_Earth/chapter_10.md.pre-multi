Chapter 10: The Silent Spring

The world was a soft, unfocused thing. It had been for some time. Elara would wake in her small, sun-drenched cottage—the one she’d rented after the diagnosis, the one with the overgrown courtyard—and for a few precious seconds, there would be only the warmth of the quilt and the dust motes dancing in a slant of light. Then the remembering would return. Not the grand, world-spanning remembrance she had performed, but a quieter, more persistent echo: a hollow space inside her where something vast had been carved out. She felt like a library that had been meticulously emptied, the shelves dusted and left bare, the only trace of the books a lingering scent of paper and a profound, aching silence in the air.

They had returned her, as promised. To a point just before. The headaches were still faint whispers, the doctor’s appointment a vague anxiety on next week’s calendar. But she was a stranger to herself. Her hands, smoothing the sheets each morning, seemed like artifacts. They were the hands of a woman in her late sixties, speckled with sun and time, but she could not reconcile them with the memories that were… not gone, but unmoored. Faces floated behind her eyes without names. A feeling of immense, crushing weight, followed by a sublime lightness. The taste of salt and starlight. The sound of a voice, deep and resonant with the weight of epochs, saying a final, terrible, necessary thing.

She would grasp for it, and it would dissolve, leaving only the melancholy residue.

She would sit by the window, a blank journal open before her. She knew, with a certainty that felt implanted in her bones, that she needed to write. But the words that came were thin, ghostly things. She would write “Aethel,” and stare at it, the shape of the letters both intimately familiar and utterly alien. Who was Aethel? A friend? A sister? A lover? A character from a book she’d loved? The word would blur, the ink seeming to bleed into the paper and vanish, though when she blinked, it would still be there, a meaningless cipher.

It was on a morning like any other, the air cool and sweet with the scent of damp earth, that she saw it.

She was washing her cup in the small sink, looking absently into the courtyard. It was a wild, neglected place, all tangled ivy, stubborn dandelions, and a single, ancient, gnarled apple tree that hadn’t borne fruit in years. And there, at the very center, where only moss and cracked flagstones had been the evening before, was a sapling.

She dried her hands slowly, her breath catching. It was perhaps three feet tall, slender and willowy. Its bark was not brown or grey, but a pale, luminous silver, like the memory of moonlight captured in wood. It had a handful of leaves, each one a perfect, delicate shape she could not name, the col
