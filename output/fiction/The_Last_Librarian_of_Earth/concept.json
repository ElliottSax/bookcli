  "title": "The Last Librarian of Earth",
  "genre": "fantasy",
  "subgenre": "portal",
  "premise": "A terminally ill archivist is pulled into a dying fantasy world not as its prophesied warrior, but as its final witness. The gods who summoned her don't need a savior; they need someone to remember their civilization's stories before the apocalypse, so their essence isn't lost forever. Now, she must choose between using her limited time to fight a hopeless war or to perform the ultimate act of preservation, knowing her own world has already forgotten her.",
  "protagonist": "Elara Vance, a meticulous and quietly rebellious archivist facing a terminal diagnosis with a profound fear of being forgotten.",
  "conflict": "Elara must defy the desperate demands of a pantheon and a rebellion that wants to weaponize her 'Chosen One' status, battling not monsters but the very concept of oblivion itself, to give a dying world a meaningful end through remembrance.",
  "setting": "Modern-day London, contrasted with the fading, memory-based realm of Aethelgard, where physical reality unravels as stories are lost.",
  "tone": "Melancholic, philosophical, and ultimately hopeful; a quiet, character-driven exploration of legacy, memory, and what makes an ending meaningful."
