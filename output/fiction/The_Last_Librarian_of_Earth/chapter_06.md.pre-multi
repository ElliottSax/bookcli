Chapter 6: The Rebellion of the Remembered

The archive's silence had changed. It wasn't the deep, listening quiet of preservation anymore, but the held-breath stillness before a scream. Elara felt it in the vibration of the stone floors, in the way the dust motes usually drifting in serene sunbeams now trembled in the air. The Unmaking was at the gates of the Sentinel's Hold. And Tarn had taken her words to war.

She heard about it from the echoes that reached her, since he hadn't come back. Those distant, percussive thumps that weren't thunder. The occasional strain of melody on the ash-tinged wind. Her melodies. The war-songs of the Sun-Kings, the marching chants of the Clay-Foot Legion. Tarn had found a way to amplify them, to hurl the ghosts of courage against the advancing silence.

Elara sat at her desk, a half-finished entry on extinct sky-whales before her. Her hand was steady, but inside, she was a cauldron of conflict. She had wanted the stories remembered, not weaponized. Then again, wasn't this a form of remembrance? A final, defiant performance? That philosophical knot was cut when the library doors crashed open.

Two soldiers stood there, their faces grimed with soot and exhaustion. Remnants of the city guard, their uniforms tattered.

Cobalt-blue mosaics were veined with cracks, the fragrant hanging gardens were skeletal, dripping grey vines. The air smelled of ozone, crushed stone, and the coppery tang of blood still too distant to see.

The sound reached her first. A cacophony of desperation. The clash of steel on something that rang with a hollow, wrong tone. And beneath it, rising in ragged, glorious bursts, were the songs. Her songs. A chorus of fifty last voices, singing the Hymn of the Ironwood, their voices cracking on the high notes. It was the most beautiful and terrible thing she had ever heard.

They brought her to a collapsed section of the inner wall, a vantage point of jagged stone and splintered timber. Below, in the shattered plaza before
