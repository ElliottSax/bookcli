Chapter 11: The Council of the Unchosen

Chapter 11: The Council of the Unchosen

The air in the old Granary Hall smelled of desperation, damp wool, and the ghost of last season’s rye. It was a fitting cathedral for their heresy. Kael leaned against a splintered support beam, the grit of ancient dust grinding under his fingernails. From his vantage point, he could see the whole sorry congregation.

To the left, huddled on rough benches, were the commoners’ representatives: a grizzled blacksmith with forearms like ham hocks, a weaver whose eyes were still red from tear-gas in the riots, and a farmer who kept nervously wiping her palms on her skirts, leaving streaks of good, honest mud on the fabric. They smelled of sweat and smoke and a fragile, terrifying hope.

To the right, on chairs that were only marginally better, sat the “honest nobles.” A term that made Loren, standing stiffly beside a cracked window, snort into his wine cup. They were the minor lords, the indebted barons, the ones whose lands were too poor or whose lineages were too tainted for the high court. They wore faded velvets and watched the commoners like cats watching unfamiliar dogs.

At the far end, on woven mats they’d brought themselves, were the Southern Tribes delegation. Three of them, faces etched with wind and sun, their leathers and furs starkly practical against the hall’s shabby grandeur. They said nothing, only watched, their dark eyes missing nothing. They’d come because Elara had asked, in the old tongue, and because they had their own scores to settle with the Crown.

In the centre, at a table made from doors laid across barrels, were the scholars from the Royal Archive, now just the Archive. They fussed with scrolls and ink pots, their voices a low, anxious buzz.

“A fine army,” Kael muttered to Elara, who was meticulously arranging fragments of pre-prophetic legal parchment. “The blind, the bankrupt, and the bitter.”

“Plus one cynical sell-sword with a demon’s shadow in his eyes,” she replied without looking up. “Don’t sell us short. We have a full set.”

Loren drifted over, the scent of cheap wine and expensive anxiety clinging to him. “My father isn’t here. Neither is Lord Bering. None of the major warhawks have deigned to attend our little ‘tea party.’” He took a sip. “Which means they’re either planning to ignore us into oblivion or kill us.”

“Optimism,” Kael said, pushing off the beam. “That’s what I hired you for.”

“You don’t pay me.”

“Then your pessimism is a charitable donation. Let’s begin before they realize they have nothing in common and start eating each other.”

Kael didn’t move to the head of the door-table. He walked into the middle of the open space, the floorboards creaking under his boots. The murmuring died. All eyes fixed on him—the man who broke the world. He saw fear, curiosity, resentment, and in the eyes of the blacksmith, a flicker of something like kinship.

“Right,” Kael said, his voice cutting the chill air. “We’re not here because we like each other. We’re here because the people who used to be in charge were either puppets, parasites, or pricks. The puppet strings are cut. The parasites are getting hungry. The pricks…” He glanced at Loren. “Are sharpening their swords. We can stand here measuring each other’s worth, or we can decide what happens next before Valerius or someone like him decides for us.”

The noblewoman, Lady Anya of the depleted silver mines, drew herself up. “And what qualifies you to lead this… discussion, Master Kael? You are not of noble blood. You hold no land. By what right?”

It was the opening volley. Kael had expected it.

“By right of the three hundred gold crowns the late, unlamented Guild paid me to die for them,” he said flatly. A few blinked. “By right of the fact that I’ve seen the gears of the prophecy from the inside, and they’re rusted and slick with shit. And by right of this.” He tapped the side of his head. “I’ve negotiated with river pirates, southern warlords, and Guild accountants. If I can get those bastards to part with a percentage, I can maybe get you to talk to each other.”

A grudging chuckle came from the commoners’ benches. The blacksmith nodded.

Elara rose then, a fragment of crumbling vellum in her hands. “By historical right, as well,” she said, her voice clear and scholar-calm. “The Granary Hall is where the First Accord was signed, three centuries before the first Chosen was ever ‘revealed’. The Accord was between the Mountain Tribes, the Grain-Growers’ League, and the City Wardens. A council of equals, for mutual survival.” She held up the vellum. “The ink is faded, but the clause is clear: ‘Rule by destiny is rule by delirium. Let law be chosen, not revealed.’”

The scholars practically vibrated with validation. The tribespeople leaned forward, interest finally sparking in their eyes. Their ancestors had signed that.

“A pretty history,” scoffed a portly baron. “But history doesn’t stop armies. Who leads this council? Who commands the loyalty of the guards? Who speaks with one voice to the outside?”

“No one,” Kael said.

The word hung in the dusty air.

“No one person,” he amended. “You’ll have a speaker. A rotating position. You’ll have committees for defence, for grain, for justice. Made up of,” he pointed to each group, “one of you, one of you, and one of you. And a tribesperson. And a scholar to read the damned small print so you don’t cheat each other.”

“Preposterous,” Lady Anya sputtered. “Government by committee is government by paralysis!”

“Better than government by divine whim and a stab in the back,” the weaver snapped, her voice raw. “We’ve had that. Our children are hungry.”

The debate erupted, a cacophony of fear, anger, and long-suppressed grievance. Kael let it roar for a minute, watching the dynamics. The blacksmith and the miner found common ground complaining about Guild tariffs. The farmer and a tribeswoman discovered a shared technique for preserving root vegetables. They were finding links, fragile as spider silk.

Loren moved then, gliding toward the knot of minor nobles. He used a different language: not of rights, but of advantage. “Lord Tomas,” he said to the portly baron, his tone conspiratorial. “Your lands border my father’s. If he mobilizes, where do you think his hungry men will go first for forage? Not toward the fortified capital. Toward your fat herds.”

Lord Tomas paled. “He wouldn’t.”

“He’s got the scent of a crown in his nostrils. He’d eat his own horse and ask for mustard. But if this council stands, your voice in the defence committee could ensure any standing force protects the border regions first.” Loren’s smile was thin and sharp. “A vote here is cheaper than a regiment of mercenaries. And more loyal.”

Kael watched his friend work, a hollow admiration in his chest. Loren was using his upbringing like a lockpick, turning the tumblers of noble paranoia. It was sickening. It was necessary.

Hours bled away. The grey light from the high windows softened into amber. They had outlines, screaming matches, moments of startling accord. A framework was emerging, ugly and lopsided and real. They were arguing about tax distribution, for fate’s sake, not the will of gods.

It was when they broke for a meagre supper of bread and hard cheese that the betrayal unfolded, not with a dagger, but with a banner.

Marten, the leader of the commoners’ militia—a former carpenter with a firebrand’s heart who had fought beside Kael in the riots—unfurled a length of cloth from his pack. He climbed onto a barrel as the others ate.

“Friends! Look what we have forged from the old!” He shook it out. It was a standard, crude but bold: a black sword broken across a red field. Kael’s old mercenary company sigil, merged with the red of the fallen Spire.

A chill that had nothing to do with the draft swept through Kael.

“We have a symbol!” Marten cried, his face alight. “And we have the man! We’ve danced around it all day. Committees? Speakers? We need a king! A true king, not a chosen one. A king who earned his crown in blood and broken chains!” He pointed a trembling, fervent finger at Kael. “Him! The Unchosen King!”

Silence, thick and sudden.

Then, a roar from perhaps a third of the hall—mostly commoners, but a few nobles, too, their eyes shining with the simple, terrifying solution. A king. One man to fix it. The oldest reflex in the world.

Kael felt the crown hovering over his head, invisible and heavier than iron. He saw Elara’s horrified face. He saw Loren close his eyes in despair.

Marten jumped down, beaming, and thrust the banner into Kael’s hands. The hall held its breath.

Kael looked at the rough stitching, the clumsy heraldry. He thought of the Guild Master’s dead eyes, of the cosmic weight of a destiny he’d shattered. He thought of the inevitable, slow corruption of one man’s power, even his own. Especially his own.

He let the banner fall. It crumpled on the dirty floor between them.

“No,” he said. The word wasn’t loud, but it cut.

Marten’s smile froze. “What?”

“I said no.” Kael addressed the room now, his voice gravelly with fatigue. “You want a king? Go find one. I’m not him. I spent my life getting stains out of carpets that kings bled on. I’m not adding my own.”

“But the people follow you!” Marten pleaded, betrayal flashing in his eyes.

“Then they’re fools,” Kael said, ruthless. “I’m a knife. You use a knife to cut a knot. You don’t put it on a throne and ask it to govern. It’ll just sit there looking sharp until someone gets hurt.” He kicked the banner aside. “This ends with one person in charge, it ends right back where we started. Just with a different arse on the velvet cushion. My answer is no. It will always be no.”

The fervour in the hall deflated, replaced by a confused, weary tension. Marten stared at him, his dream shattered, his face a mask of bitter hurt. He turned and shoved his way out of the hall without a word.

The silence he left behind was worse than the shouting.

It was Elara who broke it. She walked to the centre and stood on the fallen banner. “He has given you the only gift a true leader can,” she said softly. “The gift of your own responsibility. It is harder than a crown. Now. Shall we finish? The defence committee proposal is still missing a clause about militia rotation.”

The work resumed, slower now, sobered. The spectre of easy salvation had been offered and rejected. The hard, tedious road was all that remained.

By the time the torches were lit, they had it. The Charter of the Granary Accord. A messy, contradictory, infuriating document that gave no one everything and everyone something. They signed it in turns: a blacksmith’s sooty thumbprint, the elegant script of Lady Anya, the angular clan-mark of the Southern Tribes, the precise hand of the Head Scholar, and finally, Kael’s own jagged signature—not as a ruler, but as a witness.

It was done.

A fragile, exhausted relief settled over the hall. They began to talk of practicalities, of sending copies, of securing the district for the night. For a moment, it felt possible.

Then the doors exploded inwards.

Not just the main doors, but the side entrances too. They burst open not with a magical blast, but with the brutal, physical force of armoured men wielding a battering ram. The splintering wood was a sharper, more visceral sound than any spell.

Duke Valerius, Loren’s father, strode in, flanked by two dozen loyalists in full house armour, their swords drawn and shields locked. They fanned out with disciplined efficiency, surrounding the hall. The Duke wore full battle regalia, his face a handsome, cold mask of triumph. He smelled of oiled steel, winter mint, and absolute certainty.

“What a touching gathering,” Valerius said, his voice filling the silent hall. “Rats and pigeons, dividing the corpse of a lion.”

Loren stepped forward, his face ashen. “Father. This is not your domain. The Accord—”

“—is a piece of trash signed by traitors and fools,” Valerius interrupted, his eyes sweeping the room with contempt. “The kingdom is in chaos. It does not need a committee. It needs a strong hand. It needs legitimacy. And as the highest-ranking peer not tainted by Guild collusion, that duty falls to me.”

“You’re launching a coup in a granary,” Kael said, his hand resting casually on his sword hilt. “That’s a new low for pomp.”

Valerius’s gaze locked on him. “The sell-sword. The destiny-breaker. You could have been a useful figurehead. But I heard you refused a crown. A man who refuses power is either a saint or an idiot. I don’t believe in saints.” He nodded to his captain. “Secure the Charter. Arrest the signatories for sedition. Kill anyone who resists.”

The guards advanced. The blacksmith hefted his hammer. The tribesmen drew long, curved knives. The scholars huddled together like startled birds.

Kael drew his sword. The rasp of steel was the only answer needed.

But Valerius smiled. It was a thin, cruel thing. “Oh, Kael. Did you think I’d come only with swords?” He gestured behind him.

Through the shattered main doors, a new figure was shoved forward by more guards. Marten. His face was bruised, his hands bound. And beside him, a small, terrified figure—Marten’s young daughter, Lyssa, who’d been playing scribe in a corner. A guard held a dagger lightly at her throat.

Marten’s eyes found Kael’s, filled with a despair deeper than any betrayal. “I’m sorry… I went to him after… I thought he could be reasoned with…”

Valerius had played his final card. Not just force, but the crushing weight of a good man’s mistake and an innocent’s fear.

“Now,” the Duke said, the word soft and final in the torchlight. “Drop your weapons. The game is over. The kingdom is mine.”

The hook of the dagger glinted against Lyssa’s throat. The hope of the Accord, so painfully born, hung in the balance, strangled not by prophecy, but by the oldest, grimest politics of all.
