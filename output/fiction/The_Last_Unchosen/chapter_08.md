 The chamber trembled. The crack in the floor spread, glowing veins of orange light branching out like a disease. The remaining enforcers fell back, their discipline crumbling as the floor beneath them began to buckle.

Silas, his robes now black with soot and blood, stood in the center of his ruined circle, his face a mask of fury. “You will not deny me!” he screamed at the Scar. “I have spent a lifetime preparing! I have given my soul to this moment!”

The air thickened with the scent of burning metal and charred flesh. Kael’s lungs burned as he inhaled, the acrid smoke coating his throat. He could taste the copper tang of his own blood, thick and metallic, where the dagger had pierced his chest.

“You gave it to a lie,” Kael said, his voice raw. He stepped forward, the bone dagger still in his hand. The weight of it felt different now—heavier, as if the very essence of the Warden’s bloodline had settled into the blade, waiting for its final command.

The World-Scar’s attention turned fully to him. The pressure in his skull became a physical force, pushing him to his knees. “YOU WILL BOW. YOU WILL OPEN. YOU WILL BECOME.”

Kael’s vision swam. The edges of his sight darkened, but he forced himself to stay upright. He could feel the Scar’s hunger, the way it saw him not as a person, but as a shape to be filled, a vessel to be worn. It was the same way he’d felt when the Guild had hunted him, when the false Chosen had tried to kill him. A thing to be used. A thing to be broken.

He looked at Torren’s body, the lifeless eyes staring up at the ceiling. The blood pooling beneath him was dark, almost black in the dim light. Bren lay nearby, his breath shallow and ragged, his fingers twitching against the stone floor. Elara was on her knees, her face streaked with sweat and soot, her eyes burning with defiance. She met his gaze, and in that moment, he saw the unspoken question in her eyes—Why?

He thought of his father, not as a king, but as a man who had tried to make the right choice in a world that didn’t care. He thought of the prophecy, not as a chain, but as a choice.

He stood.

The pressure redoubled. His bones ached. His blood felt like it was boiling. But he stood.

“No,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. Then louder: “No. I choose.”

He turned the dagger in his hand, not towards the Scar, but towards himself. The blade was cold, the bone hilt smooth against his palm. He could feel the magic in it, the ancient power of the Warden’s bloodline, waiting for a command.

“You want a key?” he said, his voice steady. “I’ll give you one.”

He drove the dagger into his own chest.

The pain was a white-hot explosion. His vision went black. He fell to his knees, the dagger still embedded in his flesh, the magic in it roaring to life.

The World-Scar screamed. Not in triumph, but in fury. The chamber shook. The crack in the floor spread, glowing veins of orange light branching out like a disease. The remaining enforcers fell back, their discipline crumbling as the floor beneath them began to buckle.

Silas, his robes now black with soot and blood, stood in the center of his ruined circle, his face a mask of fury. “You will not deny me!” he screamed at the Scar. “I have spent a lifetime preparing! I have given my soul to this moment!”

Kael could feel the magic inside him, the Warden’s power surging through his veins. It burned like fire, but it was a different kind of fire—one that didn’t destroy, but transformed. He could feel the Scar’s presence, its hunger, its desperation. It wanted him. It needed him.

But he was not a key.

He was a lock.

The dagger in his chest pulsed with light, and the Scar recoiled, its form flickering like a dying flame. The chamber trembled, the air itself trembling with the force of the magic. The enforcers screamed as the floor beneath them gave way, their bodies falling into the abyss below.

Silas’s scream turned to a guttural roar. He lunged at Kael, his hands outstretched, his eyes wild with madness. “You will not take this from me!” he snarled.

Kael met his gaze, his own eyes burning with a light that was not his own. “It was never yours to take,” he said, his voice echoing with the power of the Wardens.

The dagger in his chest flared with light, and the Scar’s form flickered like a dying flame. The chamber trembled, the air itself trembling with the force of the magic. The enforcers screamed as the floor beneath them gave way, their bodies falling into the abyss below.
