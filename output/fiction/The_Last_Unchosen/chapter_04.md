Chapter 4: The Volcanic Herald

CHAPTER FOUR: THE VOLCANIC HERALD

The air in the Guild’s counting-house tasted of ink, dust, and the faint, cloying sweetness of decayed mortar. Kael pressed himself against a cold stone wall, the rough-hewn rock snagging on his worn leather jerkin. In his left hand, he clutched a sheaf of vellum ledgers, their pages crackling with the dry, accusatory sound of numbers. In his right, he held a short, brutal blade, its edge still wet from the man in the hallway whose throat was now more suggestion than structure.
Elara’s voice, a tense whisper in his mind via the crude sigil-link she’d etched on his wrist, was fraying. “They’ve sealed the lower gates. The alarum bells are silent. They don’t want the city to know. They want you dead quietly.”

“Charming,” Kael muttered, not bothering to send it back. The mental link was one-way; she could whisper, he could listen. It appropriate.
He’d rejected Valerius’s deal—a lifetime of comfortable silence in exchange for his mark and his tongue—with a thrown dagger that had missed the Guild Master’s eye by an inch and now quivered in the oak paneling behind his head. The ensuing scramble had been less a fight and more a frantic, bloody ballet in a room too full of expensive furniture. He’d grabbed the nearest thing that looked damning—the ledgers from the Ironstrong account, detailing the “acquisition fees” for the last three Chosen Ones and the “tithes” from provinces that had failed to produce suitable candidates. It was a ledger of holy fraud, written in a neat, mercantile hand.
Boots echoed on the flagstones outside the counting-house door. Not the disciplined tread of city guards, but the hesitant, shuffling step of clerks and scholars given sharp objects and orders they didn’t understand. Kael’s mouth twisted. He could almost smell their fear-sweat through the oak.
He didn’t wait for the door. He went for the window—a narrow, arched slit designed for light, not egress. A lesser man would have balked. Kael, who had once squeezed through a sewer pipe clogged with the remains of a failed rebellion, simply exhaled, turned his shoulders, and pushed. Stone scraped skin from his back. The ledgers, shoved down his tunic, crackled in protest. For a heart-stopping second, he was stuck, suspended three stories above a shadowed courtyard, the sounds of the door bursting open behind him. Then he popped free like a cork, dropping into a pile of reeking refuse sacks that broke his fall with a wet, sighing squelch.
The smell was apocalyptic—rotten vegetables, old parchment, and the distinct, metallic tang of chamber pots emptied with haste. He rolled to his feet, filth clinging to him, and scanned the courtyard. A postern gate, small and rusted, stood ajar. The path of the lazy, or the desperate.
He was both.
He was halfway across the cobbles when the world tilted. Not a metaphor. The ground beneath his feet gave a sudden, violent lurch, like a great beast shrugging in its sleep. Kael stumbled, his boots sliding on the slick stones. From the city beyond the Guild’s high walls, a collective gasp rose, followed by the distant, panicked shriek of a horse. A tremor. Deep and wrong.
“Kael!” Elara’s mental voice was sharp. “Did you feel that?”

“Felt it, smelled it, currently wearing it,” he grunted, shoving through the postern gate and into a reeking alley that stank of urine and cheap tallow. “What was it?”

“Not local. Southern quarter. Reports are… confused.”

He melted into the labyrinth of The Capital’s underbelly, the ledgers a cold, hard weight against his ribs. The tremor had done him a favor; the usual rhythms of the city were broken. People stood in doorways, faces pale, looking at the sky as if for answers. The sky, a bruised purple twilight, offered none.
By the time he reached the crumbling tenement they were using as a safe hole, the news was already coiling through the streets like poison in a stream. He found Elara by a soot-stained window, her face illuminated by the guttering light of a beggar’s fire in the square below. She didn’t turn.
“The Southern Wastes,” she said, her voice flat. “Mount Ghulra. It’s awake. It’s… speaking.”

“Volcanoes don’t speak. They vomit.”

“This one is forming words. In ash and fire.” She finally looked at him, her eyes reflecting the distant, uneasy flames. “The World-Scar stirs. And the Guild is presenting its solution.”

She pointed down. In the square, a platform had been hastily erected. Torches flared, held by men in the pristine white-and-gold of the Guild’s guard. And there, being led up the steps, was Loren.
The current Chosen One glanced like a child dressed for a role too large. His ceremonial armor, all polished silver and sapphire inlay, appeared to wear him. His face, handsome in a soft, unformed way, was the color of curdled milk. His father, Valerius, stood just behind him, a hand on his shoulder that looked supportive and felt, Kael knew, like a steel clamp.
A herald’s voice, magically amplified, boomed across the restless crowd. “People of the Capital! Fear not! The earth trembles, but your faith must not! The gods test us, and in their infinite wisdom, they have provided their vessel! The Chosen One will address the calamity!”

Loren was handed a scroll. He fumbled it, nearly dropping it. The parchment crackled in his trembling hands. He stared at the words, his lips moving soundlessly. The crowd’s murmur, which had been anxious, curdle into something else. Doubt. It had a sound, low and wet, like mud shifting.
“He can’t read the script,” Kael said, a dark chuckle forming in his chest.
“He’s panicking,” Elara whispered, her scholarly detachment gone, replaced by a horrified pity.
Loren’s eyes darted to his father. Valerius’s smile was fixed, a gash of perfect teeth, but his eyes were chips of winter ice. He gave a tiny, brutal nod.
Loren swallowed, audibly even from their perch. Hegazedd back at the crowd, at the thousands of faces waiting for salvation, for a miracle, for a sign. He opened his mouth.
“The gods…” he began, his voice a reedy squeak that the amplification magic turned into a humiliating shriek. He flinched. “The gods are… displeased.”

A masterstroke, Kael had to admit. Blame the people. Always a classic.
“Their chosen vessel stands before you!” Loren continued, gaining a shred of confidence from the script’s poisonous logic. “Yet… yet whispers persist! Whispers of false heirs! Of ancient, broken lines!” His voice rose, tinged with a real, frantic hysteria. “This faithlessness… this heresy… it is a poison in the ear of the world! And the world… the world convulses!”

The crowd rippled. Heads turned, not toward the distant south, but inwards, at their neighbors. The Guild Master’s narrative was a seed finding fertile, frightened soil.
Valerius stepped forward, gently taking the scroll from his son’s limp hands. His voice, when it came, was a soothing, deep contrast. “The Chosen One has spoken the hard truth. The World-Scar awakens not by chance, but because our unity is fractured. We shall pray. We shall renew our tithes to bolster the holy guard. And we shall root out the source of this discord.” His gaze swept the crowd, and for a heartbeat, Kael those eyes pass over their window like a physical chill. “The true heir heresy ends tonight.”

The hook was set. The disaster was no longer a natural catastrophe; it was a religious one. And Kael, the man with the mark, was its architect.
“We need to be gone,” Elara replied, pulling back from the window.
“Further than gone,” Kael replied, tossing the filthy ledgers onto a rickety table. “We need to see it. The source.”

“The Southern Wastes? That’s suicide. The Guild will have agents, the lands are lawless…”

“Which is why we need a guide who thrives in lawless places.”

Her contact was a man named Torren, who operated out of a tavern that smelled of fish guts, sour ale, and existential despair. He was a slab of muscle gone slightly to softness around the middle, with a beard that looked like a bird’s nest and eyes the color of old flint. He listened to Elara’s proposition—passage south, no questions asked, payment in silver and one of the uncut gemstones she’d pried from a temple icon—while cleaning his nails with a wicked-looking dirk.
“Mount Ghulra,” he grunted, finally. “You’re not pilgrims. Pilgrims have a brighter look about ‘em. You’re the other thing.”

“What other object?” Kael asked, sipping the foul ale just to have something to do.
“The ones who think the truth is at the bottom of a smoking hole in the world.” Torren spat on the sawdust floor. “It’s not. It’s simply ash and death. But my boat sails where the coin is. We leave on the tide. Don’t be late. And if you’re followed, I never met you.”

The journey down the coast was a study in grim monotony. Torren’s boat, The Sullen Maiden, was as cheerful as its name. They slept in the hold between crates of dubious cargo, lulled by the groan of timbers and the scent of salt and rot. Torren spoke little, but his eyes missed nothing. He watched Kael with the detached interest of a man assessing a dangerous animal.
On the third morning, the air changed. It grew thick, acrid. The clear blue sky hazed over with a yellowish-brown smear. Asto fall, a gentle, grey snow that coated the decks and stuck in their throats.
“Ghulra’s breath,” Torren said, his usual grumble softened by something like awe. “She’s in a mood.”

By the time they made landfall at a desolate fishing outpost that was more ghost town than port, the world had turned monochrome. Ash fell steadily, muffling all sound. The sun was a dull copper coin behind the veil. They bought miserable-looking donkeys from a man with ash-caked tears perpetually cutting tracks through the grime on his face, and headed inland.
The land was a corpse. Leafless, twisted trees stood like blackened skeletons. The ground was a layer of soft, choking grey over harder, older rock. The air burned with sulfur. They tied rags over their mouths and noses, but the taste of the fire-mountain was inescapable, a constant, rotten-egg promise of oblivion.
They saw it first as a glow on the horizon, a hellish sunrise in the wrong part of the sky. Then, as they crested a barren ridge, the World-Scar unveiled itself.
Mount Ghulra was not a mountain in any sane sense. It was a wound. A vast, jagged rent in the earth, miles across, from which not one but a dozen fiery vents spewed columns of smoke and molten rock. The land around it was a bubbling, cracking nightmare of black glass and slow lava flows. The sound was a deep, planetary groan, a bass note that vibrated in their teeth and bones.
“Gods above,” Elara breathed, her scholarly composure shattered.
“Doubt they’re listening,” Kael coughed, ash coating his lips.
They watched, helpless and small, as a larger vent on the eastern rim swelled, bulged, and then detonated. A plume of fire and ash rocketed skyward, a towering, spreading pillar of destruction. But it was what happened next that froze the blood in their veins.
The wind caught the plume, shearing it into strange, turbulent shapes. And for a fleeting, impossible moment, the ash and superheated air coalesced. It formed a vast, nebulous shape that strode across the sky—a giant of swirling cinder and gloom, with pits for eyes and a mouth open in a silent roar. It took two colossal steps, its form rippling and re-forming with the wind’s whim, before it dissolved back into chaotic smoke. A heartbeat later, another plume birthed a different form: a great, writhing serpent of ash, coiling and uncoiling before it too was torn apart.
They were not living things. They were echoes. Impressions. Like a memory of monsters, stamped onto the world by the sheer, mindless power of the eruption.
“The Herald,” Elara whispered, her voice raw with terror and a terrible, rapturous understanding. “It’s not just an eruption. It’s showing us what sleeps beneath. It’s showing us the Scars.”

Kael could only stare. This was no problem for a boy in pretty armor to solve with prayers and tithes. This was the earth itself turning inside out, vomiting up the nightmares it had digested eons ago. The sheer scale of it made the Guild’s machinations, his own mark, even the concept of a “Chosen One,” seem like children squabbling over painted sticks in the face of a tidal wave.
Torren, who had seen many terrible things, simply bowed his head and made a sign against evil, his flinty eyes wide. “No boat goes closer than this,” answeredaid, his voice final. “You want to dance with that, you do it on your own.”

As the ash-giant faded, its final, dissipating roato whisper on the scorched wind. It wasn’t a language of men. It was older. It was hunger. And it was waking up.
Kael peered from the dissolving monstrosity in the sky to his own hands, to the faint, stubborn outline of the sigil on his wrist—the mark of a lineage meant to fight this. A lineage he never asked for, in a world where the chosen were fake and the real evil didn’t care about prophecies, only consumption.
The hook was no longer the Guild’s lies. It was the mountain’s truth. And it was screaming.
