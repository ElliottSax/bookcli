 with a vaulted ceiling that echoed with the footsteps of the past.

The throne itself was a monstrosity of carved oak and gilded iron, a seat fit for a king. But it was empty, the Duke nowhere to be seen. Instead, a man in a blood-red doublet stood before them, his fingers drumming impatiently on the armrest. His face was a mask of arrogance, his lips curled in a sneer that never quite reached his cold, calculating eyes.

“Kael Arvand,” the man said, his voice dripping with false warmth. “We’ve been expecting you.”

Kael’s jaw tightened. He recognized the man—Lord Aldric, one of Valerius’s most loyal lackeys. The kind of man who thrived in the chaos of upheaval, who saw opportunity where others saw ruin.

“Save the theatrics, Aldric,” Kael said, his voice low and dangerous. “Where’s Valerius?”

Aldric’s smirk widened. “The Duke is otherwise occupied. But he sent me to convey his… gratitude for your assistance in dismantling the Guild.”

Elara’s fingers tightened around the notebook in her hands, her knuckles whitening. “You think we did this for you?”

Aldric’s gaze flicked to her, dismissive. “I think you did it for yourselves. And now, the Duke offers you a place at his side. A reward, if you will, for your… contributions.”

Kael’s hands clenched into fists. The air in the room was thick with tension, the kind that prickled the skin and set the teeth on edge. He could feel the weight of the past pressing down on him, the ghosts of the Prophecy whispering in the shadows.

“No,” Kael said, the word sharp as a blade. “We didn’t do this for him. And we’re not here to be his pawns.”

Aldric’s smile faltered, just for a moment, before he recovered. “Then what are you here for?”

Kael stepped forward, his boots echoing against the marble floor. “To remind him that the world doesn’t belong to him. Not anymore.”

The silence that followed was heavy, suffocating. The air was thick with the scent of old blood and polished wood, the kind of smell that clung to the walls of power. Kael could feel the weight of the past pressing down on him, the ghosts of the Prophecy whispering in the shadows.

Aldric’s eyes narrowed, his fingers tapping a slow, deliberate rhythm against the armrest. “You’re making a mistake,” he said, his voice low and dangerous. “The Duke is not a man to be crossed.”

Kael met his gaze, unflinching. “Neither am I.”

The door to the throne room burst open, and Duke Valerius himself strode in, his boots clicking against the marble floor. He was a tall man, broad-shouldered and imposing, with a face that had been carved from stone. His eyes were cold and calculating, the kind of eyes that saw everything and gave nothing away.

“Kael Arvand,” Valerius said, his voice a deep, resonant baritone. “It’s been a long time.”

Kael’s jaw tightened. He hadn’t seen Valerius in years, not since the Duke had tried to manipulate him into becoming a puppet for his own ambitions. The memory was a bitter one, a wound that had never fully healed.

“Too long,” Kael said, his voice tight.

Valerius’s lips curled into a smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “I hear you’ve been busy. Dismantling the Guild, no less. A bold move.”

Kael’s hands clenched into fists. “It wasn’t for you.”

Valerius’s smile widened. “No, I suppose it wasn’t. But the result is the same. The Guild is gone, and the kingdom is in chaos. And in chaos, there is opportunity.”

Kael’s eyes narrowed. “What do you want, Valerius?”

The Duke’s smile faltered, just for a moment, before he recovered. “I want what’s best for the kingdom. And right now, that means stability. Order.”

Kael’s lips curled into a sneer. “Order? You mean control.”

Valerius’s eyes flashed with anger, but he quickly regained his composure. “Call it what you will. The fact remains that the kingdom is in turmoil, and someone must step forward to restore order.”

Kael’s hands clenched into fists. “And you think that someone is you.”

Valerius’s smile was cold, calculating. “I think I am the only one capable of it.”

Kael’s jaw tightened. “You’re wrong.”

Valerius’s eyes narrowed. “Then who will take my place? You?”

Kael’s hands clenched into fists. “No. But I won’t let you take advantage of the chaos either.”

Valerius’s smile widened. “Then we are at an impasse.”

Kael’s eyes narrowed. “No. We’re not.”

The air in the room was thick with tension, the kind that prickled the skin and set the teeth on edge. Kael could feel the weight of the past pressing down on him, the ghosts of the Prophecy whispering in the shadows.

Valerius’s eyes narrowed. “Then what do you propose?”

Kael’s hands clenched into fists. “I propose that you step down. That you let the kingdom find its own way, without your interference.”

Valerius’s lips curled into a sneer. “And if I refuse?”

Kael’s eyes narrowed. “Then I will make you.”

The silence that followed was heavy, suffocating. The air was thick with the scent of old blood and polished wood, the kind of smell that clung to the walls of power. Kael could feel the weight of the past pressing down on him, the ghosts of the Prophecy whispering in the shadows.

Valerius’s eyes narrowed. “You’re making a mistake, Kael. I am not a man to be crossed.”
