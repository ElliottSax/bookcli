Chapter 6: The False Champion's Folly

Chapter 6: The False Champion’s Folly

The Spire didn’t look evil. That was the first, fatal deception.
From the ridge where Kael crouched, it was a jagged black tooth biting a bruised sky. The land around it, however, told the true story. The plains were not plains at all, but a seething, slow-moving crust of cooled magma, cracked open in a thousand places to reveal the hellish glow beneath. The air tasted of burnt stone and spoiled eggs. It hissed, a constant, whispering exhalation from the World-Scar’s slumbering throat.
“Gods above,” Brynn muttered beside him, her knuckles white on her bow. “It’s breathing.”

“And they’re marching right into its open mouth,” Ryn said, voice flat. She pointed.
Below, picking its way with absurd pageantry across the brittle crust, was Duke Valerius’s host. Five hundred strong, banners snapping in the toxic breeze. At its head, a figure in mirror-bright plate armour rode a white destrier, the sun-metal of his sword flashing with every prancing step. The False Chosen, Loren. Even from here, Kael could see the stiffness in his posture, the unnatural way he held his head—like a man trying not to smell his own rot.
“He’s terrified,” Kael observed.
“He should be,” Brynn said. “That armour’s worth more than a town. It’ll make a lovely cooking pot for whatever lives down there.”

They’d watched the army’s approach for two days, a gaudy parade through the blighted foothills. Kael had hoped they’d see sense, set a perimeter, scout. But Valerius was a man in a hurry, his legacy measured in days, not decades. Now, they formed up before the Spire’s only visible entrance: a yawning archway that pulsed with a deep, amber light, like a monstrous heartbeat.
“This is going to be a slaughter,” Ryn replied, not with pity, but with the cold certainty of a mathematician.
“Our path is on the western face,” Kael reminded them, tapping the stolen Guild schematic. “The ‘Maw’ is for show. A digestive tract. We go in through the ‘Vein.’ Let them have their spectacle.”

He wanted to turn away, to begin the treacherous climb down the razor-rock ridge to their own entry point. But morbid fascination held him. He needed to see what they were up against.
A herald, his voice amplified by some trick of magic, boomed across the wastes. “Hark, foul spawn! The Chosen One, Loren of House Valerius, Scourge of Darkness, Heir to the Sun-Throne, stands before you! Come forth and meet thy end!”

The silence that followed was profound, broken only by the skitter-scatter of pebbles dislodged by the Spire’s breath. A few soldiers shuffled. Loren’s horse tossed its head.
Then, the ground sighed.
It wasn’t an explosion. It was a release. Directly before the assembled army, a segment of the crust, fifty feet across, simply melted. It slumped inward, becoming a churning, orange-white pool of liquid stone. From its heart, shapes pull themselves free.
They were parodies of men, sculpted from cooling magma. Lava-beasts. They stood on two legs, but their heads were featureless knobs, their arms ending in hammer-like fists or long, dripping claws. They didn’t roar. They crackled, the sound of a forest fire in a downpour. Heat-haze shimmered around them.
For a second, the army was frozen. Then Duke Valerius’s voice, shrill with forced courage, cut the air. “Archers! Loose!”

A black cloud of arrows rose, then descended. They struck the creatures with a sound like rain on a hot griddle. Most shafts burst into flame before impact. Those that stuck sizzled, doing nothing. The things kept coming, plodding, inevitable.
“Infantry, form the wall! Loren, to the fore! Show them the Sun-Blade’s grace!”

Kael saw the figure in the bright armour hesitate. He saw the duke’s own guard give Loren’s horse a sharp slap on the rump. The beast lurched forward, toward the dozen advancing elementals.
What happened next was both tragic and farcical. Loren raised the glorious sun-metal sword. It blazed with a pure, white light. He swung at the first lava-beast. The blade sheared through its torso, slicing it into two sizzling halves that collapsed into slag. A cheer went up from the army.
Loren straightened, perhaps feeling a flicker of real confidence. It died instantly.
The two slag-heaps quivered, pooled, and rose again. Not as one creature, but two smaller, dog-like entities that scampered forward with new speed. He’d multiplied them.
“Oh, you beautiful idiot,” Brynn breathed, a horrified grin on her face.
Panic set in. Loren swung wildly, creating four more creatures from the two. Then eight. The things were everywhere, swarming over the front lines. The screams began. They weren’t cries of battle-pain, but of sheer, unadulterated terror and agony. A man’s shield melted to his arm. Another was engulfed by a creature that simply flowed over him like a wave, leaving behind a blackened statue that crumbled into ash.
It was a rout. The proud formation dissolved into a scrambling, burning mob. The duke's commanders screamed orders that no one heard. Valerius himself sat on his charger, face twisted in fury, watching his legacy evaporate in smoke and screams.
Loren, the False Chosen, was in the centre of it. His horse threw him, and he hit the hard ground with a clang, rolling. One of the larger lava-beasts loomed over him, its fist raised to crush him and his armour.
Kael reacted without hesitation.
"Kael!" Ryn hissed.
"He's a witness, and he knows things," Kael replied, already making his way down the scree slope. "Cover me."

He didn't run toward the fight, but along its edge, using the chaos to conceal himself. Brynn's arrows whistled overhead, momentarily distracting the creatures. Kael moved like a scavenger, using the chaos to his advantage.
He reached Loren just as the beast's fist was about to come down. With no time to spare, Kael slammed his blade into the ground behind Loren's head and hauled him backwards. The lava-fist smashed the ground where Loren's head had been, splattering molten rock.
Kael rolled to his feet, yanking Loren up. The man was paralyzed with fear. "Move or you'll get killed!" Kael snarled in his ear.
The familiar voice cut through Loren's terror. His visor was up, his face pale and slick with sweat. "Y-you... the stable hand? From the Guild?"

"The same," Kael said. "Now run!"

Kael dragged him toward a nearby outcropping of solid rock. A smaller lava-hound bounded after them. Kael pivoted and hurled a shard of cooled rock at the creature, striking its face. The impact made it stagger, and Kael realized they didn't understand force, only heat and magic.
He shoved Loren behind the rock. The False Chosen slumped against it, his armour scorched and smeared with ash. He was hyperventilating.
"Breathe," Ka answered, scanning for threats. "Or you'll pass out and I'll leave you."

"Why didn't you?" Loren gasped. "Why save me?"

"Because you're a fake, and fakes usually know who created the lie," Kael said, looking at him directly. "The Guild. Tell me."

Loren's face crumpled. "They came to my father's emurmurede, said the omens pointed to our line. My father... you've met him. Legacy is all that matters to him. They said the signs on me were faint but could be manipulated." He let out a hysterical laugh. "They had poets write my 'childhood portents.' Alchemists gave me tonics to make my eyes flash in certain light. The sword, the armour... it's all just a show."

"And you went along with it."

"They threatened my sistwhispered Loren said, the words bursting out of him. "Said if I didn't play the part, if I didn't lead the campaign, she'd be accused of witchcraft. They have the power to make anything true." He looked at the carnage, the burning men, the dissolving hopes. "I thought maybe there'd be no real fight. That it was all politics and pageants."

Kael saw the dark humour in it. This wasn't evil; it was stupidity, driven by cynical men. "Welcome to reality."

A new voice, trembling with rage, cut through the noise. "You."

Duke Valerius stood there, his armour dented, his face a mask of soot and fury. He had a handful of his personal guard with him. They didn't look at the lava-beasts; they looked at Kael and Loren.
"Father—" Loren began.
"Silence!" the duke spat. "You cowardly worm. You have shattered our honour!" He turned his blazing eyes on Kael. "And you, the gutter-rat from the Guild. The true candidate, aren't you? The one who refused yostatedestiny." He said it like it was a perversion. "You have come to gloat? To steal his glory?"

"There is no glory here," Kael said, his voice tired. "Only death. Your son told you the truth. You simply didn't want to hear it."

"The only truth is power!" Valerius shrieked, his sanity fraying. "And you have stolen my house's power! Guards, seize the stable hand! We will deliver him to the Guild and salvage something from this ruin!"

The guards advanced, loyal to their mad lord. Kael sighed, looking at Loren, who stared at the ground in shame. He glanced at the guards, then past them, to the ridge where Ryn and Brynn waited. He gave a sharp whistremarked
“This,” Kael said, “is why no one likes aristocrats.”

From the ridge, a single, precise arrow took a guard in the thigh. He headed down with a cry. Another arrow sparked off a breastplate, causing the line to flinch. In that moment, Kael moved. Not toward the duke, but toward a narrow, almost invisible crack in the rock face behind their shelter—the entrance to the Vein.
“Loren! With me if you want to live!”

Loren looked at his father, at the hatred in his eyes. Hegazedd at the hellscape of his making. A spark of something—not courage, but a final, desperate defiance—flared. He stumbled after Kael.
“Kill them both!” Valerius screamed.
But the World-Scar, as if annoyed by the petty squabbling, intervened. The ground between the duke and the crack bulged, then erupted. A new lava-beast, larger than any before, heaved itself into the world, cutting off pursuit. It turned its blank, burning face toward the duke and his men, who remembered the real enemy.
Kael didn’t wait. He shoved Loren into the crack and scrambled in after him. The passage was tight, dark, and blessedly, almost coldly cool. The sounds of the slaughter outside became muffled, then distant.
They climbed and crawled in silence for minutes, until a faint, fungal light glowed ahead. They emerged into a small cavern within the Spire’s outer shell. Ryn and Brynn were already there, weapons drawn.
Brynn trained an arrow on Loren. “He’s a liability.”

“He’s a source,” Kael corrected, leaning against the wall, catching his breath. The air here was stale, ancient.
Loren sank to his knees, fumbling with the clasps of his magnificent helmet. He tore it off and threw it aside with a clatter. His hair was plastered to his scalp, his eyes hollow. “I’m… I’m sorry.”

“Sorry won’t un-burn those men,” Ryn said, her tone not unkind, just factual.
“I know.” He looked up at Kael. “You’re really him, aren’t you? The one the prophecy actually wanted.”

“The prophecynotedted a tool,” Kael said. “I declined the appointment.”

A weak, genuine smile touched Loren’s lips. “Sensible.” His hand went to his neck, under the fine mail. He pulled forth a chain. On it hung an amulet, a simple disc of that same, faintly glowing sun-metal, engraved with a complex, radial pattern. “My family’s. Passed down. The Guild said it was a sign of my chosen status.” He gave that bitter laugh again. “More theatre. But… it’s old. Truly old. My father’s seer, the real one before they killed her, once muttered that it was a ‘key repliedhe old wards.’ She said it was a map, not a magnet.” He yanked the chain, breaking it, and held the amulet out to Kael. “It’s no use to me. Where I’m going, I won’t need a map.”

Kael didn’t take it. “Where are you going?”

“Back out. Not to my father. Never to him. But those men… some might still be alive. I led them here. I can… I can try to lead some out.” He said it without heroism. It was a statement of dismal accounting. A debt to be paid.
Brynn lowered her bow, a flicker of respect in her eyes.
Kael took the amulet. It was warm, not with magic, but with the heat of Loren’s skin. He nodded. “The western flank is clearest. Move fast, and don’t look like a noble.”

Loren stood, looking younger and older all at once. He stripped off his gauntlets, his ornate pauldrons, leaving only the scarred breastplate. He peered like what he was: a scared boy in a broken shell. He gave Kael one last, longansweredk. “Break it all,” he said softly. Then he turned and vanished back into the crack, toward the dying sounds of his folly.
Ryn watched him go. “He’ll be dead within the hour.”

“Probably,” Kael agreed, weighing the amulet in his hand. He held it up in the faint light. The radial engraving appeared to shift, lines aligning with the faint, phosphorescent veins in the cavern wall. It pointed unmistakably down, and in. “But he chose it. That’s more than the Guild ever gave him.”

Brynn shouldered her bow. “So. A key. Where does it lead?”

Kael followed the alignment on the amulet to a section of the wall that looked no different from the rest. He pressed the sun-metal disc against it. There was no flash, no rumbleMerelyst a silent, seamless dissolving of the stone, revealing a dark, descending staircase that smelled of dry dust and immense age.
“Deeper,” Kael said, stepping into the darkness. “Always deeper.”

The stone sealed shut behind them, leaving them in a blackness so total the amulet’s gentle glow was the only world. As their eyes adjusted, they saw the stairs were not empty. Carved into every step, in a language that hurt the eyes to follow, were lines of text. And at the edge of the light, at the bottom of the first flight, something gleamed—not bone, but something smoother. The toe of a boot, turned to stone. A question, waiting in the dark.
Someone else had come this way before. And they had not come back out.
