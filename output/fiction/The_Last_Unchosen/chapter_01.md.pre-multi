Chapter 1: The Auction of Fate

The stink of the capital was a layered thing. It began with the river, a sluggish, brown god that smelled of dead fish and wet rot. Then came the smoke from a thousand cookfires, laced with cheap incense from the Temple District to mask the smell of open sewers. Finally, there was the scent of the crowd itself—unwashed wool, sour ale, and a feverish, coppery anticipation. It was the smell of a city waiting for a savior it didn’t believe in, sold by priests it didn’t trust.

Kael leaned against a grimy wall in a shadowed alcove, the rough stone biting through his worn leather jerkin. From here, he had a perfect, depressing view of the Plaza of Whispers and the auction block at its center. He wasn’t here for the spectacle. He was here because a man with a purse full of silver had asked him to stand in a specific spot and look menacing for three hours. It was honest work.

“Look at them,” a voice muttered beside him. The scholar, Elara. Her coin had bought his scowl. She was a slight woman, wrapped in dun-colored robes that had seen better libraries, with ink stains on her fingers and a permanent furrow between her brows. She wasn’t watching the crowd; she was watching the priests. “Vultures in velvet.”

“They’re just doing business,” Kael said, his voice a low rasp. “Like everyone else.”

The business of the day was the Auction of Fate. Every generation, the High Oracle had a vision. A child would be born under a specific constellation, marked for greatness, destined to undertake the Ceremonial Quest to reaffirm the Covenant with the old gods and ensure another fifty years of… well, not peace. Managed decline. The child, once identified, was raised in temple luxury, trained in noble combat, and fed a steady diet of their own divinity. Then, on their eighteenth birthday, they were put up for auction. The highest-bidding noble house got to ‘sponsor’ the Chosen One, basking in the reflected glory and political capital, while the temple coffers swelled. It was the world’s most expensive wedding planner service, with more swords.

A fanfare of silver horns, tarnished at the bells, cut through the din. The High Oracle, a skeletal man draped in enough white silk to sail a ship, emerged onto the balcony of the Sanctum overlooking the plaza. His voice, amplified by some trick of acoustics or magic, rolled over the masses.

“People of the realm! Rejoice! The Wheel of Destiny turns! The Scion of the Twin Stars has been found, nurtured in grace, and is prepared to embark upon the Sacred Journey!”

The crowd cheered. It was a dry, obligatory sound, like gravel being shaken in a sack. They were here for the free wine the noble houses were distributing, and the chance to see some rich bastard spend a fortune.

The Chosen One ascended the auction block. His name was Corvin, son of… well, it didn’t matter now. He’d be Corvin of House Whoever-Won by sunset. He was a beautiful boy, Kael had to give the temple that. Tall, broad-shouldered, with hair the color of wheat and eyes like a summer sky. His armor was polished silver, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, utterly useless for anything but looking divine. He held a ceremonial sword aloft, his face a mask of serene, vacant purpose. He’d been trained to look like that. Kael had once guarded a sculptor who made temple statues; they had the same empty, pious expression.

“He looks like he’s constipated,” Kael muttered.

Elara let out a sharp, unscholarly snort. “He’s been told his every bowel movement is part of a celestial plan. It’s a lot of pressure.”

The auction began. The auctioneer, a jolly, red-faced priest with a voice like a carnival barker, started the bidding at a sum that could have fed the city’s beggars for a decade. The great houses, ensconced in their shaded pavilions, began their dance. Duke Valerius, a man whose jowls seemed to defy gravity, nodded imperiously. Countess Isolde, sharp as a stiletto, countered. Lord Braydon, who smelled of cinnamon and corruption, waved a perfumed handkerchief.

“They’re not buying a hero,” Elara whispered, her eyes fierce. “They’re buying a license. A license to raise taxes in the name of ‘quest support.’ To move troops under the banner of ‘protecting the Divine.’ To silence rivals by questioning their faith in the Chosen’s cause.”

“You say that like it’s a revelation,” Kael said, watching a servant refill Duke Valerius’s wine goblet with something that shimmered purple. “It’s just politics with better lighting.”

The bidding soared into the realm of the absurd. Palaces, trade routes, entire vineyards were offered as collateral. Corvin stood unmoving, a gilded statue sweating in his own destiny.

“And what does your research say about all this?” Kael asked, more to pass the time than out of interest.

“It says,” Elara said, her voice dropping so low he had to lean in, “that this is all a very expensive, very bloody farce. The prophecy is real, Kael. Or it was. But the words… the words have been changed.”

Before he could ask what that meant, the auction climaxed. With a final, thunderous bid that involved the mineral rights to three mountains and a standing army, Duke Valerius prevailed. The crowd roared, this time with genuine feeling. Valerius’s men began throwing stamped copper coins into the masses, causing a violent, scrambling frenzy. The Duke waddled to the block, placed a chain of office around Corvin’s neck, and raised their joined hands. The new Chosen One of House Valerius smiled a perfect, temple-trained smile. Kael saw the boy’s eyes dart to a blonde girl weeping prettily in the Countess Isolde’s pavilion. So much for celestial love.

“Spectacle’s over,” Kael said, pushing off the wall. “Your three hours are up. Pleasure doing business.”

“Wait.” Elara’s hand, surprisingly strong, gripped his forearm. Her eyes weren’t on the plaza anymore; they were scanning the rooftops, the alley mouths. “The job’s not done. I need you to get me back to my lodgings. And then… I may need to leave the city. Quickly.”

Kael sighed. He knew that look. It was the look of someone who’d poked a hornet’s nest with a stick and was just hearing the buzz. “The extra-coin-up-front kind of quickly, or the we’re-probably-going-to-die kind of quickly?”

“The second one,” she said, without a hint of irony. “But I can pay. I have resources.”

He believed her. She had the desperate, focused energy of the truly obsessed, and the obsessed often had patrons. “Fine. But my rates for probable death are steep. Tell me what’s so dangerous about old books.”

“Not here.”

Her lodgings were in the Scholars’ Quarter, a slightly less foul-smelling warren of leaning timber-framed buildings. Her room was a disaster of parchment, scrolls, and leather-bound codices. It smelled of dust, old glue, and a faint, sweet hint of decay. She bolted the door behind them, then immediately began pulling tomes from a shelf, revealing a small iron strongbox.

“The prophecy,” she said, working the combination. “The one they recite every generation. ‘When the Twin Stars bleed into the Lion’s Heart, a child marked by the Crescent and the Storm shall arise. Through trial of blood and truth, they shall walk the Unseen Path and mend the Broken Covenant.’ You’ve heard it?”

“Who hasn’t? It’s on the tavern signs. Makes for a good drinking game.”

“It’s wrong.” She opened the strongbox and withdrew not a book, but a fragment of what looked like dark clay tablet, sealed in a square of clear, hard resin. She handled it with reverence. “This is a kiln-fired shard from the original Tablet of Tharos. Pre-dates the Temple’s founding by five centuries. Recovered from a midden heap in the old city, of all places.” She pointed to a line of jagged, angular script. “The temple translation says ‘marked by the Crescent and the Storm.’ A poetic allusion to a birthmark, they say. But this… the old script is more literal. It doesn’t say ‘marked by.’ It s
