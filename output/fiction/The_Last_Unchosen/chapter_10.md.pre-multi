Chapter 10: A World Without Destiny

The north smelled of smoke and unwashed fear.

Kael and Elara crossed the Bleakwood Pass not as returning heroes, but as ghosts. The Guild’s communication stones had gone dark, their magic snuffed out with the Spire’s fall. News travelled the old way now: on the lips of merchants with haunted eyes, in the frantic whispers of refugees huddled around sputtering fires. The words were always the same: Chaos. Seizure. The Lie.

“It’s faster than I thought,” Elara muttered, pulling her cloak tighter against a wind that carried the greasy tang of a distant burning village. Her notebook, fat with damning transcripts from the Spire’s heart, was a lead weight against her ribs. “The scaffolding’s rotten. You kick out one beam…”

“And the whole shit-heap comes down on your head,” Kael finished, his voice gravelly from disuse.

He looked at his hands. They were just hands now. No latent glow, no tremor of borrowed power. The absence was a constant, hollow ringing in his bones. He’d spent his life resenting the destiny he was denied. Now he’d obliterated the very concept, and the resulting silence was terrifying. He’d imagined freedom. This felt like vertigo.

The kingdom of Valeron unfolded before them like a wounded animal. Fields that should have been thick with late-summer wheat were trampled by the passage of men and steel. Watchtowers stood empty, their Guild-appointed guardians fled. In one hamlet, they saw a crude gallows erected in the square. Three bodies swung, gentle in the breeze. Pinned to one tattered tunic was a scrap of parchment: LIAR.

“Guild tax-collector,” a grizzled old woman spat from her doorstep, noting Kael’s gaze. Her eyes were milky with cataracts, but her aim with her spittle was true. “Come to tell us the sky was green and the earth flat, he did. My grandson, fool boy, believed him. Died in the south for a story.” She turned her clouded eyes towards them. “You selling new stories?”

“No,” Kael said, the word ash in his mouth. “No new stories.”

They pushed on.

The capital, Crown’s Rest, was a fever dream. The soaring white marble of the Guild’s chapterhouse was a blackened shell, its windows like screaming mouths. The grand plaza, where generations of Chosen had been paraded before adouring crowds, was now a fractured mosaic of shouting matches and makeshift camps. A preacher with wild eyes stood on the plinth of a toppled statue, screaming about divine punishment. A group of merchants in fine, now-filthy velvets argued over a map, drawing and redrawing borders with charcoal. A cluster of former Guild acolytes, their blue robes traded for drab grey, huddled together, looking like children who’d burned down their house while playing with fire.

And everywhere, the sigil of the white hawk: Duke Valerius’s standard. It flew from the battlements of the inner keep, a place he had no right to occupy.

Getting into the keep was disturbingly easy. The guards at the gate wore Valerius’s livery but had the desperate look of hired thugs. They recognized Kael, not with reverence, but with a kind of greedy curiosity, like miners spotting a new seam of ore. They were ushered into the throne room, a cavernous space that felt like a gutted beast.

Duke Valerius had not waited for a crown. He sat on the Sunwood Throne, a monolithic thing carved from a single, ancient tree. He looked older, the lines on his face deepened into crevices of calculated grief. His son, Bryndon, the true Chosen, was dead in the south. Kael had seen him fall, a Guild puppet with a Guild dagger in his back.

“Kael the Unchosen,” Valerius’s voice boomed, hollow in the vast room. He didn’t rise. “Or do you prefer ‘Kael the World-Scarred’? ‘Kael the Breaker’? The balladeers are busy, but they haven’t settled on a title yet.”

“Your Grace,” Kael said, the title sticking in his throat. He felt Elara tense beside him, her scholar’s mind already cataloguing the usurpation in the room.

“Spare me.” Valerius waved a hand, a heavy signet ring glinting. “The formalities are dead with the Prophecy. You look tired. You’ve come a long way to see the mess you made.”

“The mess was always here,” Elara said, her voice clear and sharp as a scalpel. “We just removed the painted canvas that hid it.”

Valerius’s eyes, the colour of flint, slid to her. “The scribbler. You carry the proof, they say. The great Lie, written down. Do you know what happens when you show people the monster under the bed? They don’t thank you. They either scream the house down or set the bed on fire.” He leaned forward. “My son died a hero. The people believe that. It is a clean story. A noble story. It gives them something to hold onto in this… this absence you’ve created.”

Kael felt the old, hot anger stir. “He died a pawn. Murdered by his masters when he stopped being useful. You’d wrap your ambition in his shroud?”

“Ambition?” Valerius laughed, a dry, cracking sound. “This is order. Someone must hold the centre. The eastern barons are massing troops. The river-folk are talking of a republic, gods rot them. The Guild’s remnants scuttle in the shadows, trying to broker pieces of their remaining power. Without a Chosen, without the Prophecy, we have only one currency left: force. And I,” he said, settling back, “have the most.”

“So you’ll be a king built on a dead son and a dead lie,” Kael said.

“I’ll be a king who prevents this realm from eating itself alive. You broke the world, boy. I am simply trying to glue it back together before the blood gets too deep.” He looked at them with a chilling practicality. “You have a choice. Give me the scribbler’s proof. Let me control the narrative of the Lie. You can fade away, live your… freedom. Or,” he said, his voice dropping, “become a symbol of opposition. And be removed.”

The threat hung in the air, mingling with the dust motes in the slanted light. Kael saw the guards’ hands on their hilts. He was good with a blade, but he wasn’t that good. Not anymore.

“The truth isn’t yours to control, Your Grace,” Elara said, her chin high. “It belongs to everyone. And they will have it.”

They left the keep not as guests, but as prisoners granted parole. The city outside was a pressure cooker, and Elara held the match.

She published her findings the next day.

She didn’t go to a printer. She went to the street-corner ranters, the ballad-singers, the washerwomen at the public wells. She gave copies to a disillusioned Guild archivist who wept as he read them. She pinned pages to the doors of the burnt-out chapterhouse. The True Account of the Chosen Fraud, & the Sacrificial Wardenship of the World-Scar spread through Crown’s Rest like plague, but a plague of clarity.

Kael watched from the shadowed upper room of a fugitive’s tavern. The reaction was not unified. It was a fracturing.

In the plaza, a burly smith, his face purple with rage, burned a page of the Account. “Lies! Filthy southern lies! The Chosen saved my village from the Scourge-wolves! I felt his light!”

Next to him, a gaunt woman clutched the papers to her chest, tears cutting clean lines through the grime on her face. “My boy… they took my boy for the ‘Trials’. Said he wasn’t pure enough. We starved ourselves to pay the testing tithe. He was just hungry.” Her wail was a raw, terrible thing. “He was just a hungry boy!”

A former Guild knight, his armour stripped of insignia, tried to address a growing crowd. “The corruption was at the highest level! The Grand Master alone perverted the sacred—“

He was pelted with rotten fruit. “You ate from his table!” a fishwife shrieked. “You wore the blue and took our coins for ‘blessings’!”

A philosopher, perched on a fountain, argued loudly with himself and anyone in earshot. “Don’t you see? It’s magnificent! We are unscripted! No destiny, no pre-ordained doom! We can be anything! We are free to be glorious… or to be utterly, uniquely damned!”

Fights broke out. Denial, rage, grief, a wild, anarchic release.
