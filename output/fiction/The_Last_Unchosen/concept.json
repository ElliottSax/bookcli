  "genre": "fantasy",
  "subgenre": "sword and sorcery",
  "premise": "In a world where the 'Chosen One' is a hereditary title auctioned to the highest noble bidder, a cynical mercenary discovers he is the true, prophesied heir. To claim his destiny, he must not only defeat the ancient evil awakening in the volcanic south, but also dismantle the corrupt institution that has weaponized prophecy for centuries. His greatest weapon won't be a legendary sword, but the revelation that the prophecy is a lie.",
  "protagonist": "Kaelen, a jaded sell-sword who specializes in protecting fraudulent 'Chosen Ones' from the consequences of their own incompetence.",
  "conflict": "Kaelen must navigate a web of political intrigue and sacred fraud to confront a genuine apocalyptic threat, all while being hunted by the very church and nobility that profit from the chosen one system he threatens to expose.",
  "setting": "The fractured, iron-rich empires of the Shattered Crown continent, a land of city-states built on ancient ruins, where mercenary companies hold more power than kings and prophecy is a commodity.",
  "tone": "Gritty, morally complex, and darkly humorous, blending visceral action with a deconstruction of chosen one tropes."
