Chapter 4: Unbidden Script

Chapter 4: Unbidden Script

The world returned in a series of slow, sticky blinks. The light from the desk lamp was a physical weight against Leo’s retinas. He was slumped forward, his cheek pressed into the cool, varnished wood of his desk. A line of drool connected his mouth to the surface. He jerked upright, a sharp crick in his neck protesting the movement.

How long?

His monitor had gone to sleep. The room was silent, the perpetual hum of The city outside, perceived as a terrifying, oppressive expanse. muted to a distant sigh. He’d been reading the last of the “Anchoring Points” fragments—the one on obsession, Thorne’s meticulous cataloguing of a specific shade of indigo in a rival’s parlour wallpaper, a colour he claimed could “hold a thought like a fly in amber.” Then, a grey wave of static, a sensation of being gently but firmly pushed aside in his own skull.

He looked down.

Three sheets of pristine, cream-coloured archival paper lay to the right of his keyboard, covered in handwriting. It was not his own. His handwriting was a tense, efficient print, born of a lifetime interfacing with keyboards. This was a flowing, elegant cursive, the kind taught in another century. The ink was the same archival pigment black he used for his own rare notes, but the hand that had wielded the pen possessed a confident, looping grace that made his stomach clench.

He read the first line, and the blood in his veins turned to ice slurry.

“The nature of memory is not storage, but reconstruction. We do not retrieve the past; we build a facsimile of it from available materials. The stronger the materials—the more vivid the pain, the shock, the hunger—the more durable the reconstruction.”

It was verbatim from the diary’s “Anchoring Points: Trauma” section. Word for perfect word. He hadn’t just written it down; he had transcribed it, with a calligraphic precision he could never consciously muster. He flipped the pages. The second sheet continued with the “Sensory Overload” passage, describing Thorne’s experiments with blinding light and deafening sound to “burn the moment into the clay of the soul.” The third page was the “Obsession” fragment, the one about the indigo wallpaper.

Leo’s breath hitched. He hadn’t just copied text. At the bottom of the third page, the script continued past Thorne’s known words. The elegant cursive wrote:

“The indigo is not merely a colour. It is a room. It is the smell of coal dust and rosewater. It is the pressure of the floorboard beneath the rug by the escritoire, the one that squeaks. It is the taste of Earl Grey gone cold. A point is not an idea. It is a world. To anchor is to own the world.”

He dropped the pages as if they’d grown teeth. They fluttered to the floor. This wasn’t passive leakage anymore. This was interaction. A dialogue with a ghost, using his own hand as the medium. The transference was no longer something that happened to him. It was something that happened through him.

He stumbled to the kitchen, needing space, needing a different air. He filled a glass with water, his hands trembling so violently the water slopped over the rim. He drank, the water tasteless, and leaned against the counter, staring at the familiar, safe mundanity of his microwave clock. 3:17 AM. He’d lost nearly four hours.

As he stood there, a familiar, alien scent ghosted past his nostrils: camphor and old, damp wool. It was gone as soon as he registered it, replaced by the smell of his own stale coffee. But the trigger had been pulled.

It wasn’t a vision this time. It was an echo.

A searing, white-hot line of agony scored itself across his left palm. Leo cried out, the glass shattering in the sink. He clutched his hand, staring at it, expecting to see blood, a wound. His skin was unmarked. But the pain was real, vivid, and deeply specific—a precise, surgical cut. As the phantom pain throbbed, the memory-image slammed into him, not in his mind’s eye, but in his very nerves:

Silas Thorne, not in a trance but in fierce, lucid concentration, seated at a mahogany desk. A silver letter-opener, exquisitely crafted, in his right hand. His left palm, upturned on a sheet of blotting paper. His face is a mask of serene focus. He brings the point of the letter-opener down, not in a slash, but in a slow, deliberate push, breaking the skin of his palm. A bead of blood wells, perfect and dark. He does not flinch. A whisper, thick with effort: “To sharpen the spirit’s edge, one must hone it against the whetstone of the flesh. Pain is a lens. It focuses the will.”

Leo gagged, doubling over, his own untouched palm screaming with sympathetic fire. This was no emotional imprint, no vague sensory ghost. This was a memory of deliberate, ritualistic self-harm, delivered in high-definition torment. Thorne wasn’t just feeling; he was doing. And Leo was now, horrifically, reliving.

He spent the next hour in a frantic, silent purge. He gathered the transcribed pages, the beautiful cursive now looking like a poisonous growth. He wanted to burn them. Instead, driven by a archivist’s ingrained taboo against destroying a document, he shoved them into the back of his personal filing cabinet, behind old tax returns, and locked it. He swept up the glass in the sink. He washed his face until his skin was raw. The phantom pain in his palm had faded to a dull, persistent ache, a ghost limb of agony.

He needed to understand the rules. This was a contract, after all. There had to be parameters, limits, small print he’d missed in his avaricious rush. He dragged the locked case containing the remaining diary fragments onto his desk. His hands, still unsteady, worked the combination. He ignored the fragile papers within. Instead, he focused on the modern, administrative documents that had accompanied them—the non-disclosure agreements, the handling protocols, the payment schedules.

He’d skimmed them before. Now, he read them with the desperate intensity of a man reading his own death sentence. The legalese blurred and then snapped into terrible focus. On page 7 of the “Supplementary Conditions” addendum, Clause 12.B, he found it. It was titled “Acknowledgement of Psychological Immersion.”

“The Contractor acknowledges that the Source Material is of an intensely subjective and psychologically nuanced nature. Extended engagement may result in temporary, dream-like states of identification, heightened empathetic response, or the subjective experience of non-original memories. The Contractor hereby waives any claim against the Client for psychological side effects, including but not limited to dissociation, anxiety, or fugue states, arising from the faithful execution of the work, understanding these to be a natural byproduct of deep archival reconstruction.”

“Temporary, dream-like states.” “Subjective experience of non-original memories.” They’d known. The faceless estate, the lawyers, they had known this could happen. They’d couched it in sterile, academic language, buried it in a waiver. “Faithful execution of the work.” Was that what this was? Was his mind being reshaped into a more faithful tool for reconstruction?

He let the page fall. The apartment felt different. The shadows in the corners seemed deeper, more substantive. The hum of his refrigerator wasn’t just a sound; it was a vibration he felt in his molars, a sensory anchor point in his own, modern prison. Thorne’s methods were becoming clear. Trauma: the shock of the transference, the violation. Sensory Overload: the phantom smells, the tactile echoes, the blinding focus on minutiae. Obsession: he was living it, his every thought circling back to the diary, to the case, to the thing coiling in the dark of his own head.

He couldn’t call the client. The NDA forbade unscheduled contact. He couldn’t see a doctor; what would he say? I’m remembering another man’s life so vividly I’m cutting my own hand with his memories? They’d institutionalize him. He was alone. The only entity that understood what was happening was the very thing causing it.

The next two days passed in a fractured haze. Leo slept in fitful bursts, afraid of what he might do in his sleep. He tried to work on other projects, simple digitization jobs, but the pixels on the screen seemed to swim, forming themselves into cursive loops. He’d catch himself staring at his own hand, wondering at its potential for betrayal. The hunger to open the case, to read more, was a physical ache, a craving. Thorne’s obsession had become his own. He was anchoring the presence with every moment of attention.

On the third morning, as a thin, grey dawn bled through his windows, the intercom buzzed. Leo jumped, his heart a trapped bird against his ribs. He wasn’t expecting anything. He padded to the intercom, his mouth dry.

“Yes?”

“Courier delivery for Leo Voss. Needs a signature.” A bored, staticky voice.

A chill, separate from the morning cold, crept up his spine. He hadn’t ordered anything. The client only communicated via the encrypted portal. He buzzed the courier up, the sound unnaturally loud in the tense silence of the apartment.

A minute later, a knock. He opened the door to a young man in a bright jacket, holding a slim, rigid envelope. Leo signed the electronic pad, his name a shaky scrawl. The courier left without a word.

Leo stood in his doorway, holding the envelope. It was high-quality, heavy paper. His name and address were typed on the label in a simple, modern font. No return address. His fingers found the seal. It wasn’t glued; it was closed with a small, black wax seal. The impression was a single, intricate letter: T.

He broke the seal.

Inside was a single sheet of paper. Not old parchment, but contemporary laser-print paper. The text was typed in the same clean, anonymous font as the label.

He began to read, and the floor seemed to tilt beneath him.

“The dwelling is a cube of steel and glass, suspended in the air. It hums with a perpetual, low-frequency song—not the song of bees or machinery, but the song of invisible rivers of data. The air is stale, recycled, carrying the faint, persistent odours of roasted coffee beans, synthetic lemon cleaner, and the ozone of overheating electronics.

“The primary room is dominated by a vast window overlooking a canyon of concrete and light. By day, the world is a muted grey tableau. By night, it becomes a galaxy of artificial stars, their patterns unchanging, a fixed celestial map of human habitation. The desk is the room’s altar: black steel, its surface a chaotic testament to a single focus. A silver laptop, its keys worn smooth in specific places—the ‘S’, the ‘E’, the ‘Delete’. A pen, utilitarian, leaking a slow stain of black into a foam grip. A ceramic mug, chipped on the handle, bearing the residue of countless bitter brews.

“To the left of the altar, a shelving unit. Not wood, but cold, white laminate. It holds not books of paper, but silent, black rectangles—external drives. They are labelled with dates and cryptic codes, the tombs of forgotten thoughts. One shelf is different. It holds a single, incongruous object: a small, carved stone frog, a relic of a childhood holiday, cool to the touch, a tactile anchor to a self that feels increasingly theoretical.

“The lighting is always wrong. The overhead light is too harsh, revealing every fingerprint and dust mote. The desk lamp casts a pool of yellow that feels like a stage, leaving the corners of the room in profound, watchful darkness. The floor is a synthetic fibre, beige, trapping the cold. A single, worn path is visible from the desk to the kitchen area, where a stainless steel sink holds the ghost of shattered glass.

“The occupant is male, late thirties. He moves with a careful tension, as if his joints are aware they are being observed. He rarely speaks aloud. His thoughts are a frantic, silent scroll of text against the back of his skull. He is hungry for something he cannot name, and so he consumes information, piece by piece, hoping to find the flavour of it. He is porous. He is an excellent host.”

Leo’s legs gave way. He slid down the wall beside his door, the paper crumpling in his fist. It was his apartment. Described not as an outsider would see it, but as he experienced it. The “song of invisible rivers of data.” The “tactile anchor” of the stone frog from Brighton, a thing no one else knew about. The “ghost of shattered glass” in the sink. The analysis of his own worn path on the carpet. The description of his own thoughts.

It was a new fragment. A diary entry written in the present tense. About him.

His eyes, burning with tears of sheer terror, dragged themselves to the final line, typed alone at the bottom of the page.

“The tenant is settled. The lease is binding.”

From the main room, hidden by the wall he slumped against, came a soft, definite sound. The crisp, metallic click of the combination locks on Silas Thorne’s case snapping open.
