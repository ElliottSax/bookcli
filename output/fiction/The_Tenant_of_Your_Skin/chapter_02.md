The apartment air hung thick with the scent of old paper and the faint metallic tang of the scanner’s ink. Over the keyboard, Leo’s fingers hovered, the cursor blinking impatiently at the next fragment. A hesitation, then a click.

Fragment 24, Séance Log, dated November 12, 1887:
“Subject: Mr. Alistair Voss, widower. Conditions: Poor. The man reeks of brandy and self-pity. His wife’s death was recent—three months, perhaps. He is not ready. He is not listening. He is shouting into the dark, demanding answers. The dead do not answer demands. They whisper. They murmur. They sing. I tried to explain this, but he would not hear. He insisted on the trumpet, the rapping, the theatrical nonsense. I accommodated. The results were predictable. A single, weak rap. A sound like a mouse scuttling in the walls. He called it a ‘sign.’ He was wrong. It was a dismissal. The dead have no patience for fools.”

A sharp exhale fogged the screen. Crisp and precise, the words nonetheless vibrated with a frustration, a barely contained fury. Thorne had been a man on the edge, teetering between discovery and madness. Now, Leo walked that same tightrope, his own mind unraveling with each fragment uncovered.

A dull throb intensified at his temples. The stone’s scent—ozone and damp wool—still lingered in his nostrils, a phantom presence refusing to fade. *Focus. Push through.*

Fragment 25, Personal, dated November 15, 1887:
“I dreamt of the stone again last night. It was warm in my hand, alive with a pulse that was not my own. I could feel the whispers, the echoes of the past, seeping into my skin. I am becoming a conduit. I am becoming a vessel. The dead are speaking to me, and I am listening. I am hearing them. I am understanding. The veil is thin. It is tearing. And I am ready to step through.”

Leo’s hands trembled. The stone. The same stone from his vision. The same stone Thorne had held, connecting him to the other side. Its imagined weight settled in his palm, a cold seeping into his bones. Whispers, murmurs, echoes of the past crowded in.

He stood abruptly, the chair scraping against the floor. Movement was necessary, a way to shake off the sensation. Pacing the room, his footsteps echoed in the silence. The apartment seemed to shrink, walls closing in. The presence of the dead grew, their whispers louder, their voices more insistent.

Stopping before the scanner, his eyes were drawn to the next fragment. Another hesitation, another click.

Fragment 26, Theoretical Musings, undated:
“The body is a prison. It confines the spirit, it limits the mind. It is a barrier, a wall, a cage. But it is not impenetrable. It is not invincible. It can be broken. It can be transcended. The stone is the key. The stone is the door. The stone is the way. And I am ready to step through.”

Breath caught in his throat. A manifesto. A declaration of war. Thorne was not just a man, but a revolutionary, a pioneer, a madman. And Leo followed in his footsteps, stepping into the abyss one fragment at a time.

Turning from the scanner, his eyes scanned the room. Fragments lay everywhere, scattered across the desk, the floor, the walls. A map. A guide. A warning. Proof of Thorne’s obsession, his madness, his genius.

And they called. They whispered. They begged for him to listen, to understand, to step through.

A deep breath did nothing to calm the heart pounding against his ribs. Unready. Unprepared. Not listening. He was shouting into the dark, demanding answers. The dead offered none.

Back at the desk, fingers hovered over the keyboard. *Push through. Keep going. Find the truth.*

A click on the next fragment.

Fragment 27, Séance Log, dated November 18, 1887:
“Subject: Mrs. Eleanor Whitmore, widow. Conditions: Optimal. The air was thick with the scent of lavender and the sound of her quiet sobs. She was ready. She was listening. She was hearing. The stone was warm in my hand, the whispers growing louder, the echoes more insistent. I guided her, not to call out, but to listen in. And she heard. She heard the voices. She heard the whispers. She heard the echoes. She heard the dead. And she wept. She wept for the loss. She wept for the pain. She wept for the love. She wept for the memories. She wept for the past. She wept for the future.
