Chapter 6: Excavation

Chapter 6: Excavation

The rebellion was over. It had lasted, in its final, pathetic form, for the length of a single, shuddering breath. Leo had stood in the shower, the water a scalding punishment, and had tried to will his hand to turn the knob to cold. A simple act of defiance. His muscles had locked, trembling. From within, a wave of pure, unadulterated disappointment had washed over him—not his own. It was the feeling of a master seeing a prized hound soil the carpet. The disappointment was worse than the rage that had preceded his blackouts. It was intimate. It was familial. His hand had turned the water off, obediently, and he had stood there dripping, hollowed out by shame that wasn’t even his to own.
Surrender, then. Not to possession, but to the process. If Thorne was a text, Leo would read him. If he was a mine, Leo would dig. He would go into the echoes, not as a victim flinching from a blow, but as an archaeologist descending into a toxic trench. He needed to find a flaw, a crack in the porcelain psyche of Alistair Thorne. The diary was useless; its structure was a labyrinth designed to educate, not to reveal. The real secrets were in the lived memories, in the emotional scars Thorne had left behind like psychic snail-trail.
He began in the study, as the evening bled into a thick, velvety night. He didn’t fight the compulsion to sit in the high-backed chair. He leaned into it. He opened his mind, not by trying to think of nothing, but by focusing on the one thing he had of Thorne’s: the dry, parchment smell of the diary, the specific grain of the leather binding. He traced the embossed ‘T’ on the cover with his thumb, over and over.
The room didn’t dissolve. It infilled.
First, the smell changed. The underlying notes of dust and old paper were subsumed by the rich, sweet aroma of pipe tobacco—not the chemical stuff from a drugstore, but something dark and complex, like cherries and earth. The light from his desk lamp grew warmer, yellower, its circle on the ceiling shrinking as the flame of an oil lamp guttered in a draft he couldn’t feel. His own books on the shelves appeared to blur, their spines melting and reforming into older, thicker volumes with titles in Latin and embossed gold. The hum of the refrigerator died, replaced by a profound, woolen silence, broken only by the soft, rhythmic scratch-scratch of a nib on paper.
Leo was still in his body, but it like wearing a stiff, unfamiliar suit. His hands—larger, the knuckles pronounced, a smudge of ink on the left index finger—were writing. He was not writing. He was being written. The script was Thorne’s, flowing in elegant, confident lines across a page of creamy, heavy paper.
“The vessel is resistant,” the hand wrote. Leo thought that preceded the words, a cold clinical frustration, like a surgeon encountering an unexpected calcification. “The emotional substrate is tenacious. Fear, in particular, adheres to the basal consciousness with a tenacity I had not calculated. It must be scraped clean, not merely over-written. A lesson for the next.”

A memory, then. Not an echo. A direct recording. Leo was a passenger behind Thorne’s eyes. He tried to turn his head, to look away from the page, but the focus was absolute. The only thing he could control was his own attention, a tiny, silent observer in the cockpit of Thorne’s mind.
Then, a sound. A groan. Low, wet, from the floor to his right.
Thorne’s head lifted, turning with deliberate slowness. The focus shifted, and Leo saw.
It was a man, perhaps forty, in a ruined waistcoat and shirtsleeves. He was on his knees, trembling violently, one hand clutching a Persian rug, fingers digging into the intricate patterns. His face was a mask of sweat and contorted agony, but his eyes… his eyes were the worst. One was a pale, clear blue, wide with terror. The other was a milky, sightless grey, the pupil dilated to a black pit thato suck in the lamplight. The left side of his mouth twitched upwards in a rictus grin; the right side drooled onto the carpet.
“Stop,” the man slurred, the word bubbling from his lopsided mouth. “Alistair… in God’s name… it’s broken.”

Thorne’s feeling was not pity. It was a sharp, analytical disgust. “You are not emptied, Charles,” Thorne’s voice said, and Leo heard it from within the throat, felt the vibration in a larger, older larynx. The tone was that of a tutor correcting a sloppy equation. “You cling to your sentiment. Your love for your dreary little children. It gums the works.”

“They’re… they’re in the walls,” Charles whimpered, his good eye rolling toward the dark oak paneling. “I can hear them laughing. In the walls of my own head.”

“Phantoms. Residuals. They will dissipate once the transfer is complete and I vacate this… compromised medium.” Thorne rose from the desk. Leo power in the body, the surety. But underneath, a thin wire of anxiety. Something was off. The calculation was flawed.
Thorne approached Charles, kneeling before him with a terrible, intimate grace. He placed his hands on either side of the man’s sweating face. “I will finish the extraction. Be still. It is a privilege to house me, even partially.”

Leo push. It was not a physical sensation, but a metaphysical one—a vast, cold pressure exerted from Thorne’s consciousness, a glacier of will sliding into a valley. It sought to displace, to overwrite. But the valley was not empty. It was a ruin, filled with the screaming ghosts of Charles’s shattered mind.
The connection was a sewer pipe bursting open. Leo/Thorne was flooded not with coherent memory, but with raw, shrieking sense: the smell of newborn hair, the crushing weight of a debtors’ prison, the taste of a wife’s lips, the sound of a son’s whooping cough, the visceral, gut-churning fear of God’s judgment. It was a cacophony of a life, jagged and broken, and it pushed back.
Thorne recoiled, physically wrenching his hands away. For the first time, Leo spike of pure, undiluted fear—Thorne’s fear. It was not the fear of pain or death. It was the terror of a fastidious artist splattered with mud, of a pristine instrument dropped into filth. It was the horror of contamination.
Charles collapsed, twitching, a low mewling coming from his throat. The milky eye now wept a thin, clear fluid.
“No,” Thorne whispered, staring at his own hands as if they were diseased. “No, this will not do. A broken medium. A psychic scar.”

The memory shattered. Leo gasped, back in his own chair, in his own study, the modern desk lamp buzzing faintly. He was drenched in a cold sweat, his heart hammering against his ribs. He could still smell the pipe tobacco, layered over the sour tang of Charles’s terror. He could feel the ghost of that psychic recoil in his own mind, a bruise on his soul.
Thorne’s fear, Leo thought, the realization dawning with the clarity of an ice-cold needle. He’s not afraid of dying. He’s afraid of getting stuck. Of being trapped in a mind that isn’t clean, that’s still full of the original owner. A broken medium.
It was a vulnerability, but a terrifying one. It meant Thorne would be meticulous. He would not rush. He would scrape Leo clean with the patience of a restorer on an old painting, ensuring not a speck of the original under-painting remained. Leo’s own memories, his love for Elise, his grief for his father, his anxieties—they weren’t just obstacles to Thorne. They were pollutants. And the process of removing them was the process of unmaking Leo entirely.
He had to go deeper.
The next dive was not into a single memory, but into a stream of them. Leo let the compulsion to ‘organize’ his books take him. As his hands sorted volumes by size and color, a Thorne-echo guided him, and he rode the current backwards into Thorne’s past.
He saw a boy, sickly and sharp-eyed, in a vast, cold nursery, learning that the maids could be bribed with sweets for silence and hair. He saw a young man at Oxford, his fascination with the mind curdling into obsession in dusty libraries, his first, fumbling experiments on stray cats and, later, on a drunken scout who remembered nothing. He Thorne’s burgeoning contempt for the “muddled soup” of ordinary consciousness, his lust for a pure, clean, immortal cognition.
And he saw the failures. Not just Charles. Others. A society woman left catatonic, humming a single nursery rhyme for the rest of her days. A banker who developed a hysterical blindness. Each failure was a lesson, carefully recorded in Thorne’s emotionless calculus. The ‘psychic scar’ of Charles was the worst—a botched transference that left a permanent, screaming knot in Thorne’s own psychic fabric, a place he could not go, a weakness he could not afford. Leo its location in Thorne’s mind-map like a boarded-up room in a vast mansion. A place of dread.
The memories became a torrent. Leo lost days, or perhaps it was hours. He found himself on the kitchen floor, eating cold beans from a can with his fingers, a Thorne-memory of trench rations overlaying the taste. He woke in his bed, his fingers tracing the patterns of the stucco ceiling, seeing instead the water-stained plaster of Thorne’s childhood bedroom. The excavation was tearing him apart. He was becoming the trench.
But in the soil, he found fragments.
A phrase, whispered in a memory of a secret meeting with a fellow occultist: “…the counter-script, of course, is the only prudent safeguard…”

A line, buried in a stream of theoretical musing as Thorne dissected a brain: “…as one inscribes the command, so too must one inscribe the revocation. Symmetry is the law…”

A flicker of intense, focused worry: “…should the vessel prove stronger than anticipated, the script must hold the key to dissolution…”

Counter-script. Revocation. Dissolution.
The words were lifelines, glowing in the murk. They were not part of the textbook in the diary. They were the footnotes, the errata, the secrets Thorne kept from his own masterpiece.
The hook came on the third night, or maybe the fourth. Leo was deep in the most powerful echo yet—Thorne in his prime, standing in his personal library, a room Leo had only glimpsed in fragments. It was circular, with a domed glass ceiling showing a night sky choked with London smog. Books rose in tiers, accessible by a delicate wrought-iron staircase. The air was thick with knowledge and arrogance.
Thorne was agitated. The memory was charged with a rare, seething frustration. A volume was missing. A rare treatise on Paracelsian alchemy. He was pacing, his mind racing through possibilities—a careless servant, a rival’s theft. His gaze swept the shelves, his eyes cataloguing each title with possessive fury.
Leo, the ghost in the machine, let his own eyes drift with Thorne’s. Across the room, on a middle shelf of dark mahogany, a set of matching leather spines caught the gaslight. Thorne’s attention skipped over them, but Leo’s, the silent passenger, snagged.
One title, stamped in faded gold, stood out. It was not like the others in Latin or German. It was in English. A mundane, almost laughable title amidst the occult grandeur.
“The Principles of Sympathetic Resonance: A Treatise on Correspondences.”

The author’s name was obscured by shadow.
The memory flickered, Thorne’s anger shifting to a new target. But Leo clung to the image of that spine. It burned in his mind with a strange, familiar clarity.
He was ejected from the memory violently, retching over his own wastebasket, the taste of Thames water and rage in his mouth. He crawled to his computer, his fingers clumsy. He typed the title into a search engine.
There were results. It was an obscure 19th-century philosophical work, debated and dismissed by serious academics. A dry text about the symbolic connections between all things. A dead end.
Then he saw it. A modern reprint. A small, niche publisher specializing in historical curiosities. He clicked.
The cover of the reprint was a cheap digital rendering of the original leather. The author’s name was clear now: Elias Sower.
And in the ‘Customers Also Bought’ section, linked by the algorithms of a vast online retailer, was a familiar cover. A stark, black-and-white design.
It was his own book. The one he had written. A slim volume of literary criticism on the use of symbolism in late Victorian ghost stories.
The connection was absurd. Meaningless. A coincidence woven by an automated marketing tool.
But in the silent, claustrophobic prison of his own mind, a cell Thorne had not yet fully secured, a thought sparked.
Sympathetic resonance. Correspondences. The link between the symbol and the object. The map and the territory.
Thorne believed in symmetry. In ritual. In precise, symbolic action. The transference was a script. What if the counter-script wasn’t a separate spell, but the original, inverted? Played backwards? What if the key wasn’t in fighting Thorne, but in understanding the rules of his game so completely you could turn them against him?
Leo stood on trembling legs. He walked to his own bookshelf, the modern IKEA one, in his bland, safe living room. His eyes scanned the spines. There, between a book on gardening and a travel guide to Portugal, was his own work. He pulled it out. He had never been prouder of anything.
He flipped to the introduction, to his own words about the power of symbolic objects in fiction—a doll, a ring, a locked room.
Scrawled in the margin, in a handwriting that was an uncanny fusion of his own cursive and Thorne’s elegant copperplate, was a single note he had not written:

“The vessel is also the lock. The key must be fashioned from its own substance. See Sower. p. 212.”

Leo’s blood turned to ice. Thorne was not simply invading him. He was annotating him. Using Leo’s own mind, his own interests, his own work, to build the very tool for his own destruction.
The failsafe was real. But Thorne knew Leo was looking for it. And he was leaving the clues himself.
The excavation was over. Now, the trap was springing.
