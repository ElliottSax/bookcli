Chapter 10: Broken Medium

Chapter 10: Broken Medium

The world didn’t end with a bang, but with a silent, inward fracture.

Leo’s final word—anchor—scratched onto the blank page, wasn’t a word at all in the end. It was a keystone shoved into a crumbling arch. For a heartbeat, there was perfect, resonant silence, a vacuum in the psychic space they fought over. Then the circuit, denied its clean transfer, overloaded.

The backlash wasn’t physical. It was ontological. A psychic shockwave, silent and utterly profound, radiated from the journal, from Leo, from the very walls steeped in their conflict. It was the sound of two tuning forks, forced to the same frequency, shattering each other. Leo felt a tearing, not in his flesh, but in the glue of his self. He saw Thorne’s spectral form not vanish, but implode, a silent scream of ink and moth-dust sucked into a point between his own eyes. Then, nothing.
Consciousness returned not as a rising tide, but as a shattered pane of glass, each shard reflecting a different life.

Leo was on the floor, cheek pressed against wood. But was it his floor? The grain beneath him seemed to swim, one moment the blond oak of his pre-war building, the next the dark, broad planks of a Victorian workhouse, sticky with a residue that smelled of lamp oil and lye. He tried to move his hand and saw two: one pale, long-fingered, ink-stained at the nail; the other, his own, bitten cuticles and the faint scar from a childhood bicycle fall. Both phantoms, both solid, layered over each other.

He groaned, and the sound was a chorus. A young man’s dry-throated rasp. An older man’s wet, consumptive cough. Both from his own throat.

Get up. The thought was clear. But whose?

He pushed, staggered, fell against the wall. The wallpaper bled. His cheap, cream-colored anaglypta melted like wax, revealing beneath it a rich, damask pattern of burgundy and gold, thick with the smell of old paste and coal smoke. A gas sconce flickered into existence beside his head, its flame casting a warm, dancing glow that overlaid the static, cold light from his LED bulb. The room was a double exposure, a photographic accident where two eras occupied the same space, neither fully yielding. His IKEA bookshelf was there, but its shelves also seemed to hold leather-bound ledgers and specimen jars. The hum of his refrigerator harmonized with the distant, rhythmic clack-clack of a mechanical loom that came from nowhere and everywhere.

“No,” he whispered.

Yes, the whisper echoed back, inside his skull.

It was Thorne’s voice. It was his own voice. It was a new voice, a blended thing that carried the cadence of both.

The cacophony began. Not as sound, but as memory. He was hunched over his laptop, coding until his eyes burned. Simultaneously, he was hunched over a drafting table, sketching the precise, obsessive anatomy of a beetle, his back aching in a stiff woolen waistcoat. He felt the phantom weight of headphones on his ears and the pinch of wire-framed spectacles on his nose. He remembered his mother’s face, warm and laughing; and he remembered a different woman, stern in black bombazine, her face a faded daguerreotype. The first kiss with Maya by the college gardens—the scent of jasmine and her shampoo. The first, furtive touch of a pallid factory girl in a soot-choked alley—the smell of sweat and cheap gin.

“Stop,” he begged, clutching his head. His fingers dug into hair that felt both too short and unnervingly long, brushing a collar that was both cotton tee and stiff linen.

We cannot, the interior voice replied. It was calm, horrifically so. The vessel is one. The contents are two. The mixture is… unstable.

“We’re not a mixture. We’re a crash.”

Semantics. The ritual is complete, yet incomplete. A broken medium. A short circuit of souls.

Leo stumbled towards the bathroom, the only room that might still hold a singular truth. The corridor seemed to stretch and compress, the floorboards groaning with two centuries of footfalls. He pushed the door open.

The mirror showed his face. His own, familiar, tired face. The relief was a sob in his throat. But then the face in the mirror moved. He blinked. The reflection’s right eye blinked a fraction of a second later. He frowned. The left side of the reflection’s mouth twitched, independent of the right. It was like watching a poorly synced film. His own features, puppeteered by two separate, arguing hands.

“What have we done?” Leo’s voice asked.

What you forced us to, Thorne’s tone answered, using the same vocal cords. A mausoleum for two.

The reflection’s right eye—his eye—welled with a tear of panic. The left eye, the same hazel green, held only a cold, analytical curiosity. One side of the face was a mask of despair; the other, a mask of grim fascination. They were one face. They were his face.

“I’m still here,” Leo insisted to the mirror.

And I am not gone, the interior voice answered. We are a palimpsest. You are the vellum. I am the ink that cannot be scraped away. We read each other, now. In perpetuity.

The horror of it was not in violence, but in intimacy. He could feel the ghost of Thorne’s memories like a second nervous system. The craving for strong, sweet tea. The automatic, judgmental assessment of the room’s “vulgar” modernity. The deep-seated, bone-level terror of empty spaces—agoraphobia not of places, but of existential solitude. And beneath it all, the humming, obsessive frequency of the Collection: the need to categorize, to own, to preserve.

And he knew, with a sickening lurch, that Thorne was experiencing the same. The fleeting, colorful chaos of the internet. The taste of artificial sweetener. The profound, un-Victorian comfort of central heating. The memory of his father leaving, a hollow 21st-century ache that Thorne found both pathetic and fascinatingly novel.

They were trapped in the most intimate prison imaginable: each other.

The phone rang. The sound was a lifeline to the outside, singular world. He lurched back into the main room, where his phone buzzed on the coffee table—a table that also appeared to be a heavy, oak writing desk littered with quills. He snatched it up.

“Leo?” It was Aris’s voice, but stripped of its usual clinical detachment. It thrummed with a fervent, reverent energy. “Leo, are you there? Are you… whole?”

“Aris?” Leo’s voice was a shaky compound. “Something’s wrong. It’s not… he’s not gone. I’m not… we’re…”

“The sensors,” Aris interrupted, breathless. “We’ve never seen readings like this. A perfect resonance. The dissonance is gone. The Thorne-signature and your bio-electric field… they’ve achieved harmonic convergence. It’s stable. It’s beautiful.”

“Stable?” Leo barked a laugh that turned into a cough. “I’m looking at a room from 1893! I have two sets of memories! That’s not stable, that’s catastrophic!”

“Persistent spectral overlay is a known side-effect of successful deep integration,” Aris said, his voice dripping with awe. “The mind, the very soul, is reconciling the new data. The environment reflects the reconciled psyche. Don’t fight it, Leo. You’ve done it. You’ve completed the Collection. You are the living record. The final, perfect medium.”

Leo’s blood ran cold. They saw this as success. The ultimate act of preservation: not a book, not a ghost, but a living, breathing archive. A tenant who was the house.

“You have to help me,” Leo pleaded, desperation cracking the compound voice. “There has to be a reversal. An extraction.”

“Extraction?” Aris sounded genuinely puzzled. “Why would we extract? The Foundation’s purpose is preservation. We preserve that which is unique, that which transcends its time. You… you now transcend time. You are Thorne, perfectly preserved in a contemporary vessel. And you are Leo, granted a profundity of experience no other human possesses. You are our greatest achievement.”

The call wasn’t for help. It was for worship.

“Don’t call again,” Leo whispered.

“We will monitor. We will provide any support the Archive requires,” Aris said, and the line went dead.

Leo dropped the phone. It clattered on the oak/particle board. He was alone. Or rather, they were alone.

They see us as a success, Thorne’s thoughts mused within their shared space. The tone wasn’t triumphant. It was as claustrophobic as Leo’s own. A museum exhibit with a pulse. We are a wonder, and a tragedy.

“We need to separate,” Leo said aloud, pacing. His gait was uneven, one leg moving with his own casual slouch, the other trying to adopt a more rigid, upright posture. He was a marionette with two pilots.

The ritual is spent. The medium is fused. There is no ‘you’ or ‘I’ to separate. Only ‘we.’ The Foundation is correct in that, if nothing else.

“No,” Leo said, sinking into his sofa, which also felt like a hard, horsehair-stuffed settee. “There has to be a way. A… a psychic surgery. Something.”

To cut me out would be to lobotomize yourself, Thorne’s inner voice reasoned. It was terrifyingly logical. My memories, my patterns, are woven into your neural pathways. Removing them would leave you a hollowed-out shell. And vice versa. We are, as you might say, co-dependent.

The truth of it settled in the room, as solid as the overlapping furniture. They were stuck. A perpetual, intimate haunting. Every thought would be overheard. Every memory would have a footnote. Every emotion would be a duet.

Days bled into a timeless, internal struggle. Leo would try to make coffee, and his hands would fumble, one reaching for the French press, the other instinctively seeking a kettle and a tin of loose leaves. He’d put on music—something loud and electronic to drown out the noise in his head—and a deep, visceral revulsion would rise up, a longing for silence or the simple structure of a fugue. He’d look at a modern appliance and understand its function with 21st-century knowledge, while simultaneously seeing it as an abomination of meaningless plastic and arrogant design.

The arguments were constant, silent, and exhausting.

This clutter is intolerable, Thorne would think, looking at Leo’s shelves of books and knickknacks.

It’s a lived-in space, not a damned exhibit, Leo would fire back.

Your sustenance is an affront. Chemical and weak.

Your idea of food is gruel and rotten meat!

They fought over the temperature of the room, the quality of the light, the very pace of their breathing. It was a cold war fought in the trenches of their own body.

The only reprieve came in fleeting, unconscious moments. Leo, exhausted, would slip into a doze on the couch. And in that hypnagogic state, the barriers would sometimes soften. He’d dream not his dreams, or Thorne’s, but strange hybrids. He was in the textile mill, but the looms were made of glowing code. He was with Maya, but she wore a Victorian dress and spoke in riddles about cataloguing emotions. In these moments, there was no argument, only a bizarre, collaborative surrealism.

He awoke from one such dream, the taste of ozone and Earl Grey tea in his mouth. The room’s overlay was particularly strong. The gaslight glow was brighter, almost drowning out the electric light. The sound of the loom was a steady, comforting thrum. For a moment, he didn’t feel panic. He felt a strange, melancholic… familiarity.

You see, Thorne’s inner voice came, softer now. Not a threat, but a shared observation. It is not all horror. My world had its textures. Its certainties.

“Its miseries,” Leo countered, but without heat. He could feel those miseries too—the grinding poverty, the damp chill, the oppressive social rigidity—as if they were his own childhood memories.

As did yours, Thorne replied. The terrifying freedom. The existential noise. The loneliness of connection. He was rifling through Leo’s memories of scrolling through social media, feeling more isolated with each click.

It was the first moment of something resembling empathy. Not agreement. Not peace. But a mutual, horrified recognition of the other’s prison, past and present.

Leo got up and went to the window. The view was the most stable thing; the modern city street remained, though the glass itself seemed wavery, like old blown glass. He saw his faint reflection superimposed on the traffic below.

“What do we do?” he asked the window, the question meant for both of them.

We endure, Thorne thought. We negotiate. We find… protocols. For the sake of sanity. Your failsafe has doomed us to a shared existence. We must now write the rules for it.

It was a Victorian solution. A contract. A set of protocols for cohabitation. The absurdity of it almost made Leo laugh. A roommate agreement for a single soul.

“Okay,” Leo said aloud, his breath fogging the old/new glass. “Okay. We need… shifts. Times when you lead, and times when I lead. For simple things. To stop the fighting.”

A schedule, Thorne agreed, his mental presence shifting into something like his old, organizing mode. Divided consciousness. From dawn until noon, perhaps, the prevailing sensibilities of your era. From noon until evening, mine. A division of labor.

“And the memories? The… intrusions?”

We cannot wall them off. But we can label them. When you feel my memory of the workhouse, you will think ‘Archive.’ When I feel your memory of this ‘cinema,’ I will think ‘Record.’ A filing system. To maintain cognitive boundaries.

It was a desperate, fragile plan. A way to manage the unmanageable. To create the illusion of separate drawers in a single, broken cabinet.

Leo turned from the window. The room still shimmered with two realities, but the terror had receded, replaced by a grinding, eternal fatigue. This was his life now. Their life. A constant, conscious curation of the self.

He walked back to the center of the room, where the journal lay on the floor. The final page, where he’d written the trapped word, was no longer blank. It was filled now, not with his handwriting or Thorne’s, but with a new, hybrid script. It detailed the moment of fusion, the shattering, the overlay. It was the first entry of the new entity. The first document of the Archive.

He picked it up, the leather and paper feeling both alien and intimately familiar. He carried it to the mirror in the bathroom. He needed to see. He needed to know who would look back.

He raised his head.

His face. His own, tired, young man’s face. He made himself smile. The reflection smiled back, both sides of the mouth moving in unison this time. The eyes held a single, complex expression: grief, acceptance, horror, and a flicker of terrible curiosity.

Leo opened his mouth to speak, to test the protocol, to say “I.”

The reflection’s lips moved in perfect sync. And from their shared throat, in a voice that was neither his nor Thorne’s alone, but a resonant, blended instrument, came the words:

“We are we.”
