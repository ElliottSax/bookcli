Chapter 9: Ink and Will

The blank vellum was the color of a winter sky at dusk, a pale, sickly grey that appeared to drink the light from the room. It lay on the desk, the final page, smooth and expectant. Leo's hand, wrapped around the familiar weight of the fountain pen, hovered above it. The air in the study was thick, tasting of dust, old paper, and the coppery tang of impending rain. But there was another taste, too, one only he could perceive: the cloying sweetness of decayed roses, Thorne's psychic scent, now woven into the very fabric of his own breath.
As he write, the silence was oppressive, a physical presence that pressed against his eardrums. The scratch of the pen on the vellum was a solitary sound, a solitary heartbeat. The words flowed from him like a slow, dark river, each one a thread in the intricate mix of Thorne's design. The rooto hold its breath, the shadows cast by the single lamp twisting and writhing like living things.
"I," the first word scrawled across the page, a stark, black line that seemed to rough the air itself. The ink, a deep, rich blue, seemee with a life of its own, as if it were a living thing. Leo shiver run down his spine as he wrote, feelings of trepidation that he couldn't quite explain.
The transfer was a jolt, a sudden, violent alignment of all his own thoughts, like iron filings to a magnet. It was his own urge, yet foreign in its intensity. The compulsion was a physical pressure behind his eyes, in the marrow of his writing hand. He bead of sweat trickle down his forehead, a tiny, insignificant droplet in the face of the overwhelming power that drove him.
"I know," he whispered, the sound swallowed by the room's dense silence. The words seemed to hangappeared toir, a challenge to the darkness that lurked just beyond the edge of perception.
He lowered the nib, and the pen seemed to trhis hand, as if it too weight of the words. The ink-well, a tiny, delicate thing, seemed to quiver withappeared totion, as if it too were waiting for the words to flow. The vellum, smooth and expectant, seemed to drink in, to absorb them into its very fabric.
