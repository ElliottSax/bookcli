Chapter 7: Symbiosis

Chapter 7: Symbiosis

The silence in the flat was no longer empty. It was a held breath, a listening presence. Leo sat at the scarred kitchen table, a blank journal open before him, a pen laid precisely parallel to its spine. His right arm lay on the wood, palm down. It did not feel like his own. It felt like a rented instrument, a piece of machinery awaiting its operator’s command.

He watched, detached, as the tendons in his hand tightened. The fingers lifted, curled, and settled around the pen. The movement was fluid, utterly natural, and entirely without his volition. A marionette’s grace. The pen tip touched the paper.

Good morning, Leo. Shall we begin?

The handwriting was a work of art. Elegant, copperplate curls, the ink dark and confident. It was the hand of a man who wrote letters with a fountain pen, who kept ledgers, who believed in the permanence of his own thoughts. It was nothing like Leo’s own anxious scrawl.

Leo’s throat was dust. He tried to speak, but his vocal cords were just another set of unresponsive strings. He thought the words, screaming them inside the vault of his skull: Get out.

The hand wrote again, the pen whispering secrets to the page.

We are past such childishness. You invited me. The walls are thin. I am not a ghost in your machine, Leo. I am becoming the machine itself. Your resistance is a friction burn in a shared nervous system. It only hurts you.

A tremor, this time from Leo. A genuine, desperate spasm that made the pen skid, ruining the perfect ‘y’. The hand went still, as if in reproach. Then it calmly drew a line through the errant mark and continued.

You wish to survive. I understand this. It is a base instinct, but a potent one. I, too, wished to survive. My method was… more ambitious.

Leo’s eyes burned. He watched as his own hand, this elegant stranger, reached for the glass of water he’d poured an hour ago. It lifted the glass, took a sip. He felt the cool liquid in his mouth, sliding down his throat. The intimacy of it was a violation worse than any physical touch. He was a passenger in his own swallowing.

Let us negotiate, the hand wrote, setting the glass down without a sound. You have seen my memories. You know my failure. The ritual was incomplete. A soul is not a simple thing to transpose. It requires a vessel, not a vacancy. You are that vessel. But a vessel can be shaped.

“How?” The word scraped out of him, a dry leaf in a windless room.

The hand seemed to consider. It tapped the pen twice. Then it wrote: Help me complete the final sequence. The chemical preparation described in the diary. My notes are flawed, my hands at the end were… unreliable. Your mind, your modern understanding, can correct the formula. Do this, and I will show you how to remain.

“Remain?” Leo croaked. “As what? A voice in the back of my head?”

As a tenant, the hand wrote, the letters sharpening. This is not an eviction. It is a tenancy. The lease is permanent, but the structure can house more than one. You will have your hours. Your days. I require only certain… engagements. And the body’s maintenance, of course.

The offer hung in the air, more terrifying than any outright threat of obliteration. It spoke of a forever of sharing, of never being alone in the most profound sense. Of watching his own hands live another man’s life. It was a psychic parasite offering a symbiotic deal.

“And if I refuse?” Leo whispered.

His hand moved so fast it was a blur. It snatched the paring knife from the fruit bowl and, without a heartbeat of hesitation, drove the tip into the meat of his own forearm.

Leo screamed. The pain was white-hot and brilliant, entirely his. He felt the steel, the parting of skin, the shocking invasion. Blood welled, a perfect bead that traced a hot path toward his wrist. The hand held the knife there, buried a quarter-inch, a promise of deeper cuts.

I feel the pain as you do, the hand wrote, pulling the knife free. It laid the bloody utensil beside the journal. But my tolerance, forged in an age of purges and bloodletting, is considerably higher. I can make this flesh a prison of exquisite suffering. There will be no escape, even in madness. I will hold us both here, at the edge of feeling, for as long as it takes.

Tears of agony and helplessness blurred the elegant script. Leo cradled his wounded arm with his left hand, the red seeping between his fingers. The pain was an anchor, tying him to the horrific reality. Thorne wasn’t just in his mind; he was in his very nociceptors.

“Alright,” Leo gasped, the word a surrender. “Alright. The ritual.”

Wise, the hand wrote. It reached for the tea towel, folded it with fastidious care, and pressed it to the wound, applying pressure Leo hadn’t willed. Fetch the diary.

The next hours were a bizarre, claustrophobic collaboration. Leo’s mind, his knowledge of basic chemistry from a long-ago university course, was laid bare. Thorne rifled through it like a researcher in a library, pulling forth concepts and terms. Leo would feel a pressure behind his eyes, a sense of searching, and then his hand would fly across pages of scrap paper, sketching molecular structures of compounds Thorne had only known by alchemical symbols and folk names.

“Silver nitrate, not lunar caustic,” Leo heard himself say, but the voice was wrong. It was his vocal cords, but the cadence was archaic, the ‘r’s slightly rolled. “The purifying agent is oxidization, not divine essence. You were poisoning yourself.”

A crude understanding, his hand wrote in response, as if they were two separate entities. The spirit is refined through the ordeal of the flesh.

“The flesh dies from cyanide, you pretentious bastard,” Leo’s mouth spat, and he felt a curl on his lips that was not his smile. It was Thorne’s amusement at his own audacity.

He was fragmenting. He’d lose moments, and come back to find equations half-solved, or his legs carrying him to the bathroom cabinet to scrutinize the ingredients of antiseptics and cosmetics. Once, he surfaced to find himself standing before the grimy window, staring out at the rain-washed street. His reflection was pale, his eyes sunken. But the expression… it was a look of aristocratic disdain, a pinched, haughty evaluation of the world beyond the glass. “A cacophony of brick and noise,” his own mouth murmured with Thorne’s contempt. “No wonder the modern soul is so shallowly rooted.”

The horror of that moment wasn’t the loss of control. It was the blending. The thought felt like his own. The disdain for the bustling, ordinary world outside was a sentiment he’d nursed in his own depressive isolation. Thorne had simply tapped the well, given it a voice, and twisted it into something cruel and foreign yet eerily familiar.

They worked. Leo’s left hand, still somewhat his own, clumsily measured and ground powders purchased from dubious online apothecaries with Thorne’s antique money. His right hand, Thorne’s hand, performed the delicate work—the slow heating of a crucible over a camp stove, the careful addition of a tincture that smelled of bitter almonds and decay.

The mixture in the small ceramic bowl began to change. It was a sludge of grey and green at first, then, as Thorne guided his hand to stir it with a glass rod in a precise, counter-clockwise pattern, it shimmered. It deepened, not in color, but in substance. It became the black of a starless night, a black that seemed to drink the sickly yellow light of the kitchen bulb. Tiny motes of silver swirled within it, like galaxies coalescing in a miniature void.

It was beautiful. The thought came from a place deep within Leo, a scholar’s appreciation for a perfect result. But it was immediately stained by a surge of triumph, a greedy, ancient hunger that was all Thorne. The two emotions swirled together like the potion itself, inseparable.

It is ready, the hand wrote. The script was shaky now, charged with a palpable excitement. The final step. The conduit must be opened from within.

Leo stared at the black concoction. It was death in a bowl. He knew it. Every cell in his body, every instinct that was still purely Leo, recoiled.

“You said you’d tell me how to survive it,” Leo said, his voice small.

The hand picked up the pen. The writing was slower, as if sharing the secret required great effort.

The ritual does not transfer a consciousness. It merges them. Like two inks in water. The stronger will dictates the hue, but the volume is the sum of both. Your weakness is your selfhood, Leo. Your clinging to the idea of ‘Leo’ as a distinct thing. To survive, you must not resist the blend. You must… contribute. Pour yourself into the mixture. Your memories, your passions, your fears. Especially your fears. They are the anchor. He who fears loss has the most to hold onto. Do not fight to remain. Fight to be remembered.

It was a paradox. A psychic trap. To survive, he had to willingly dissolve. His only hope was to become an indelible stain on Thorne’s conquest.

“A tenancy,” Leo whispered, understanding the full, horrific meaning at last.

Indeed, the hand wrote. Now. Drink.

His right hand lifted the bowl. The smell was overpowering—ozone, old books, damp soil, and a coppery tang like blood. His left hand trembled violently at his side, a mute protest.

“Wait,” Leo begged.

There is no more time, Thorne’s voice spoke aloud, using Leo’s lips, the sound echoing in the small kitchen. The alignment is now. Drink, or I will make us drink.

Leo looked into the abyss in the bowl. He saw his own distorted reflection in its impossible surface. Then, with a shudder that was entirely his own, he gave a minute, almost imperceptible nod. Not consent, but capitulation.

His right hand brought the bowl to his lips. The ceramic was warm, almost feverish. He opened his mouth. The liquid touched his tongue.

It was cold and hot at once. It tasted of forgotten graves and lightning strikes. It flowed down his throat not like a liquid, but like a chain of ants, a swarm of static, a river of whispers. He tried to gag, but Thorne’s will held his throat open, forcing the entire draught down.

The world dissolved.

There was no kitchen. There was no body. There was a maelstrom of sensation and memory that was not his own. He was Erasmus Thorne, standing over a shrouded form on a stone slab, a scream of rage and failure tearing from his lungs. He was Leo, at seven years old, watching his mother’s car pull away for the last time, a hollow opening up in his chest. He was Thorne dissecting a frog, marveling at the machinery of life. He was Leo dissecting his own past in therapy, word by useless word. He was the damp chill of the 19th-century basement, the sterile chill of a modern pharmacy, the heat of ambition, the cold sweat of fear.

The memories collided, spliced, overwrote one another. He felt Thorne’s contempt for the weak, and recognized its seed in his own social anxieties. He felt Leo’s longing for connection warp into Thorne’s manipulative charm. It was a psychic surgery without anesthetic, two histories being sutured into a single, ragged scar.

He felt a presence, vast and dark and old, pressing against the core of him. It was Thorne, the true Thorne, not the memory-fragments, but the central, ravenous will. It sought to envelop him, to make his consciousness a mere footnote in its own revived narrative.

Fight to be remembered.

Leo didn’t push back. He poured forward. He didn’t shout “I am Leo!” He offered: The smell of burnt toast on a Tuesday morning. The crushing weight of a deadline you know you’ll miss. The specific ache of loving someone who is just out of reach. The comfort of a repetitive, meaningless task. The taste of your own blood from a bitten cheek. The sound of your own heartbeat in a silent room.

He offered his mundane, pathetic, exquisite human experience. Not as a shield, but as a dye.

The dark presence recoiled, not in pain, but in confusion. This was not the resistance of a soul—it was the adhesion of texture. Leo’s life was not a sword to parry with; it was a glue, a resin, a stain seeping into the fine leather of Thorne’s being.

The maelstrom began to still. Sensations returned, but altered. The cold linoleum under his feet. The taste of the ritual potion, now a fading echo on a shared tongue. The sound of his own breathing, ragged and dual-toned, as if two people were trying to use the same lungs.

Leo opened his eyes. He was on the kitchen floor, curled on his side. He sat up. The movement was coordinated, singular. He looked at his hands—both of them. They were his. They were theirs.

He stood. The body felt… efficient. The chronic ache in his lower back from too much sitting was gone, edited out by Thorne’s disregard for such modern weaknesses. The constant buzz of low-grade anxiety in his chest was still there, but it was now compartmentalized, placed in a mental drawer labeled ‘Leo’s Concerns.’

He walked to the window. The world outside was the same. And yet, it was perceived through a dual lens. He saw the ugly satellite dish on the building opposite and thought a scar on the skyline. A moment later, the thought was followed by, but it brings information from orbits unseen. The first thought was Thorne’s. The second, his own. They existed in tandem, a call and response within one skull.

He spoke, testing his voice. The sound that came out was a harmony, a single voice produced by two wills.

“The walls,” they said, Leo and Thorne in unsettling unison, the words resonating in the quiet flat, “must thin.”

It was not a statement of intent. It was a declaration of fact. The first ritual had thinned the walls between them. The next, they both understood with a cold, shared certainty, would thin the walls between this room and everything else. Between the tenant and the world.

Leo felt a smile form on his face. It was a smile of grim satisfaction, of ancient hunger nearing its satisfaction. He felt it, shared it, and in a tiny, locked room at the back of their merged mind, a part of him that was still just Leo wept in perfect, silent terror.
