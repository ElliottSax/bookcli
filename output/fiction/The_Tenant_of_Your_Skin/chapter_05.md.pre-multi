Chapter 5: The Landlord

Chapter 5: The Landlord

The rebellion began, as most doomed things do, with a simple plan. Leo would burn a single page.

It wasn’t even a significant page. It was from the later section of Thorne’s diary, a tedious account of a dispute with a greengrocer over the quality of turnips. The handwriting was dense, the ink a rust-brown that looked too much like dried blood. Leo’s logic was surgical: he would prove the fragments were just paper and ink, not vessels. He would prove he could destroy a piece of Thorne without destroying himself. He selected the page with trembling fingers, the paper feeling oddly pliant, like skin left too long in bathwater.

He stood in the center of the living room, the page held over a ceramic bowl he’d taken from the kitchen. The lighter was in his other hand, a cheap plastic thing. The air in the flat was still and watchful. The usual soundtrack—the drip from the kitchen tap, the muffled thump of a neighbor’s bass—had faded into a thick silence. He could hear the wet click of his own swallow.

Just a page. It’s nothing.

He flicked the lighter. The flame sprang up, a jaunty, ordinary yellow. He brought it to the corner of the paper.

A coldness, sharp as a dental probe, jabbed into the base of his skull. It wasn’t pain, not exactly. It was the absence of something, a sudden, yawning vacuum where the solidity of his own thoughts should be. The flame kissed the paper. A brown curl, a wisp of smoke.

And then the fear hit.

It did not come from him. It flooded in, bypassing his mind, seizing his nervous system directly. It was a pure, animal terror of dissolution, a certainty that the universe itself was unraveling from the edges inward, and he was at the epicenter of that un-becoming. It was the horror of the void, not as a concept, but as a physical destination. His lungs locked. The lighter fell from nerveless fingers, extinguishing on the carpet. The page fluttered after it, its charred corner a tiny, black eye.

Leo was on his knees, then curled on his side, fetal. He could not draw breath. His heart was a frantic bird battering its ribs. The room did not spin; it pulled away, elongating, the walls stretching into a dark tunnel at the end of which was absolute nothingness. He was going to cease. Not die. Cease. Be unmade. Be forgotten.

No no no not nothing never nothing must remain must persist I MUST—

The voice was a gale in his head, but the terror was in his cells. He clawed at the carpet, trying to anchor himself to reality, but the fibers felt insubstantial as ash. This was Thorne’s fear. Not of death, but of oblivion. The core terror of a man who built his immortality from other men’s clay. And it was now Leo’s autonomic response.

The attack subsided by inches, leaving him shivering in a pool of cold sweat. It took twenty minutes for his vision to clear, for the sensation of infinite cold to retreat from his fingertips. He lay there, smelling his own sour breath and the faint, acrid scent of the singed paper. The bowl sat nearby, empty and absurd.

The rebellion was over. He had not been fighting an invader; he had been fighting a law of physics. Thorne was not a guest. He was the landlord. And Leo had just tried to burn a piece of the property.

The agoraphobia, which had been a manageable tightness in his chest, a persuasive voice suggesting he order in, became a physical barricade. The thought of the hallway outside his flat door now induced a milder version of the void-terror. The world beyond was not threatening in itself; it was a canvas of unbearable exposure. Out there, he was Leo, fragile and known. In here, he was… becoming. The diary was the crucible.

He stopped going out entirely. Groceries were delivered, left at the door after a pre-paid, contactless transaction. He would wait until he heard the retreating footsteps of the courier, count to one hundred, then open the door a crack and snatch the bags inside, his heart hammering at the glimpse of the empty, echoing stairwell.

His work suffered, then ceased. His editor’s emails went from concerned to annoyed to silent. The world of deadlines and word counts belonged to a different species. His only meaningful work was the reading. The diary was no longer a book; it was a room he lived inside.

And Thorne’s memories began to project themselves.

At first, it was just a persistence of sensation after reading—the smell of coal smoke clinging to the air for an hour, the phantom weight of a wool greatcoat on his shoulders. Then it became independent. He would be making tea, and the kitchen wall would shimmer. For a three-second pulse, the white plaster would be overlaid with dingy Victorian wallpaper, flocked with dark velveteen patterns, stained with damp. The electric hum of the fridge would be drowned by the pop and crackle of a grate fire. He’d blink, and it would be gone, leaving only a ghost of sulfur in the air.

Soon, it was longer. He woke from a doze in his armchair to find the entire flat transformed. His sleek sofa was a hard, horsehair chaise longue. The streetlight outside his window was the guttering orange glow of a gas lamp. The air was thick with tobacco smoke and the sweet, rotten scent of decaying flowers. He saw a woman in a high-necked dress, her back to him, looking out the window. She turned—her face was a smudge of pale paint, featureless—and the vision dissolved like sugar in water, leaving him gasping, the taste of laudanum on his tongue.

The memories weren’t playing in his head. They were playing on the world. Thorne was wallpapering over Leo’s reality with his own.

The physical changes were slower, more insidious. He noticed the handwriting first. He’d tried to leave a note for himself on the fridge: CALL EDITOR. The letters came out in a cramped, angular script, all sharp angles and aggressive downstrokes. It looked nothing like his own loose, rounded hand. He tried again, consciously forcing his fingers to form the familiar shapes. The result was a grotesque hybrid, a child’s mimicry. His hand ached, a deep muscular protest, as if the very tendons had been restrung. He gave up. The note stayed, a stark declaration of occupation in Thorne’s own hand.

The cravings were worse. He had never smoked. The smell of cigarettes was, to him, the smell of bus stations and anxiety. But one afternoon, a hunger woke in him—not for food, but for a specific, dusty, aromatic bitterness. It coated his imagination. He could almost taste it: a dark, smoky flavor, with a hint of something like dried fruit and spice. Perique, the word floated up from nowhere. He wanted it with a desperation that felt hormonal. He found himself online, ordering a pipe and a small bag of blending tobacco described as “19th-century style.” When the package arrived, his hands shook as he packed the pipe. Lighting it was awkward, unfamiliar. But the first puff, though it made him cough violently, also brought a wave of profound, cellular satisfaction. He sat in Thorne’s armchair (it was Thorne’s now), sucking on the pipe, and the flat seemed to settle around him, approving, complete. The smoke curled in the air, filling the spaces Thorne’s memories had not yet claimed.
Leo’s existence narrowed to a single point: the diary, the pipe, the shifting room. He bathed rarely. He ate without tasting. Time was no longer linear; it was a pool he waded through, sometimes stepping into a cold pocket of 1887, sometimes surfacing into the blurred present. He spoke aloud, rehearsing arguments with Thorne, but his voice began to sound strange in his own ears—his cadences more formal, his vowels tightening.

The hook came on a Tuesday, or perhaps a Thursday. The light was the same.

A sharp, authoritative knock rattled the door. Not the timid tap of a delivery driver, but a firm rat-a-tat-tat. It bypassed his conscious mind and connected directly to a conditioned reflex: someone is at the door; you answer.

He was moving before he could think, propelled by a ghost of etiquette. He didn’t check the peephole. He simply opened the door, the stink of his unwashed self and the pipe tobacco wafting out into the hall.

A young woman stood there, holding a tablet, dressed in the bright nylon jacket of a premium courier service. She had a kind, bored face.

“Leo Gable? Sign for this, please.” She proffered the tablet and a stylus.

Leo looked at her. He saw not just her, but a superimposition. The nylon jacket flickered, became the thick wool of a telegraph boy’s uniform. The tablet was a leather-bound receipt book. The fluorescent hall light was a dim, dusty sconce. The words that came out of his mouth were not his own. They were formed in a voice deeper, rougher, edged with an accent that was not quite London, not quite anything from this century.

“State your business, girl, and be quick about it. I’ve no patience for gawpers.”

The courier’s eyes widened. Her professional smile froze, then melted into confusion and a dawning alarm. She took a half-step back. “I… sorry? Just need a signature, mate.”

The word “mate” jolted something. The vision of the telegraph boy snapped. Leo saw her clearly now—her modern haircut, her eyebrow piercing, the logo on her jacket. He saw himself reflected in her wide eyes: a gaunt, wild-haired man in a stained dressing gown, reeking of strange tobacco, his eyes sunken and ancient.

A horror, entirely his own, rose in his throat. He had spoken, but he had not been the speaker.

He tried to force his own voice, his own words. What came out was a strained, wet croak. He snatched the stylus, scrawled something approximating his name—it looked like Thorne’s handwriting—on the tablet screen and thrust it back at her. He grabbed the small package from her other hand.

“My… apologies,” he managed, the words fighting their way through a foreign syntax. “I am… unwell.”

He slammed the door. He heard her rapid footsteps retreating down the stairs. He slid down the back of the door until he sat on the floor, the package clutched to his chest. He was trembling violently. The aftertaste of the old idiom was in his mouth, metallic and foul. He had not chosen those words. They had been the Landlord’s response, issued through his vocal cords.

He was not losing his mind. He was being evicted from it.

For a long time, he sat in the silence. The flat felt different. The superimpositions were gone. It was just his shabby, modern flat. But the silence was new. It was a listening silence. A waiting silence.

From the bedroom, a soft, rhythmic sound began.

Scratch… scratch… scratch.

It was the sound of a pen on paper. Deliberate. Unhurried.

Leo’s blood turned to ice. He had not left a pen out. He never wrote anymore.

The sound continued, a steady, metronomic inscription.

Slowly, mechanically, Leo pushed himself to his feet. His legs were numb. He walked towards the bedroom door, which was ajar. The scratch-scratch-scratch* was the only sound in the world.

He pushed the door open.

The room was empty. The bed was unmade. The diary lay closed on the bedside table.

But on the wall above the bed, written in the same rust-brown ink that filled the diary, in the handwriting that was now his own, was a fresh line of text. It was not on paper. It was inscribed directly onto the cream-colored paint, as if the plaster itself had accepted the ink.

The message was simple, a notification from the new management:

“The lease is perpetual.”
