Chapter 6: A Trellis of Lies

The morning after the police tore apart her greenhouse, Rosehaven seemed to hold its breath. A gossamer mist clung to the cobblestones of Petal Lane, softening the edges of the world, but it couldn’t mute the vibrant, accusing yellow of police tape still fluttering from Elara’s gate. She stood across the street, sipping a fortifying mug of strong tea, and watched Nutmeg systematically deconstruct a fallen magnolia blossom. The destruction of her sanctuary had left a hollow, angry feeling in her chest, but it had also lit a cold, clear flame of determination. They had planted evidence in her garden. Someone had walked into her home, her heart-space, and violated it. That made it personal in a way even murder hadn’t.

Her first lead was the phantom visitor Marigold Lee had mentioned—the man who’d come asking about the ‘Midnight Blush’ rose not long before her death. It was a thin thread, but the only one she had. A few discreet inquiries at the other nurseries, phrased as professional curiosity about a potential customer, led her by lunchtime to a place called ‘The Verdant Veil.’

It was a garden supply shop tucked down a narrow alley off the main square, all dark green paint and mullioned windows displaying artfully arranged trowels and copper watering cans. A bell tinkled with a sound like falling icicles as she entered. The air was rich with the smells of peat moss, leather gloves, and the faint, peppery scent of new seeds.

The clerk emerged, wiping his hands on a canvas apron. He was a man in his late twenties, with sandy hair swept back from a high forehead and eyes the pale green of shallow seawater. He had the careful, slightly rigid posture of someone used to being overlooked. “Leo Vance,” he said, offering a brief, dry smile. “How can I help you?”

Vance. The name struck a chord, a low, discordant note in the symphony of Rosehaven’s history. The third founding family, the ones supposedly cheated out of the legendary hybrid formula. Elara kept her expression one of polite interest.

“I’m Elara Bloom. I own the new greenhouse on Petal Lane.”

His smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Ah. Yes. I’ve heard. You’ve had some… excitement.”

“You could say that.” She leaned casually against a display of organic fertilizers. “I’m actually trying to track down a fellow enthusiast. I heard someone was asking about a ‘Midnight Blush’ rose recently. A rare cultivar. I’m trying to source one myself.”

A subtle tension stiffened Leo’s shoulders. He turned to adjust a row of seed packets, aligning them perfectly. “I get a lot of inquiries.”

“This would have been a few weeks ago. A man, asking old Marigold Lee ov
