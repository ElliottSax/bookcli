Chapter 3: A Thorny Inheritance

Chapter 3: A Thorny Inheritance

The scent of damp earth and blooming jasmine did little to soothe Elara Finch’s nerves. Two days after Councilman Thornbury’s dramatic demise, the town of Rosehaven still hummed with a brittle, gossip-fueled energy. The police had been methodical, questioning, and utterly opaque. Chief Henderson, a man whose mustache seemed perpetually annoyed, had given nothing away when he’d visited Elara’s cottage. His questions had been polite, sharp, and entirely focused on her proximity to the prize-winning ‘Midnight Siren’ rose at the moment of Thornbury’s collapse.

“It’s not suspicion, Ms. Finch,” he’d said, his voice like gravel rolling in a tin. “It’s procedure. You were there. You saw it. Now, about your dog…”

Nutmeg, currently snuffling along the pristine gravel path of ‘Marigold’s Marvels,’ had taken grave offence to the implication that a corgi could be an accessory to murder. He’d spent the evening after Henderson’s visit grumbling into his favourite chew-toy with a vigour usually reserved for postmen.

Elara had decided that the best antidote to being a passive ‘person of interest’ was active curiosity. And her curiosity had led her to Marigold Lee. The owner of Rosehaven’s most beloved nursery had been Thornbury’s secret business partner in the contentious land deal—a tidbit unearthed by Nutmeg’s unparalleled eavesdropping skills at the post office. If anyone knew the thornier details of the councilman’s life, it would be Marigold.

The nursery was a symphony of green and colour. Terra cotta pots held court with verdant ferns, rows of perennials stood at cheerful attention, and climbing roses cascaded over wooden arches. It was a place of life. Yet, as Elara pushed open the wrought-iron gate, a peculiar silence hung in the air. The usual classical music that wafted from Marigold’s open workshop door was absent.

“Hello?” Elara called, her voice swallowed by the foliage. “Marigold?”

Nutmeg’s ears pricked forward, and he let out a soft, uncertain woof. He trotted ahead, his nose working overtime, heading not for the main shop but around the side towards a glass-paned greenhouse. The door was ajar.

Inside, the humidity was a warm, clinging blanket. The air was thick with the perfume of gardenias and the sharper, earthier smell of fertilizer. And there, amidst a riot of exotic orchids, lay Marigold Lee.

She was sprawled on the mossy brick floor, one hand flung out as if reaching for a watering can that had rolled away. Her face, usually tanned and crinkled with good-humoured smiles, was a waxy, pallid mask. At the centre of the scene, absurdly bright and cheerful on a workbench, sat a bouquet. It was a fierce, dramatic thing of deep crimson roses, spiky thistles, and black-edged lilies, all bound with a vicious-looking twist of barbed wire. It was less a bouquet and more a declaration of war.

Elara’s hand flew to her mouth. Nutmeg whined, pressing his warm body against her leg. She forced herself forward, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. Marigold’s other hand was clutched to her chest, a single bead of dried blood on her thumb where a rose thorn had bitten deep.

“Oh, Marigold,” Elara whispered, the words catching. This wasn’t the dramatic public spectacle of Thornbury’s death. This was intimate, quiet, and infinitely more terrible.

She didn’t need to wait for the coroner. The unnatural stillness, the faint, acrid scent beneath the florals—something like bitter almonds but greener, more vegetal—told her this was no accident. Her eyes darted to the bouquet. The thorns on the roses looked… wrong. Glossy, almost artificially thickened at their bases.

The wail of sirens, when they came, felt inevitable. Chief Henderson’s arrival was less so. He filled the doorway of the greenhouse, his expression shifting from professional concern to a stormy disbelief as his eyes took in Elara, the body, and the dog.

“Ms. Finch,” he said, the words heavy with exhaustion. “We have to stop meeting like this.”

“I just found her,” Elara said, her voice surprisingly steady. “Nutmeg led me here. The door was open.”

Henderson knelt by Marigold, his movements careful. He didn’t touch the bouquet, but his gaze lingered on it. “Nasty piece of work. Sent or received?”

“I don’t know. There might be a card.”

A young officer, gloved, gently extracted a small envelope from the barbed-wire binding. He read it, his eyes widening. He handed it to Henderson.

The Chief’s head swivelled slowly towards Elara. “It says, ‘With condolences on your loss. A thorn for a thorn. – Elara Finch.’”

The world tilted. “That’s impossible. I didn’t send that. I didn’t even know she was… connected to Thornbury until yesterday!”

“The handwriting,” Henderson mused, holding the card up. It was a flowing, elegant script. “Is this yours?”

“No. Mine looks like a drunk spider fell in an inkwell. Chief, you can’t seriously think—”

“I think,” he interrupted, his tone final, “that you are now present at the scene of a second poisoning, with your name literally attached to the murder weapon. I think you will come to the station. Now. And the dog… can go with Officer Briggs.”

The interview room was cold and smelled of stale coffee and regret. Henderson was thorough, circling the same questions like a gardener weeding a stubborn patch. Where was she this morning? Did she bear any grudge against Marigold Lee? Why was she at the nursery?

Elara answered with strained patience. She’d been at home, sketching new designs for a client’s patio garden. She’d liked Marigold, bought all her heirloom tomato plants from her. She’d gone to the nursery to ask about Thornbury, to understand the land deal.

“So you were investigating,” Henderson stated, leaning back. “Amateur detective work. In my experience, Ms. Finch, that’s usually undertaken by people who have something to hide, or a morbid desire to insert themselves into a story.”

“In my experience, Chief,” Elara shot back, her charm wearing thin, “when the police are busy looking at the obvious, sometimes the obscure needs a little sunlight. Someone is planting evidence. Literally. First a rose, now a bouquet.”

He released her three hours later, with a stern warning not to leave town and to stop ‘poking the bear.’ “The next thorn you find,” he said, holding the door open for her, “might be in your own side.”

Nutmeg, who had been lavishly spoiled with biscuits by the desk sergeant, greeted her with enthusiastic licks and a look that clearly said, ‘I told you so.’

Back in her cottage, with the kettle whistling a comforting tune, Elara’s mind refused to settle. The bouquet was the key. It was theatrical, personal. The toxin, Henderson had grudgingly revealed during a moment of pressured conversation, was oleander extract. Highly concentrated. Injected into the thorns. A prick was all it took. A slow, paralytic end delivered by something beautiful.

“It’s a message, Nutmeg,” she said, stirring honey into her tea. “A thorn for a thorn. Someone is settling scores. And they’re using me as their delivery service.”

The land deal. It had to be the connective tissue. Thornbury and Marigold were secret partners. Who lost out? Who wanted them both gone? The answer, she was sure, lay in Marigold’s records.

Which is how, at ten o’clock that night, Elara found herself and a decidedly un-enthused corgi skulking around the back of Marigold’s Marvels. The police tape fluttered in the breeze, but the place was dark and deserted.

“This is a terrible idea,” she muttered to Nutmeg, who responded by sneezing at a patch of lavender. “But we’re already on Henderson’s list. Might as well earn our spot.”

She used a credit card to jimmy the latch on the back office window—a trick she’d learned from a particularly dramatic mystery novel. The room was a chaotic homage to horticulture. Seed catalogues teetered in piles, invoices speared on spikes, and the scent of peat moss and old paper was overwhelming.

Nutmeg immediately began investigating a half-empty bag of organic chicken-fertilizer pellets with keen interest.

“Focus, partner,” Elara whispered, clicking on her small torch.

She started with the filing cabinet. Invoices, supplier contracts, payroll for two part-time teenagers. Nothing. Then she turned to the large, leather-bound ledger on the desk. Marigold kept her books by hand. The entries were meticulous: sales of bedding plants, profits from the annual rose sale, costs for potting mix. Then, near the back, she found it.

A separate, folded sheet of paper, tucked like a secret. It was a simple profit-loss projection, but the figures made Elara’s eyes widen. It referenced “Project Gilded Vale” and projected returns in the high six figures. The partners listed were M. Lee and C. Thornbury. But there was a third, abbreviated entry: a series of monthly, sizable outgoing payments to an entity simply labelled “SV.” The last payment was dated just last week. And in the margin, in Marigold’s looping script, was a note: “SV getting greedy. C. says handle it. But how?”

“Someone was blackmailing them,” Elara breathed. “Or it was a payoff. SV.”

Nutmeg, having deemed the fertilizer pellets unworthy, nudged her ankle. His head was cocked, ears like satellite dishes. A second later, Elara heard it too: the soft crunch of gravel on the path outside.

The office door flew open.

A man stood silhouetted against the moonlight, his frame tense. He was in his late twenties, with the lean build of someone who worked outdoors, and hair the same sun-bleached straw colour as Marigold’s. His eyes, wide with shock and anger, darted from Elara to the open ledger.

“You!” he spat. It was Liam, Marigold’s nephew. He worked at the nursery sometimes, mostly with the heavy lifting. “What are you doing? This is a crime scene! My aunt is dead!”

“Liam, I’m so sorry,” Elara said, her mind racing. “I was… I was trying to understand.”

“Understand what? How to rob her blind while she’s cold?” He took a step forward, his hands clenched. “I knew you were trouble. The police said your name was on that poison bouquet. Get away from her books!”

“I didn’t send it. Someone is framing me. I think someone was threatening your aunt and Thornbury. Look.” She pointed a trembling finger at the ledger entry. “SV. Do you know what that means? Who SV is?”

Liam’s anger faltered, replaced by a flicker of confusion. He glanced at the page. “SV? No. I don’t know. She never said.” His voice cracked. “She just said she and the Councilman had a big project coming up. That it would set us up for life. She was… she was scared lately. Jumpy. I thought it was the stress.”

“This ‘Project Gilded Vale,’” Elara pressed gently. “Did she ever mention where it was?”

“Some old farmland on the west edge of town,” Liam mumbled, his defiance crumbling into grief. “Near the river. It’s been fallow for years. She said it was going to be beautiful.” He looked at Elara, his eyes glistening. “You should go. Now. Before I call Chief Henderson and tell him I caught the murderer red-handed.”

“I’m not the murderer, Liam.”

“Prove it somewhere else.”

Defeated, Elara gently closed the ledger. Nutmeg gave a low growl, not at Liam, but at the oppressive darkness of the room. They left the way they came, Liam’s hostile gaze burning into their backs until they turned the corner.

The walk home was long and fraught with paranoia. Every rustle in the hedgerow seemed menacing; every shadow held a watching shape. The warm, familiar glow of her cottage windows was the most beautiful sight she’d ever seen.

She hurried up the garden path, fumbling for her keys, desperate for the solid click of the lock and the comfort of her own four walls.

She never reached the lock.

There, placed precisely in the centre of her weathered doormat—the one that cheerfully read ‘GO AWAY’—was a single, lance-shaped leaf. It was a deep, glossy green, veined with a subtle, poisonous yellow.

Elara froze, her blood turning to ice water. She didn’t need her botanical encyclopaedia. She knew this leaf. She’d just spent the afternoon hearing its toxic properties detailed by a police chief.

Oleander.

It wasn’t a bouquet. It wasn’t a card. It was a simple, elegant, and utterly terrifying statement. A single leaf. A warning that needed no words.

They knew where she lived. They knew she was digging. And they were telling her, quite clearly, that the next prick of a thorn could very well be hers.

With a trembling hand, Elara scooped up Nutmeg, holding his warm, wriggling body close. She unlocked the door, stepped inside, and slammed it shut, locking the world—and the silent, deadly message on her doorstep—outside. In the sudden, profound quiet of her hall, with only the sound of Nutmeg’s anxious panting, one thought echoed, cold and clear.

The killer wasn’t finished. And now, Elara Finch was no longer just an investigator.

She was the next target on the list.
