Chapter 11: The Last Petal Falls

Chapter 11: The Last Petal Falls

The air in Beatrice Winstone’s pristine conservatory was thick with the cloying perfume of night-blooming jasmine and the sharp, metallic tang of fear. Elara Bloom, her back pressed against a cold terracotta pot containing a particularly vicious-looking specimen of Dieffenbachia, felt the weight of the syringe in Beatrice’s steady hand as if it were already pricking her skin. Nutmeg, a quivering ball of orange and white fur, was tucked behind Elara’s ankles, a low, continuous growl rumbling in his tiny chest.

“It really is a shame, Elara,” Beatrice sighed, the picture of genteel regret. She adjusted her grip on the syringe, a delicate instrument that looked better suited for inoculating orchids than delivering a fatal dose of tetrodotoxin. “You have a genuine gift for nuisance. I had hoped you’d see reason, take the blame with some dignity. A tragic, guilt-ridden suicide after your ‘breakdown.’ The village would have mourned you, eventually.”

Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird in a cage. Her eyes darted from Beatrice’s calm face to the glass walls of the conservatory, reflecting the deepening indigo of the twilight sky. The police were out there, supposedly. Constable Miller, alerted by a frantic, coded text from Elara an hour ago, should have been lurking in the rhododendrons. But the only movement was the slow, sinister unfurling of a Darlingtonia pitcher plant in the corner.

“Dignity seems in short supply when you’re being framed for multiple murders, Beatrice,” Elara said, forcing her voice into a conversational tone that felt utterly alien. “And I’m afraid my knowledge of local fungi extends beyond the culinary. Suicide by rare Japanese pufferfish toxin would raise even old Dr. Henderson’s eyebrows from his grave.”

A flicker of irritation crossed Beatrice’s perfectly composed features. “A minor detail. The ‘why’ is always more compelling than the ‘how’ for people like them. A broken woman, her business failing, lashing out at those who slighted her… then consumed by remorse.” She took a small step forward, her sensible brogues silent on the flagstone floor. “Now, hold still. This will be quicker if you don’t struggle. And for heaven’s sake, control your rodent.”

Nutmeg’s growl intensified. Elara felt a surge of protective fury that burned away some of the fear. She had to keep Beatrice talking. The recorder in her cardigan pocket was a silent witness, but it wouldn’t be much help if she were dead.

“Before you do something we’ll both regret—well, that you’ll regret—I have to say,” Elara began, her gaze drifting past Beatrice to the stands of lush, deadly greenery. “I’ve always admired your Aconitum. The monkshood. It’s a magnificent specimen. The ‘Queen of Poisons,’ they call it. So… biblical. A crown of vengeance.”

Beatrice paused, her head tilting slightly. Praise of her horticultural prowess was a key that turned a lock in her. “Aconitum napellus,” she corrected, a teacher’s pride softening her voice. “Not merely ‘monkshood.’ Every part of it exquisite, and every part fatal. It was the first in my collection.”

“It was your choice for Gerald, wasn’t it?” Elara pressed, her mind racing. “In his terrible sherry. Not just for its potency, but for the symbolism. He uprooted your family’s legacy with his cheap development plans. You gave him a taste of the earth he sought to pave over. Poetic, in a vicious sort of way.”

“You do understand,” Beatrice murmured, almost pleased. “It’s not mere killing, Elara. It’s curation. Pruning the rotten branches to protect the health of the whole. Gerald, that noisy, vulgar YouTube man, Marjorie with her toxic gossip… they were blights. I am a gardener.”

“The best in the county,” Elara agreed, nodding slowly. She inched her right foot sideways, creating a slightly wider barrier for Nutmeg. “Your illustrations proved that. The detail! The Daphne for Marjorie, its pretty berries hiding its corrosive sap. The Foxglove for the internet fellow, all showy trumpet and deadly digitalis. You didn’t just kill them; you annotated them. It’s a level of artistry I can only aspire to.”

Beatrice’s lips twitched in a semblance of a smile. The syringe lowered a fraction of an inch.

“But even artists make mistakes,” Elara said, her tone shifting subtly from admiration to collegial critique.

The smile vanished. “I don’t make mistakes.”

“Oh, but a tiny one,” Elara said, her eyes now fixed on Beatrice’s with feigned sympathy. “With Gerald. The monkshood. You grew it here, in this private conservatory, harvested the roots, mashed them, strained the liquor into his bottle. A flawless process. But you see, Constable Miller—bless his plodding heart—sent the murder weapon, the sherry bottle, to a specialist lab in London. At my suggestion.”

Beatrice’s knuckles whitened around the syringe. “There was nothing to find. I wore gloves. I cleaned everything.”

“Not everything,” Elara whispered, the suspense coiling in the fragrant air. “Pollen, Beatrice. A specific, rare pollen from a subspecies of Aconitum that only flowers under very specific conditions of humidity and shade. Conditions, according to the county horticultural society database, that you alone have perfected in your award-winning ‘Hades’ Bower’ micro-climate project. That pollen was on the lip of the bottle. Invisible to the naked eye, but as damning as a fingerprint to a palynologist. It places that bottle, irrevocably, here. In this room.”

It was a gamble. A huge one. The pollen analysis was real—Elara had read the report that morning after badgering Miller for weeks—but the link to Beatrice’s private sub-species was an inspired bluff, woven from snippets of gossip from the garden club and Beatrice’s own boastful article in The Botanist’s Quarterly.

For a long moment, Beatrice simply stared. Then a flush crept up her neck, mottling her porcelain skin. “That’s impossible,” she hissed. “The Aconitum variegatum in the north bed is a different cultivar entirely! Its pollen is larger, stickier! It couldn’t have traveled! You’re lying.”

Elara saw the crack in her armor and drove the wedge in deeper. “Variegatum? No, no, I’m talking about the A. napellus ‘Midnight Sable’ you’re so proud of. The one you hybridized yourself. Its pollen is distinctively trilobed under the microscope. The report was quite clear.”

“Ridiculous!” Beatrice snapped, her composure shattering. The syringe was now gesturing erratically as she argued. “ ‘Midnight Sable’ wasn’t even in bloom when Gerald died! Its flowering cycle is late August! You ignorant girl, you don’t know what you’re talking about! The pollen would have been from the common Aconitum in the east bed, which is genetically identical to fifty others in the county!”

The diversion was working. Her focus had shifted from murder to microbiology. Elara’s muscles tensed. She gave a subtle, gentle nudge with her heel against Nutmeg’s side—their signal.

“The east bed?” Elara feigned confusion, taking a small step sideways, drawing Beatrice’s furious gaze. “But the soil pH there is all wrong for potent alkaloid development. Surely you wouldn’t use an inferior plant for such an important… application.”

“You dare lecture me on soil chemistry?” Beatrice spat, taking an incensed step forward, her ankle now perilously close to a small, terracotta pot of creeping thyme. “My soil is perfectly balanced! The potency was optimal! The proof is in the fact he was dead in three hours!”

It was then that Nutmeg moved. He didn’t bark. He was a silent, furry bolt of lightning. As Beatrice leaned forward, jabbing the air with the syringe to emphasize her point, he darted out, not for the hand with the weapon, but for the exposed ankle above her brogue. It wasn’t a savage bite, but a precise, herding nip—the kind he used to redirect sheepish tourists from Elara’s prized delphiniums.

“Yowch!” Beatrice yelped, more in surprise than pain, stumbling backward. Her heel caught the edge of the thyme pot. For a second, she windmilled her arms, the syringe glinting in the last of the sunset’s red light. The moment stretched, thin and elastic.

Elara launched herself. It wasn’t a graceful tackle, but a desperate, sprawling grab. Her hands closed around Beatrice’s wrist just as the older woman regained her balance. They crashed into a tray of seedling Atropa belladonna, sending tiny pots of future nightmare crashing to the floor. The world became a whirl of soil, shattered clay, and the pungent smell of disturbed earth and greenery.

Beatrice was strong, fueled by a lifetime of hauling compost and a core of pure, cold fury. She fought like a wild thing, silent and efficient, trying to bring the syringe down towards Elara’s neck. Elara, grunting, used her leverage, twisting the wrist with all her strength against the joint. She heard, rather than felt, a small, sickening pop.

Beatrice gasped. The syringe slipped from her fingers.

It clattered onto the flagstones, rolling away towards a dense clump of ferns. Both women scrambled for it, but Elara was closer, her fingers closing over the cool glass barrel just as the conservatory door burst open.

“Police! Nobody move!”

Constable Miller stood framed in the doorway, looking profoundly out of his depth and remarkably brave for it. Two younger, broader officers surged past him, seizing Beatrice, who went limp in their grasp, all the fight draining out of her as suddenly as it had come.

The silence that followed was broken only by heavy breathing and the drip of water from a disturbed irrigation hose. Elara sat back on her heels, the deadly syringe held carefully away from her body, her cardigan torn, her hair full of soil and Belladonna leaves. Nutmeg trotted over and licked her grimy cheek, his whole body wagging.

Beatrice allowed herself to be handcuffed, her eyes never leaving Elara’s face. As the officers led her past, she paused. The charming, witty hostess of the garden club was gone. In her place was something ancient and stark, a woman who saw the world as a plot of land to be ruthlessly weeded.

“You think you’ve saved the garden, Elara,” she said, her voice calm, almost conversational. “But you haven’t. You’ve just postponed the inevitable pruning. The soil here was always poisoned. I just tended it.”

She was led away into the gathering dark, leaving Elara sitting amidst the wreckage of the beautiful, deadly plants.

Constable Miller helped her up, his voice full of awed confusion. “The recorder worked a treat, Miss Bloom. We heard everything from ‘It’s a shame, Elara.’ Clear as a bell. Are you… are you alright?”

Elara nodded, unable to speak. She clutched Nutmeg to her chest, feeling the frantic beat of his heart against her own. Relief, warm and dizzying, washed over her, but it was a relief that sat atop something cold and deep. Beatrice’s final words echoed in the fragrant, ruined air.

The soil was always poisoned.

Outside, the first stars pricked through the violet sky. The village of Porthaven would sleep easier tonight, its blights, as Beatrice saw them, removed. Elara should have felt victorious. She had solved the puzzle, saved herself, protected her community.

But as she looked around at the shattered pots, the exposed roots, and the beautiful, lethal plants now glistening under the police torches, she didn’t feel like a gardener who had saved the plot. She felt like someone who had just seen the true, dark nature of the earth beneath her feet for the very first time. And the question that haunted her, as the last petal of the terrible affair fluttered down, was simple and chilling: if the soil was poisoned, what else was waiting to grow?
