Chapter 5: Framed in Ferns

The morning after the poisoned bouquet was traced to her, Elara stood in her greenhouse and tried to find solace in the ordinary. The air was thick with the scent of damp soil and green, growing things. Sunlight, filtered through the glass panes and a fine layer of coastal mist, fell in hazy columns, illuminating motes of dust that danced like tiny, carefree spirits. She was carefully pruning the spent blooms from a Pelargonium citrosum, her fingers moving with automatic precision, when the peace shattered.
“Miss Finch?”

Chief Henderson’s voice was a blunt instrument in the delicate space. He stood at the greenhouse door, his solid frame blocking the light, two uniformed officers flanking him like solemn saplings. His expression was not unkind, but it was implacable—the face of a man doing a job he didn’t relish.
“Chief,” Elara said, setting her shears down with a soft click on the potting bench. Her heart began a slow, heavy thud against her ribs. Nutmeg, who had been dozing in a patch of catmint, lifted his head, his tail twitching once.
“We have a warrant to search the premises,” Henderson said, holding out a document. “Given the nature of the deaths and the alleged purchase of the bouquet from your accounts, we need to be thorough.”

“Alleged,” Elara echoed, taking the paper. The legal jargon blurred before her eyes. “You know I didn’t order those flowers, Chief. Someone is playing a very nasty game.”

“That’s what we aim to find out,” he replied, his tone neutral. “The best thing you can do is wait in the house.”

The next hour was a peculiar form of torture. From her kitchen window, Elara watched the figures move through her greenhouse—her sanctuary, her life’s work. They were careful, she’d give them that. No pots were overturned, no seedlings trampled. But seeing their gloved hands opening drawers, peering behind shelves, lifting the edges of her propagation mats, made her feel violently exposed.
It was Officer Jenkins, a young man with earnest eyes who’d once asked her advice on reviving his fiancée’s orchid, who found it. Elara saw him pause in the far corner, the section dedicated to her collection of ferns and shade-loving curiosities. He crouched behind the massive, feathery fronds of her Dicksonia antarctica. He said something, his voice muffled by the glass and the blood rushing in Elara’s ears. Henderson moved to join him.
Elara couldn’t stay put. She walked out of the back door and across the dewy grass, her gardening clogs sinking slightly into the soft earth. She entered the greenhouse just as Henderson was straightening up, holding a small, locked metal cash box Elara had never seen before in her life. It was streaked with dirt, as if recently buried.
“Is this yours, Miss Finch?” Henderson asked, his gaze steady.
“No,” she answered, her voice surprisingly clear. “It is not.”

He produced a small tool, and with a metallic snick, the lock gave way. Inside, nestled on a bed of dry moss, were several tiny, potted plants and a stack of seed packets. Henderson lifted one. Daphne mezereum. Another: Aconitum napellus. Monkshood. Another: Ricinus communis. Castor bean. All neatly labeled. Beneath them lay a simple, black-covered notebook.
Henderson opened it. Elara, from a few feet away, could see precise, handwritten entries. D. mezereum: berries highly toxic. One berry can be fatal to a child. A. napellus: neurotoxic. Tingling, nausea, cardiac arrest. R. communis: ricin. 4-8 seeds lethal to an adult. The notes were clinical, detached. On the final page, a single line was written, the ink a different, fresher blue: For the thorny-hearted.
A cold nausea, far more potent than any plant could induce, washed over Elara. “That’s not my handwriting,” she whispered.
“It’s a good match for the order slip at the florist,” Henderson said quietly, almost apologetically. He nodded to the Daphne. “And the coroner found traces of mezerein in Mr. Thornbury’s system. Alongside the cyanide.”

The world appeared to tilt. The vibrant greens of the greenhouse bleached into a nightmare palette. “This was planted. Someone put that there. You know my greenhouse, Chief. You’ve been here for the Society’s summer tea. Does that look like it belongs?”

Henderson’s jaw tightened. He did know. He’d complimented her lemon verbena scones. “It was found on your property, Miss Finch. In a place only someone familiar with your layout would think to hide it. I’m going to need you to come down to the station for formal questioning.”

There was no handcuffing, no dramatic arrest. It was, in its way, worse. Henderson held the car door open for her like a gentleman, while the box of botanical damnation was placed in the trunk. Elara caught a glimpse of Mrs. Abernathy from number four, peering from behind her lace curtains, a hand over her mouth. The news would be all over Rosehaven before Henderson’s sedan had cleared the lane.
The interview room at the Rosehaven police station smelled of stale coffee, industrial cleaner, and anxiety. Henderson, joined by a stern female detective from the county, asked their questions with a relentless, polite persistence.
Did she keep records of poisonous plants? Only for educational purposes, and not like that. Laminated charts, not a secret notebook.
Did she have any grievance against Simon Thornbury? A professional disagreement, not a mortal one.
Did she order the bouquet sent to Flora Winthrop’s nursery? Absolutely not.
Where was her spare greenhouse key? On a hook by the back door. Usually.
They circled back, rephrased, watched her eyes. Elara clung to the truth, her answers simple and direct, though her hands trembled slightly in her lap. She like a rare, fragile specimen under a harsh microscope.
After two hours, Henderson leaned back. “You’re free to go, Miss Finch. For now.”

“For now?”

“We don’t have direct proof. The notebook isn’t signed. The box can’t be traced. The florist’s order was digital, fake. We need more evidence to convict you.”

Elara’s relief was short-lived. She stood, smoothing her skirt, trying to appear calm. But inside, a storm raged. She knew she was innocent, but the seed of doubt had been planted. Who had done this? And why?
As she walked out of the station, the bright sunlight like a slap in the face. She blinked, trying to clear her vision. The world seemed different now, tainted by the knowledge of the poisonous plants and the notebook. She quickened her pace, eager to get back to the safety of her greenhouse.
But as she turned the corner onto her street, she saw a figure waiting for her. It was a woman, tall and imposing, with a stern expression. Elara recognized her as Mrs. Flora Winthrop, the owner of the nursery where the poisoned bouquet had been delivered.
“Elara,” Mrs. Wimurmuredop said, her voice firm. “I need to talk to you. About the flowers.”

Elara’s heart sank. She knew she was in trouble. But she also knew she was innocent. She steeled herself for the confrontation ahead, her mind racing with questions. Who was behind the poisoned bouquet? And why?
“Let’s talk,” Elara said, trying to sound calm.
Mrs. Winthrop nodded, her expression unyielding. “I think we need to talk in private. Follow me.”

Elara hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do. But something about Mrs. Winthrop’s demeanor put her at ease. She nodded, and followed the woman to her car.
As they drove away from the station, Elara feelings of unease growing inside her. She knew she was in for a long and difficult conversation. But she was determined to clear her name and find out who was behind the poisoned bouquet.
The car stopped in front of a small, unassuming house on the outskirts of Rosehaven. Mrs. Winthrop turned off the engine and turned to Elara.
“Comwhispered,” she said, her voice firm. “We need to talk.”

Elara nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew she was in for a revelation. But she was ready to face it head-on.
As they entered the house, Elara saw a figure waiting for her. It was a man, tall and imposing, with a stern expression. Elara recognized him as Mr. Thornbury, the victim of the poisoned bouquet.
But something was off. Mr. Thornbury was standing, and he was smiling. Elara’s mind reeled as she tried to process what she was seeing.
“Elara,” Mr. Thornbury said, his voice warm. “I’m so glad you’re here. I think it’s time we talked.”

Elara’s eyes widened as she tried to understand what was happening. Mr. Thornbury was alive. And he was smiling at her.
But as she looked closer, she saw something that made her blood run cold. Mr. Thornbury was holding a slittle black-covered notebook. The same notebook that had been found in her greenhouse.
And on the final page, a single line was written, the ink a different, fresher blue: For the thorny-hearted.
Elara’s mind reeled as she tried to process what she was seeing. Mr. Thornbury was alive, and he was holding the notebook. But who had written it? And why?
As she looked at Mr. Thornbury, she saw something that made her heart sink. He was smiling at her, but it was a cold, calculating smile. And in his eyes, she saw a glimmer of something that chilled her to the bone.
A glimmer of recognition.
Mr. Thornbury knew her. And he knew her secrets.
Elara’s world was turned upside down as she tried to understand what was happening. But one thing was clear: she was in grave danger. And she knew she had to get out of there, fast.
She turned to Mrs. Winthrop, her eyes pleading for help. But Mrs. Winthrop was standing, her expression unyielding.
“Elara,stateds. Winthrop said, her voice firm. “I think it’s time you knew the truth. You see, Elara, you’re not who you think you are.”

Elara’s mind reeled as she tried to process what she was hearing. Who was she? What did Mrs. Winthrop mean?
As she glanced at Mrs. Winthrop, she saw something that made her blood run cold. Mrs. Winthrop was holding a small, leather-bound book. The same book that had been hidden in her greenhouse.
She turned to run, but it was too late. Mr. Thornbury was standing in front of her, his eyes cold and calculating.
“Elara,” he said, his voice firm. “You’re coming with me. We have a lot to talk about.”

Elara’s heart sank as she realized she was trapped. She was in the hands of the man who had been poisoned, and he knew her secrets. She knew she had to escape, but she didn’t know how.
As she looked around the room, she saw a glimmer of hope. A compact window, high up on the wall, was open. She could see the moon shining outside, and she knew she had to get out.
She took a deep breath, and made a run for the window. But as she reached it, she hand grab her arm. It was Mr. Thornbury, and he was holding her tight.
As shegazedd around the room, she saw a glimmer of hope. A small table, pushed against the wall, was hiding modestll key. She could see it glinting in the moonlight, and she knew she had to get it.
She took a deep breath, and made a run for the table. It was Mr.
As she looked around the room, she saw a glimmer of hope. A small door, hidden behind a pattern, was open. She could seeslightall room, and she knew she had to get in.
