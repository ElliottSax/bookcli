CHAPTER SEVEN: THE GREENHOUSE GHOST

The rain had stopped, leaving Rosehaven polished and gleaming under a hesitant sun. Droplets clung to Elara Finch's greenhouse panes like crystal beads, each one warping the world beyond into a watery, impressionist painting of her garden. Inside, the air was a thick, fragrant soup—damp earth, the peppery scent of geranium leaves, the sweet, decaying perfume of the night-blooming cereus she'd coaxed into a reluctant flower. It was a sanctuary, a place of growth and quiet logic. Tonight, she was turning it into a stage.

As she moved among the plants, the scent of damp soil and the gentle hum of the heater created a soothing melody. She felt the stress of the day seep away, allowing her to focus on the task at hand. Tonight, she was setting a trap, a delicate operation that required precision and patience. The game had been laid out, and she was determined to uncover the truth behind Grandfather's mysterious potting diary.

"It feels dishonest, Nutmeg," she confided to the terrier, who was industriously burying a rubber bone in a pot of loose potting soil. "Spreading lies in a place of truth." Nutmeg paused, gave her a look that seemed to say, You're the one who bought the bone, and resumed digging.

The lie was a delicate, poisonous seedling of its own. Elara had planted it yesterday at The Steeping Pot, over a slice of Mrs. Henderson's notoriously dense walnut cake. She'd leaned in, voice a conspiratorial murmur, to Birdie Chen, who had the auditory range of a bat and the dissemination speed of fibre-optic cable.

"I found Grandfather's old potting diary," Elara had sighed, brushing cake crumbs from her fingers. "Tucked behind a stack of The Rosehaven Gazette from 1978. Would you believe it? The notes for the 'Finch Formula' were scribbled in the margins of the July entries. All this time, it was in my own greenhouse."

Birdie's eyes had widened, her teaspoon hovering mid-stir. "The real one? Not the one the police found?"

"The real one," Elara had confirmed, injecting just the right note of weary triumph into her voice. "The one everyone killed for. It's safe. I've put it back where I found it. Sometimes the best hiding place is in plain sight, don't you think?"

By sundown, the rumor had taken root and sprouted tendrils through every garden fence and shop counter in town. Elara could feel the subtle shift in the atmosphere—the lingering glances when she bought milk, the averted eyes of Arthur Vance when she passed his immaculate, rose-encrusted gate. The bait was set.

Now, as twilight bled into a velvety, star-pricked night, she prepared the trap. She placed a weathered, leather-bound notebook—actually her grandfather's notes on combating black spot with a chamomile tea spray—on the central workbench. She angled it under the gentle glow of a single, low-wattage grow light, a spotlight on the prop. Then she retreated to her chosen blind: a shadowy corner behind a towering, fragrant Datura metel, its trumpet flowers hanging like ghostly bells. She settled on a folding stool, a warm blanket over her knees, and a thermos of strong, sweet tea. Nutmeg, sensing the change in routine, abandoned his excavations and curled at her feet, a small, warm weight of loyalty.

As the night deepened, the sound of crickets and the distant rumble of a car driving past created a soothing background hum. The first hour was a symphony of night sounds. The drip-drip-drip from the gutters, the sigh of the old boiler, the distant hoot of an owl claiming the wood. The second hour was a test of bladder and backbone. The shadows in the greenhouse deepened, the shapes of plants becoming unfamiliar, looming creatures. A philodendron leaf brushed her neck and she nearly jumped out of her skin.

"Get a grip, Finch," she muttered to herself. "You've repotted more frightening things."

It was in the deep quiet of the third hour, just as the chill was beginning to seep through the blanket, that Nutmeg stiffened. A low, almost inaudible rumble vibrated through his small body against her ankle. He didn't bark. He was a silent, coiled spring.

Elara held her breath. She heard it then—not the snick of a lock being picked, but a soft, scraping groan from the side door she had deliberately left slightly ajar. The silhouette that slipped through was not the hulking, menacing shape she'd half-expected. It was stooped, moving with a stiff, careful deliberation, one hand braced against the glass for support.

Arthur Vance paused inside the door, his breathing a ragged, wheezing sound in the humid silence. He was dressed in his usual tweed, but it was rumpled, his hair uncharacteristically disheveled. In the dim light, his face was a mask of anguish and fury. He didn't look like a murderer. He looked like a lost, furious old man.

His eyes, wide and glittering, swept the greenhouse and fixed on the notebook on the bench. He moved toward it, his steps shuffling but intent. He didn't reach for it with greed. He pulled a small, silver hip flask from his pocket, unscrewed the cap, and upended it over the pages. The sharp, acrid smell of cheap whiskey cut through the floral air.

"No," he rasped, his voice cracking. "No, no, no. You don't get to have it. You don't get to ruin it all over again."

Elara stepped from behind the Datura. "Ruin what, Arthur?"

He jerked violently, the flask clattering to the concrete floor. For a moment, sheer panic contorted his features. Then, seeing it was only her, it melted into a bitter, exhausted defiance. "You. Of course. The clever Finch. Setting a trap for the old fool."

"I was hoping for a killer," Elara said, keeping her voice level, her hands visible at her sides. "But I'll settle for an explanation. Why destroy it? I thought your family wanted the formula more than anything."

"Want—" Vance let out a sound that was half-laugh, half-sob. He gestured weakly at the soaked notebook. "My father had it. He and your grandfather developed it together. 'The Vance-Finch Synergistic Pesticide.' A formula that would make chemical sprays obsolete. A natural, targeted, completely biodegradable treatment. It would have revolutionized everything. Made a fortune, yes, but more than that... it would have been their legacy. A gift to the world from Rosehaven."

He swayed, and Elara instinctively took a step forward, but he waved her off, gripping the edge of the bench. The anger seemed to drain from him, leaving only a profound, decades-old weariness.

"Then they argued. Over credit, over percentages, over whose name came first in the patent filing. Petty, stupid pride. The partnership shattered. My father took his half of the notes. Alistair took his. Neither half was complete without the other. They spent the rest of their lives trying to reverse-engineer the other's work, or steal it back. It consumed them. It poisoned them."

Elara's mind racing, connecting the fragments she'd dug up. "Marigold Lee... she was a botanist. A specialist in natural pesticides. She was helping someone complete the formula."

Vance nodded, a slow, miserable dip of his head. "She came to me six months ago. Said she'd found some of my father's old papers in a library donation. She'd pieced together his side of the work. She offered me a deal: she'd get Alistair's half from you, by hook or by crook, and we'd finish it together. Split the proceeds. She said it was time to heal the old wound." He spat the words. "She didn't want to heal anything. She saw a payday. A big one. A global patent."

"But you didn't want it finished," Elara breathed, understanding dawning.

"I wanted it gone!" he cried, his fist coming down weakly on the bench. "This formula destroyed my father. It turned him from a brilliant, kind man into a paranoid, bitter recluse. It's the ghost that's haunted my family for forty years. When Marigold was killed... a part of me was relieved. The secret would die with her. But then that fool, the garden clerk, started nosing around, thinking he could blackmail someone. And he ended up dead. And the police found those plants in your greenhouse... I knew the ghost was still walking. I knew someone else was playing this deadly game. And then you... you had to go and 'find' it. You're stirring the pot, Elara. You're going to get yourself killed, and you're going to drag this town's rotten history into the light all over again."

His frailty was palpable. The tremor in his hands, the way he leaned his weight. This was not a man who could have overpowered the robust Marigold or the wiry young clerk. He was a man broken by a legacy, not a perpetrator of violence.

"Arthur," Elara said softly, "who did you tell about Marigold's offer? Who else knew she was close to finishing the formula?"

A flicker of fear crossed his face. "No one. I... I was ashamed. Ashamed of dealing with her, ashamed of the whole sordid business."

"Think. Your wife? A friend?"

"My wife is in Bournemouth visiting her sister!" he snapped. Then he deflated. "I... I might have mentioned it. In confidence. To someone who understood the burden. Who shared the history."

Before he could say more, a movement outside the glass caught Elara's eye. A figure, standing motionless in the moonlit knot garden. Tall, shrouded in a dark, hooded gardening cloak, face invisible in shadow. It was just... watching.

Ice water trickled down Elara's spine. "Arthur. Don't turn around. Slowly, walk towards me."

But it was too late. Vance saw the direction of her stare and turned.

The figure outside moved with sudden, terrifying purpose. Its arm drew back and then swung forward.

The crash was apocalyptic. A pane of glass directly behind Arthur exploded inward in a glittering, lethal cascade. Arthur cried out, throwing his arms over his face. Nutmeg erupted into a frenzy of barking. A rock, the size of a grapefruit, skidded across the workbench, scattering pots and tools, and came to rest at Elara's feet.

Tied around it with rough garden twine was a note.

For a frozen second, no one moved. The figure outside melted back into the shadows of the hedges and was gone. Arthur Vance stood amidst the shards, trembling, a thin trickle of blood on his cheek from a flying fragment.

Elara's heart hammered against her ribs. She knelt, her fingers fumbling with the knotted twine. She unwrapped the note, holding it under the glow of the grow light.

The message was printed in neat, blocky capitals, cut from the headlines of an old gardening catalogue.

STOP DIGGING, OR THE DOG DIGS NEXT.

A cold, pure fear, sharper than any she had felt, lanced through Elara. She wasn't the target. Not anymore. She scooped Nutmeg up, holding his warm, wriggling body close, feeling his frantic heartbeat against her own. He licked her chin, whining.

Arthur Vance stared at the message, his face ashen. "You see?" he whispered, the bravado and anger utterly extinguished. "The ghost. It's real. And you've made it angry."

Elara looked from the shattered window to the note, to the terrified old man, and finally down at the trusting, confused creature in her arms. The puzzle had just become deeply, horribly personal. The killer wasn't just in Rosehaven's past. They were here, in its present, watching from the darkness. And they had just drawn a line in the soil, right at her feet.

The game had changed. It was no longer about solving a mystery.

It was about protecting her family.

As she looked at Nutmeg, calm seemed to flood back into his body. He licked her face again, whining softly. Elara's hands trembled slightly as she cradled him close. She made a promise, a silent vow to herself and to her loved ones.

She would uncover the truth. No matter the cost.

She stood up, the note still clutched in her hand, gazing at the shards of glass scattered across the workbench. The moonlight streaming through the broken window cast an eerie glow, illuminating the treacherous, uncertain path ahead.
