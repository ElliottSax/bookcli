Chapter 9: The Poisoner's Portfolio

Chapter 9: The Poisoner’s Portfolio

The rain had finally ceased, leaving the village of Petalbrook gleaming under a tentative sun. Droplets clung to every leaf and petal like crystal beads, and the air smelled of damp earth and sweet, bruised blossoms. It was, Elara thought as she walked up the cobbled path to Beatrice Wren’s cottage, a thoroughly deceptive day. Too pretty by half.
She carried a wicker basket containing a slightly pot-bound Daphne odora and a notebook filled with deliberately clumsy sketches of her own garden. The pretext was thin, but it was the best she had: a novice gardener seeking wisdom from the village’s most respected horticultural authority. Her heart thumped a nervous rhythm against her ribs, a counterpoint to the cheerful chirping of sparrows in the dripping hawthorn hedge.
Beatrice answered the door before Elara could even knock. She wore a crisp linen smock over a tweed skirt, a pair of pruning sheeps tucked into a leather belt. Her silver hair was coiled in its usual impeccable bun, and her smile was as warm and practiced as a public monument.
“Elara, my dear. What a pleasant surprise. Come in, you’ll catch a chill.” Her voice was a smooth alto, the sort that narrated documentaries about serene landscapes.
“I hope I’m not intruding, Beatrice. I’m in a bit of a tangle with my borders, and I thought, who better to ask?” Elara hefted the basket, offering a sheepish grin.
“Nonsense, it’s always a pleasure. Tea?”

The cottage interior was a love letter to botany. Dried hydrangeas bloomed eternally in blue-and-white jugs. Framed pressed ferns adorned the walls. The air was redolent with the scent of lemon polish, beeswax, and, faintly, the peppery aroma of potting soil. It was charming, orderly, and utterly calm. The perfect lair, Elara thought, for a woman who saw murder as pruning.
They settled in a sun-drenched parlour, the Daphne between them on a low oak table. Beatrice poured Earl Grey from a pot painted with violets. “So, your borders. Is it a question of aspect, or soil?”

For twenty minutes, they discussed pH levels, companion planting, and the merits of wool mulch versus bark chippings. Beatrice was brilliant, her advice concise and poetic. She spoke of plants as personalities—the bold, sun-hungry rudbeckia, the shy, woodland-preferring foxglove. It was hypnotic. Elara had to physically shake herself to remember why she was there.
“You have such a deep connection to them,” Elara said, sipping her tea. “It’s more than knowledge. It’s like you understand their… souls.”

A faint, pleased smile touched Beatrice’s lips. “A romantic notion, but not entirely inaccurate. Plants have histories, purposes. Stories written in their sap and thorns. Some families,” she said, her gaze drifting to the window, “have forgotten the stories of the very things that made them.”

Here it was. The first delicate tendril of the true conversation.
“Like the Thornburys and their formula?” Elara asked, keeping her tone light, conversational.
Beatrice’s eyes snapped back to her, sharp as tacks. “Yes. Like that. A story of theft, dressed up as enterprise.” She set her cup down with a precise click. “You’ve been digging in that particular patch, haven’t you, Elara? Asking questions. Stirring up the compost heap.”

There was no accusation in her tone, only a gentle curiosity. It was more unnerving than a shout.
“It’s hard not to, with everything that’s happened,” Elara admitted. “Two deaths… it feels like a blight on the whole village.”

“A blight is a disease,” Beatrice corrected softly. “Sometimes, a gardener must remove diseased wood to save the tree. It’s not pleasant, but it is necessary. An act of love, for the greater organism.”

The metaphor hung in the sunlit room, ugly and undeniable. Elara decided to leap. “Beatrice, the other day, when we spoke at the show… you mentioned the Wrens have always been gardeners here. Longer than anyone.”

“Since before Petalbrook had a name,” Beatrice replied, pride straightening her spine. She stood. “You know, I think you might appreciate something. Few people do. Come with me.”

She led Elara down a short, flagstoned hallway, past a tidy kitchen, to a door that appeared to lead to a study. Instead, Beatrice unlocked it with a small key from her belt to reveal a narrow staircase descending into cool dimness. “My studio,” she said, flicking a switch. “The light is perfect from the north.”

The basement room was not a dank cellar but a spacious, white-walled sanctuary. A massive drafting table stood under a bank of LED lights, its surface carefully clean. But it was the walls that stole Elara’s breath. They were lined with framed botanical illustrations.
They were not prints. They were original paintings, each a masterpiece of detail and luminosity. A sprig of oleander, every vein on its deadly leaf rendered, the pale pink blossoms almost glowing against the vellum. Monkshood, its hooded blue flowers sinister and regal. Foxglove, bell-shaped blooms marching up a slender stalk. Lily of the valley, delicate and deceptively sweet. Death cap mushroom, rendered in terrifying, slimy authenticity.
Each painting was more breathtaking than the last. The skill was staggering—the velvety texture of a petal, the precise serration of a leaf, the subtle gradation of colour from stem to tip. They were beautiful. And they were a gallery of poisons.
“Beatrice, these are… extraordinary,” Elara whispered, her mouth dry.
“Thank you. A lifelong hobby. I won a few awards in my youth.” Beatrice gestured to a small glass cabinet where gold and silver medals gleamed dully. “The Royal Horticultural Society, the Society of Botanical Artists… they appreciated the precision. They never asked about the subject matter.”

Elara moved slowly along the wall, her senses screaming. Then she stopped. The third painting in the row was of a thorny, elegant stem bearing a single, perfect white flower with a crimson-stained centre. Atropa belladonna. Deadly nightshade. In the bottom right-hand corner, in Beatrice’s elegant, copperplate script, was the title: ‘Justice in Bloom I.’

Her pulse became a drum in her ears. She forced her feet to move. Next was a stunning painting of a castor bean plant, its spiny seed pods split to reveal the beautiful, deadly beans within. The title: ‘Justice in Bloom II.’

Belladonna. Thornbury.
Castor Bean. Marigold Lee.
She turned to Beatrice, who was watching her with an expression of serene expectation, like a teacher waiting for a pupil to grasp a difficult theorem.
“You title your work,” Elara managed.
“I do. The title is part of the story.” Beatrice walked forward and stopped before a third, unfinished painting on the drafting table. It was of a yew tree branch, its fleshy red arils bright against the dark green, needle-like leaves. Every part toxic, save the berry’s flesh. A work in progress. The paper was blank where the title would go.
Elara’s mind raced. Yew. The third family. The Pargeters. Simon Pargeter, the last living direct descendant of the original trio who stole the formula.
“The stories these plants could tell,” Beatrice murmured, tracing the edge of the yew painting with a stained finger. “My great-great-grandmother, Eleanor Wren, was a brilliant chemist. A self-taught genius with plants. She developed the original growth formula in this very village. It was her life’s work. She meant to share it, to help everyone’s crops flourish.”

Her voice, for the first time, lost its polished smoothness. A raw, centuries-old bitterness seeped through. “Then the three young bucks from ‘good families’ came calling. Thornbury, Lee, and Pargeter. They saw her vulnerability—a brilliant woman with no name, no fortune, no husband. They wooed her with promises of partnership, of legacy. They stole her notes, her research, and patented the formula under their own names. They built their fortunes, their manor houses, their precious Garden Show, on her stolen labour. They erased her.”

Elara saw it then, not as a dusty historical footnote, but as a living, festering wound. The injustice, passed down through generations of Wren women, distilled into a pure, patient venom.
“And no one knew?” Elara asked.
“Oh, the families knew. It was their dirty little secret. A private joke. ‘Don’t cross the Wren women, they have long memories.’ Th answered it with a smile, while they paid us to tend their gardens, to arrange their flowers, to be the ‘help.’ We were the gardeners of their stolen Eden.” Beatrice picked up a fine sable brush, testing its point. “My mother told me the story on her deathbed. She said to let it go. That honour was a luxury for the rich. But I looked at those families, at their corruption, their greed… Thornbury with his exploitative rents, Marigold Lee poisoning the land with her cut-price chemicals, Simon Pargeter, ready to sell the last piece of our heritage to the highest bidder… They were a canker. And a gardener removes the canker.”

The confession wasn’t a confession. It was a manifesto, delivered with the calm certainty of a natural law.
“You killed them,”murmuredra said, the words flat in the still room.
Beatrice didn’t flinch. “I pruned the tree. I restored balance. Thornbury’s belladonna in his prize-winning ‘innocent’ gin. Marigold’s castor bean oil in her own ‘artisanal’ face cream. Poetic, don’t you think? They were poisoned by the extremely legacy they stole.” She glanced at the yew painting. “The tree is not yet clean.”

A cold terror, deeper than any she’d before, seeped into Elara’s bones. This wasn’t a crime of passion or a sudden, violent rage. This was a decades-long project, executed with the precision and patience of a master artisan. There would be no dramatic slip-up, no forgotten fingerprint. Beatrice Wren was an artist, and her portfolio was complete save for one final piece.
“You’re telling me all this because you think I can’t stop you,” Elara said.
“I’m telling you because you understand,” Beatrice corrected, her eyes locking onto Elara’s. There was a frightening intensity there, a fanatic’s glow. “You love this village. You see its true heart. You moved here for the community, the beauty, the story. I am protecting that story. I am weeding the garden.”

“You’re murdering people!”

“I am administering justice. The kind that never comes from courtrooms or solicitors.” Beatrice sighed, as if Elara were a bright child being deliberately obtuse. “I know you’ve been looking. The fake visitor, the garden clerk… you’re getting warm. I knew you would. You have a terrier’s spirit. But ask yourself, Elara: is the world poorer for the loss of a grasping landlord and a environmental vandal? Or is it cleaner?”

She replaced the brush and turned, her demeanour shifting back to the kindly neighbour. “Now, I think we’re done with your Daphne question, aren’t we? It’s a lovely plant. Fragrant. But also toxic, if ingested. One must always respect the power of beautiful things.”

The dismissal was clear. Elara was desperate to be out of that pristine, poison-filled basement. She strode back up the stairs on legs that like straw, Beatrice following silently behind.
At the front door, the older woman placed a hand on Elara’s arm. Her grip was firm, dry, strong from a lifetime of digging. “Be careful where you dig, my dear. Some roots are deep. And whispered,” she said, her gaze dropping meaningfully to where Nutmeg was undoubtedly snoozing on Elara’s sofa a few streets away, “are delicate and easily crushed.”

The threat was as elegant and deadly as her paintings. Elara pulled her arm away, managed a stiff nod, and stumbled out into the too-bright afternoon.
She walked home in a daze, the charming cottages and blooming gardens now seeming like a painted backdrop to a chilling play. She was certain. Utterly, completely certain. And utterly, completely powerless. What did she have? Metaphors about pruning and a theory about historical theft. DCI Evans would laugh her out of the station. Beatrice Wren was Petalbrook’s beloved treasure. Elara was the newcomer with a corgi and an overactive imagination.
Back at Bramble Cottage, she locked the door and sank to the floor, pulling a wriggling, welcoming Nutmeg into her lap. She buried her face in his fur, seeking his simple, uncomplicated love. “Oh, Nutmeg,” she whispered. “What do I do?”

The answer came not in a moment of inspiration, but as a vibration in her pocket. Her phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number.
No words. Just a picture. A photograph of the now-dark and empty Petalbrook Garden Show pavilion, its striped canvas flapping in a night wind. The timestamp on the image read 23:55.
Beneath it, a second message appeared, typing itself out in real time as she watched.
The final exhibit is ready for viewing. Midnight. Come alone. Let’s see if you appreciate the full story. —B.
Then, a second image downloaded: a snapshot, taken from the lane, of Bramble Cottage’s front garden, Nutmeg’s favourite chew toy visible on the path. The message was as clear as the titles on the paintings.
The final showdown was not an invitation. It was a summons. And the stakes, Elara knew, were no longer just about justice for the past, but survival for the future. All of it—hers, Nutmeg’s, Simon Pargeter’s—would be decided under the dark canvas of the pavilion at midnight.
