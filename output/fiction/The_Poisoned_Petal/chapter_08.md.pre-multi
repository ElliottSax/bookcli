Chapter 8: Nutmeg in Peril

Chapter 8: Nutmeg in Peril

The fear was a cold, slick thing in Elara’s stomach, entirely different from the hot rush of being accused. This was slower, more insidious. It uncoiled as she watched Nutmeg snuffle contentedly around the base of the hydrangeas, his pumpkin-shaped rump wiggling with simple joy. Someone had looked at that joy, that absolute trust, and seen a lever. A weapon to be used against her.

The police had left her greenhouse in a state of respectful disarray, having taken the planted notebook and the suspiciously convenient cache of wolfsbane and death cap mushrooms. Detective Miller’s apology had been perfunctory; the doubt in his eyes, however, had been professionally polished and put back on display. Elara felt scraped raw, her sanctuary violated twice over—first by the killer, then by the law.

“Come on, you little loaf,” she murmured, tapping her thigh. Nutmeg trotted over, his nails clicking a cheerful rhythm on the flagstone path, and leaned his full weight against her leg. She crouched, burying her face in the warm, wheat-and-honey scent of his fur. “What would I do without you, hm?”

The answer was unthinkable. And that, she realized with a jolt, was precisely the point. The threat wasn’t just to her freedom, but to her heart. For a dizzying moment, standing there in the twilight, the idea of stopping, of packing a bag and driving somewhere with no gardens and no gossip, was profoundly seductive. Let the village think her guilty. Let the killer win. Nutmeg’s safety was worth more than her pride.

She was still wrestling with this cowardly impulse the next morning. The world seemed sharper, more dangerous. A fallen branch in the yard made her jump; the postman’s cheerful wave seemed laden with hidden meaning. She kept Nutmeg on a lead even in their own walled garden, much to his dignified confusion.

“It’s for your own good, you dramatic sausage,” she told him as he sighed, plopping down on the lawn to glare at a sparrow. “My nerves can’t take any more surprises.”

The universe, it seemed, was in a mischievous mood.

She’d gone inside to fetch the kettle, leaving the French doors ajar for the spring air. It was a sixty-second absence. When she returned, teacup in hand, Nutmeg was not on the lawn. A bolt of pure panic shot through her before she saw him, over by the compost bin in the shaded corner, his body a tense, interested curve. He was nosing at something dark and ragged on the ground.

“Nutmeg! Leave it!” Her voice cracked with a terror she hadn’t known she possessed.

He glanced up, the object—a chunk of raw, gristly steak—clamped gently in his jaws. His tail gave a tentative wag. Look what I found!

“DROP IT!” The command was a shriek. He flinched, surprised, and the meat fell from his mouth. Elara covered the distance in a sprint, swooping him up and away from the spot. He squirmed in her arms, licking her chin, confused by the fuss. She set him down inside and slammed the door, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird.

With a pair of salad tongs and a zip-lock bag, she retrieved the meat. It looked ordinary, but a faint, sweet, almond-like scent clung to it, barely perceptible beneath the iron-rich smell of blood. Cyanide. Probably from cherry laurel leaves, crushed and infused. A gardener’s poison. Quick, brutal, and undeniably meant for her dog.

She leaned against the cool stone of the house, the baggie held away from her body as if it were radioactive. The cold fear in her stomach evaporated, burned away by a white-hot fury. They had come into her garden. They had known where Nutmeg would sniff, had known his routines—the compost bin was where she sometimes discarded wilted lettuce, a favorite treat of his. They knew her. They knew that to break Elara Finch, you didn’t target her; you targeted her dog.

Backing down was no longer an option. The killer had, with this clumsy, cruel act, signed their own warrant.

“Right,” she said aloud, her voice steady now. Nutmeg, sensing the shift, pressed against her legs. “Game on.”

She spent the afternoon not in the garden, but at her kitchen table, surrounded by a spread of notes, photographs, and her own chaotic mind maps. The planted evidence in the greenhouse required access, yes. But this? This required intimacy.

She re-examined every piece of the puzzle through this new, horrifying lens.

The Gloves: Her favorite gardening gloves, smeared with soil from Marigold’s pot, found tucked behind a bag of potting mix in her own shed. Someone had taken them from the basket by her back door, used them, and returned them. Someone who knew she owned them, where she kept them, and that she used them for repotting.

The Key: The spare key to Marigold’s conservatory, “discovered” in the pocket of her waxed jacket hanging in her own hall closet. Only a handful of people knew she’d even had one, borrowed months ago to water Marigold’s orchids during a weekend trip.

The Dog Treats: Nutmeg’s homemade, liver-and-parsley biscuits. The killer had used them to lure Marigold’s terrier, Pip, away from the scene. The recipe was her own, shared only at the Garden Society’s summer fête bake-off. The winner had been… Beatrice Croft. Beatrice had even asked for the recipe afterward, claiming her nephew’s dog was a fussy eater.

A pattern, delicate as a spider’s web, began to glisten.

Each act required two things: effortless access to Elara’s home and life, and deep, specific botanical knowledge. The poison used on Marigold was a refined, complex mixture. The cherry laurel on the meat was a simpler, blunter instrument, but still required knowing which plant to use, how to prepare it.

Her suspect list, which had once included half the village, shrank and refined itself. It had to be someone in the inner Garden Society circle. Someone who moved through her house with the casual privilege of a friend. Someone who knew Nutmeg’s habits, her glove basket, her jacket pockets, her recipe file. Someone who could identify a poisonous plant in the dark and had the skill to extract its venom.

The faces floated before her: Arthur Penhaligon, the tweedy, meticulous Society treasurer. Fiona Briggs, the sharp-eyed head of the floral competition committee. Geraldine Hooper, the retired botany teacher whose knowledge was both deep and dangerously academic. And Beatrice Croft, the Society’s formidable secretary, whose “green thumb” was legendary and whose organizational skills ran the group with an iron fist in a velvet glove.

Beatrice. Who had asked for the dog treat recipe. Who had a key to the Society’s tool shed where rare plants were sometimes housed. Who had been the one to “discover” Marigold’s body, her scream summoning the entire street. Who had been so helpfully adamant about Elara’s guilt from the very beginning.

Elara’s staged discovery of the “missing formula” was already in motion—a carefully leaked rumor to Arthur that she’d found Marigold’s secret notes tucked inside a gardening manual. The trap was set. But now, holding the tainted meat, she felt a new urgency. The killer was getting desperate, their moves becoming less calculated, more personal.

The doorbell chimed, a bright, incongruous sound in the tense atmosphere of the kitchen. Nutmeg gave a half-hearted woof and trotted to the hall.

Elara’s blood ran cold. Peering through the side window, she saw Beatrice Croft standing on the front step, a wicker basket draped over one arm, her expression one of concerned benevolence.

Smoothing her own face into a mask of weary distress, Elara opened the door. “Beatrice. What a surprise.”

“Elara, my dear,” Beatrice said, her voice a syrup of sympathy. “I heard about the dreadful business with the police search. The whole village is buzzing, and not in a pleasant way. I thought you could use some comfort.” She hefted the basket. “I’ve brought scones. My grandmother’s recipe, with a dash of my own secret ingredient.”

The woman swept in, her floral perfume (lily of the valley, Elara noted automatically—beautiful, toxic) filling the hallway. She made straight for the kitchen, as if she owned the place. “Now, you sit. I’ll put the kettle on. You look absolutely peaky.”

“It’s been… a strain,” Elara said, allowing herself to be ushered to a chair. Nutmeg circled Beatrice’s legs, sniffing the basket hopefully.

“Of course it has! To have your own sanctuary violated like that.” Beatrice clucked her tongue, unpacking the basket with efficient grace. A linen napkin, a pot of clotted cream, a jar of homemade strawberry jam, and a stack of perfect, golden scones emerged. “And then that nasty business with the dog treats being used to lure poor Pip away. It makes one’s blood run cold.”

“Yes,” Elara said quietly, watching her. “It does.”

Beatrice busied herself with the teacups. “I was just saying to Geraldine yesterday, only someone with a truly twisted mind, and a particular knowledge of botany, would think to use cyanogenic glycosides in such a way. So crude, compared to what was used on poor Marigold. A different class of poison entirely.”

The kitchen went very quiet. The only sound was the soft hiss of the kettle coming to a boil.

Elara felt the world tilt, the pieces slotting into place with an almost audible click. The police had never released the specific details of the poison used on Marigold. The official statement said “plant-based toxin.” The local paper had speculated about “gardener’s know-how.” Cyanogenic glycosides was the precise, scientific term for the compounds found in cherry laurel, peach pits, and apple seeds—the family of the poison left for Nutmeg.

A knowledge that went beyond village gossip. A knowledge that matched the killer’s profile perfectly.

Beatrice turned, holding the teapot, her smile serene. “Sugar, dear?”

Elara met her eyes. The concern in them was flawless, a masterpiece of deception. But beneath it, in the slight, fixed tightness at the corners of her mouth, Elara saw something else. A watchful, calculating coldness. The same coldness that could plot a murder, frame a neighbor, and calmly leave poisoned meat for a corgi.

“No, thank you,” Elara said, her own smile feeling brittle as a dried leaf. “I find I’ve quite lost my taste for sweet things.”

The hook: As Beatrice prattles on about village support, Elara notices a tiny, vibrant green smear on the cuff of her cardigan—the exact shade of Gloriosa supera pollen, the rare, spectacularly toxic climbing lily that was the centerpiece of Marigold Lee’s award-winning, and now missing, final display.
