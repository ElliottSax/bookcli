Chapter 5: Framed in Ferns

Chapter 5: Framed in Ferns

The morning after the poisoned bouquet was traced to her, Elara stood in her greenhouse and tried to find solace in the ordinary. The air was thick with the scent of damp soil and green, growing things. Sunlight, filtered through the glass panes and a fine layer of coastal mist, fell in hazy columns, illuminating motes of dust that danced like tiny, carefree spirits. She was meticulously pruning the spent blooms from a Pelargonium citrosum, her fingers moving with automatic precision, when the peace shattered.

“Miss Finch?”

Chief Henderson’s voice was a blunt instrument in the delicate space. He stood at the greenhouse door, his solid frame blocking the light, two uniformed officers flanking him like solemn saplings. His expression was not unkind, but it was implacable—the face of a man doing a job he didn’t relish.

“Chief,” Elara said, setting her shears down with a soft click on the potting bench. Her heart began a slow, heavy thud against her ribs. Nutmeg, who had been dozing in a patch of catmint, lifted his head, his tail twitching once.

“We have a warrant to search the premises,” Henderson said, holding out a document. “Given the nature of the deaths and the alleged purchase of the bouquet from your accounts, we need to be thorough.”

“Alleged,” Elara echoed, taking the paper. The legal jargon blurred before her eyes. “You know I didn’t order those flowers, Chief. Someone is playing a very nasty game.”

“That’s what we aim to find out,” he said, his tone neutral. “The best thing you can do is wait in the house.”

The next hour was a peculiar form of torture. From her kitchen window, Elara watched the figures move through her greenhouse—her sanctuary, her life’s work. They were careful, she’d give them that. No pots were overturned, no seedlings trampled. But seeing their gloved hands opening drawers, peering behind shelves, lifting the edges of her propagation mats, made her feel violently exposed.

It was Officer Jenkins, a young man with earnest eyes who’d once asked her advice on reviving his fiancée’s orchid, who found it. Elara saw him pause in the far corner, the section dedicated to her collection of ferns and shade-loving curiosities. He crouched behind the massive, feathery fronds of her Dicksonia antarctica. He said something, his voice muffled by the glass and the blood rushing in Elara’s ears. Henderson moved to join him.

Elara couldn’t stay put. She walked out of the back door and across the dewy grass, her gardening clogs sinking slightly into the soft earth. She entered the greenhouse just as Henderson was straightening up, holding a small, locked metal cash box Elara had never seen before in her life. It was streaked with dirt, as if recently buried.

“Is this yours, Miss Finch?” Henderson asked, his gaze steady.

“No,” she said, her voice surprisingly clear. “It is not.”

He produced a small tool, and with a metallic snick, the lock gave way. Inside, nestled on a bed of dry moss, were several small, potted plants and a stack of seed packets. Henderson lifted one. Daphne mezereum. Another: Aconitum napellus. Monkshood. Another: Ricinus communis. Castor bean. All neatly labeled. Beneath them lay a simple, black-covered notebook.

Henderson opened it. Elara, from a few feet away, could see precise, handwritten entries. D. mezereum: berries highly toxic. One berry can be fatal to a child. A. napellus: neurotoxic. Tingling, nausea, cardiac arrest. R. communis: ricin. 4-8 seeds lethal to an adult. The notes were clinical, detached. On the final page, a single line was written, the ink a different, fresher blue: For the thorny-hearted.

A cold nausea, far more potent than any plant could induce, washed over Elara. “That’s not my handwriting,” she whispered.

“It’s a good match for the order slip at the florist,” Henderson said quietly, almost apologetically. He nodded to the Daphne. “And the coroner found traces of mezerein in Mr. Thornbury’s system. Alongside the cyanide.”

The world seemed to tilt. The vibrant greens of the greenhouse bleached into a nightmare palette. “This was planted. Someone put that there. You know my greenhouse, Chief. You’ve been here for the Society’s summer tea. Does that look like it belongs?”

Henderson’s jaw tightened. He did know. He’d complimented her lemon verbena scones. “It was found on your property, Miss Finch. In a place only someone familiar with your layout would think to hide it. I’m going to need you to come down to the station for formal questioning.”

There was no handcuffing, no dramatic arrest. It was, in its way, worse. Henderson held the car door open for her like a gentleman, while the box of botanical damnation was placed in the trunk. Elara caught a glimpse of Mrs. Abernathy from number four, peering from behind her lace curtains, a hand over her mouth. The news would be all over Rosehaven before Henderson’s sedan had cleared the lane.

The interview room at the Rosehaven police station smelled of stale coffee, industrial cleaner, and anxiety. Henderson, joined by a stern female detective from the county, asked their questions with a relentless, polite persistence.

Did she keep records of poisonous plants? Only for educational purposes, and not like that. Laminated charts, not a secret notebook.
Did she have any grievance against Simon Thornbury? A professional disagreement, not a mortal one.
Did she order the bouquet sent to Flora Winthrop’s nursery? Absolutely not.
Where was her spare greenhouse key? On a hook by the back door. Usually.

They circled back, rephrased, watched her eyes. Elara clung to the truth, her answers simple and direct, though her hands trembled slightly in her lap. She felt like a rare, fragile specimen under a harsh microscope.

After two hours, Henderson leaned back. “You’re free to go, Miss Finch. For now.”

“For now?”

“We don’t have direct proof. The notebook isn’t signed. The box can’t be traced. The florist’s order was digital, from your email, but from a public library computer. There are no witnesses placing you at either scene.” He sounded almost frustrated. “It’s all circumstantial, but it’s a mighty large pile of circumstance. Don’t leave town.”

Elara walked out of the station into the late afternoon light, feeling strangely weightless and soiled. The charm of Rosehaven’s high street seemed like a painted backdrop. The ‘Ye Olde Tea Shoppe’ sign creaked in the breeze, a hollow sound. She passed the window of ‘Petals & Posies,’ the new florist where the deadly bouquet had originated. Inside, she saw the owner, a wan young woman, talking animatedly to a customer. Their eyes flicked to Elara, then darted away. The conversation hushed.

She decided to walk to the community garden, a patchwork quilt of plots behind the village hall. The Rosehaven Garden Society would be there, tending to the communal beds for the upcoming Spring Fling. She needed her friends, their sturdy, dirt-under-the-fingernails normalcy.

She heard them before she saw them: the familiar cadence of Marjorie Peabody’s laugh, the low rumble of old Tom Benton’s voice. As she rounded the corner of the hall, the group came into view—Marjorie deadheading roses, Tom staking tomatoes, Beatrice Crofton on her knees, weeding the herb spiral.

Their conversation died the moment they saw her. It wasn’t a natural pause; it was a severance. Tom looked down, suddenly engrossed in a tomato leaf. Beatrice sat back on her heels, wiping her hands on her apron, her smile tight and fleeting.

It was Marjorie who spoke, her usual effusiveness strained. “Elara, dear. We heard. What a dreadful… misunderstanding.”

“It is a misunderstanding, Marjorie,” Elara said, her voice sounding too bright, too desperate in her own ears. “Someone is framing me.”

“Of course, of course,” Marjorie said, not meeting her eyes. “It’s just… well, with two people dead, and that box in your ferns… Chief Henderson was asking us all sorts of questions, you know. About your… interests.”

“My interests?” Elara felt a chill.

“The poisonous plants, dear,” Beatrice said quietly, her eyes full of a pained sympathy that was worse than outright accusation. “You do have such specialized knowledge. We never thought anything of it before, but now…”

“But now it looks bad,” Tom finished, his voice gruff with discomfort. “Best let the police sort it, Elara. We’ve got the Fling to think about. Can’t have the Society associated with… well.”

It was a dismissal. Gentle, regretful, but absolute. They were distancing themselves, pulling their communal warmth back from the sudden, dangerous cold that surrounded her. Elara stood there, isolated on the path, the vibrant garden before her feeling like an exhibit she was no longer allowed to touch.

“Right,” she said softly. “The Fling. Wouldn’t want to spoil it.”

She turned and walked away, the weight of their silent suspicion a physical pressure between her shoulder blades.

Back in the cottage, the silence was a roaring thing. Nutmeg wove around her ankles, a warm, purring comfort. The police search, while tidy, had left a psychic disarray. Drawers were perfectly closed, but she felt the ghost of their intrusion everywhere.

Intimate knowledge. The phrase Henderson had used about the hiding spot hammered in her mind. Not just a passing familiarity, but an intimate knowledge of her greenhouse layout, her habits, her collection. Who had that?

The Society members, of course. A few trusted neighbors. The delivery boy. The man who serviced the glass panes. A list began to form in her head, but it felt hopeless.

Then she remembered the logbook.

It was a whimsical thing, a beautiful leather-bound journal gifted to her by the Society on the greenhouse’s fifth anniversary. For your visitors, the inscription read. Human and hummingbird alike. She kept it on a stand just inside the door, with a pen on a string. Friends, fellow enthusiasts, even curious tourists were encouraged to sign in. She loved reading the comments: ‘The vanilla scent of the heliotrope is divine!’ or ‘Your Nepenthes terrarium is a wonder!’

It was a record of access. Of presence.

She fetched it now, the leather cool under her fingers. Nutmeg jumped onto the kitchen table, watching as she began to turn the pages, starting from the date of Simon Thornbury’s death and working backwards. Days blurred by in a cascade of familiar names and cheerful notes. Marjorie, Tom, Beatrice. The vicar. The school gardening club.

Then, a week before Thornbury died, she saw it.

The entry was for a Tuesday afternoon, around 3 PM. The name was “A. Foxglove.” The comment read: ‘Admiring the foliage. Thank you for the hospitality.’

Elara’s breath caught. Foxglove. Digitalis. A beautiful, deadly plant. A joke? A brazen clue? The handwriting was a deliberate, looping script, unlike any regular visitor’s.

She checked her own calendar for that Tuesday. She’d been at a rare plant auction in the county town all afternoon. She’d left the greenhouse unlocked, as she often did when just popping out for an hour or two, but this had been a four-hour trip. She’d mentioned her plans at the Society meeting the previous week. Anyone could have known she’d be gone.

Her eyes drifted to the hook by the back door, where her spare key usually hung. It was there now. But with a jolt, she recalled Henderson’s question: Where was your spare greenhouse key?

She’d said ‘usually’ on the hook. Because sometimes it wasn’t. Sometimes, if she was working in the far garden, she’d take it with her so as not to have to circle back to the house. She had a specific memory of that Tuesday morning, before leaving for the auction. She’d been potting up seedlings in the raised beds. It had been drizzling. She’d taken the spare key from its hook and slipped it into the pocket of her waxed jacket.

A cold certainty crystallized. She hadn’t used the key that day. She’d come in through the house after the auction, tired, her arms full of new acquisitions. She’d hung her jacket in the mudroom. The key…

She walked to the mudroom now, a small, brick-floored space off the kitchen. Her waxed jacket still hung there. She plunged her hand into the right pocket. Empty. The left. Nothing but a few bits of grit and a twisted twine.

The key had been in that pocket. And after that Tuesday, she’d never consciously used it or seen it. She’d simply assumed, when she’d glanced at the hook later, that she’d returned it. But she hadn’t.

“Someone took it,” she whispered to Nutmeg, who blinked his amber eyes slowly. “A. Foxglove took my spare key from my jacket pocket while I was at the auction. They used it to get in and plant that box. And then…”

And then they would have needed to return it, or its absence might be noticed. But when? The police search was today. The key was on its hook when Henderson asked about it. So it had been returned sometime between that Tuesday and this morning.

Her heart began to pound again, a frantic, hopeful rhythm. The logbook gave a fake name, but it was a timestamp. The key’s disappearance was a tangible event. It was a thread, fine as a spider’s silk, but she had it.

Exhaustion suddenly crashed over her. The emotional whiplash of the day—the shock of the discovery, the chill of the interrogation, the ache of her friends’ distance—left her drained. She made a cup of tea she didn’t taste, fed Nutmeg, and moved through the cottage in a daze, turning off lights.

In the dark kitchen, the only illumination came from the pale moonlight through the window over the sink. She was about to head upstairs when a faint, metallic glint caught her eye.

There, in the very center of her scrubbed pine kitchen table, where no such object had been an hour ago, lay a single, tarnished silver key.

Her spare greenhouse key.

It hadn’t been on the hook. It was here. Placed here while she sat in the next room, grieving her upended life.

Someone had been in her house. Tonight.

The thread in her hand didn’t feel like a lifeline anymore. It felt like a leash. And somewhere in the friendly, shadowed streets of Rosehaven, the other end was held by a killer who had just walked through her door, and left a calling card.
