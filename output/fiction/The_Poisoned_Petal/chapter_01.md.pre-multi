Chapter 1: A Fatal Bloom

On the morning of the Rosehaven Garden Show, pristine, golden-light perfection dawned, as if personally commissioned by the town council. Elara Finch, however, wrestled with a small, stubborn, and notably un-golden source of chaos.

“Nutmeg, for the last time, you cannot wear the hat.”

Before the discarded straw boater, the corgi sat, a study in toasted-bread-coloured fur with white socks, her expression one of profound betrayal. Her usually alert satellite-dish ears drooped.

“It obscures your vision,” Elara reasoned, slipping her own wide-brimmed hat onto her head. “You’d walk straight into a prize-winning delphinium and cause an international incident. Besides, you’re a working dog today. My nose, but furrier.”

Nutmeg huffed, a sound like a damp sneeze, conceding defeat. Clicking a cheerful rhythm on the flagstone path, she trotted after Elara out of the cottage. A symphony of scent filled the air: the peppery wake-up call of nicotiana from Elara’s own borders, the drowsy sweetness of honeysuckle from next door, and beneath it all, the rich, damp-earth smell of a town in full, blooming riot.

Rosehaven in summer resembled a postcard that had gotten deliciously out of hand. Over limestone walls, climbing roses cascaded in froths of pink and cream. Neat front gardens burst with colour-coordinated confidence. Today, the entire horticultural energy of the county focused on the village green, transformed for the annual show.

First came the noise—a happy, buzzing hum of voices, the clink of teacups from the WI tent, and the occasional burst of laughter. Then the colours arrived: stripes of marquee canvas against the blue sky, banks of flowers on display tables, and the dizzying kaleidoscope of summer dresses and linen suits. Nutmeg’s tail became a metronome set to prestissimo.

“Elara! Over here!”

From behind a table groaning with jars of chutney and architectural loaves of bread, Beatrice “Bea” Cho, Rosehaven’s librarian and Elara’s closest friend, waved. Her t-shirt read, “Shhh… I’m Gardening.”

“I see you’ve been demoted from literature to legumes,” Elara said, kissing Bea’s cheek.

“Temporary exile. I criticised Mrs. Pembroke’s Victoria sponge last year. Said it had the structural integrity of a damp napkin. She’s head judge for baked goods this year. Coincidence? I think not.” Bea’s eyes twinkled behind her glasses. “Oh, hello, you glorious loaf.” Bending to scratch Nutmeg’s favourite spot at the base of her spine, she sent the corgi’s hind leg thumping against the grass.

“Any scandals brewing?” Elara adjusted her hat.

“The usual simmering pot. Old Man Henderson is convinced someone swapped his prize leek for a genetically modified impostor. The Dahlia Society is in a cold war over judging bias. And Gerald Thornbury is already making a spectacle of himself.”

As if summoned by the mention of discord, a raised voice sliced through the ambient chatter. Councilman Gerald Thornbury, a tall, thin man who carried himself as if he were a rare and fragile orchid, was poking a finger towards the chest of Horace Briggs, the show’s organizer and owner of the local garden centre.

“—absolutely not up to code, Briggs! This marquee rope is a public hazard! I could have it shut down!”

Horace, a man built like a friendly oak stump, went a mottled red. “It’s been fine for forty years, Gerald. The only hazard here is your blood pressure.”

“Insolence! I’ll see your permit revoked!”

Spinning on his heel, Thornbury swept his gaze for another target. It landed on a petite, fierce-looking woman in mud-stained trousers guarding a display of exquisite, alien-looking orchids. Moira Shrike, Thornbury’s neighbour and perennial rival for ‘Best Overall Garden’.

“Moira,” Thornbury said, his voice dripping with faux civility. “I see you’ve entered the Phalaenopsis. A brave choice, given the mite infestation you reported last month. Or was that just a ploy to lower expectations?”

Without looking up from meticulously adjusting a petal, Moira replied, “The only infestation I’m concerned about, Gerald, is the one of pompous blowhards. Do move along, you’re blocking the light for my Cattleya.”

Thornbury’s lips tightened into a white line. He moved on, a storm cloud in a seersucker suit.

“Charming as ever,” Bea murmured. “He’s voted against the children’s playground extension, you know. Says it’ll increase ‘unseemly noise’. The man hates joy.”

Watching Thornbury’s progress, Elara saw him as a splinter in the town’s thumb—small, but causing a disproportionate amount of irritation. He’d opposed Bea’s library renovation, tried to block Elara’s own application to build a small potting shed, and was generally the first to say ‘no’ to any proposal that involved community fun or spending a single penny of council money.

“Come on,” Elara said to Nutmeg. “Let’s see the roses before the judging frenzy.”

The rose pavilion formed the heart of the show. Inside, the air hung thick, almost syrupy, with a hundred different perfumes—citrusy, fruity, myrrh-scented, classic old-rose. Sunlight streamed through the canvas, illuminating drifts of pollen motes. They found Bertie, Elara’s octogenarian neighbour, crouched before a specimen of a perfect, buttery yellow rose.

“Ah, the cavalry arrives!” Bertie wheezed, straightening up with a series of clicks. “What do you think, Elara? ‘Graham Thomas’. A beauty, but has it got the oomph?”

“It’s stunning, Bertie. But the competition is fierce.” Drawn to a display at the very centre of the pavilion, Elara’s eyes fixed on a single rose plant grown in a simple terracotta pot. The blooms held a colour so deep a purple it was nearly black at the heart, bleeding to a velvety magenta at the edges of the petals. A small, calligraphed card read: *“Rosa ‘Midnight Siren’. Exhibitor: Anonymous.”

Around it, a crowd gathered, murmuring in awe.

“Never seen anything like it,” Bertie confessed. “Rumour is it’s a secret hybrid from one of the big houses. Smells like heaven and heartbreak, they say.”

It was at that moment Councilman Thornbury entered the pavilion. The convivial noise dimmed a few degrees. He ignored the social frost, his eyes laser-locked on the purple rose. He pushed through the small crowd with an entitled air.

“Now this,” he announced to no one in particular, “is what excellence looks like. Not that sentimental clutter.” He waved a dismissive hand at Bertie’s yellow rose.

He leaned in close to the ‘Midnight Siren’, his hands clasped behind his back. “Magnificent structure. Incredible colour saturation.” He closed his eyes, a connoisseur about to sample a fine wine, and buried his nose deep into the fullest, most perfect bloom.

He inhaled, a long, deep, theatrical draught.

For a second, he was still. Then his eyes flew open. They were wide, confused. A strange, choked gurgle escaped his lips. His hands, fluttering up from behind his back, clutched at his throat. The rich colour drained from his face, leaving it the grey of old putty.

“I… I can’t…” he rasped.

He took one staggering step back, his legs buckling. He collapsed onto the grass matting of the pavilion floor, a marionette with its strings cut. The seersucker suit settled around him like a deflated balloon.

A woman screamed. A teacup shattered. For a heartbeat, there was absolute, stunned silence, broken only by the cheerful buzz of a bee investigating a nearby ‘Queen of Sweden’.

Then chaos erupted.

Horace Briggs bellowed for someone to call an ambulance. Bea, who had rushed in at the commotion, dropped to her knees beside Thornbury, feeling for a pulse. Moira Shrike stood frozen a few feet away, a hand pressed to her mouth, her eyes unreadable.

Elara’s training—a three-year stint as a veterinary nurse before opening her bookshop—kicked in. She handed Nutmeg’s lead to a pale Bertie. “Hold her.” She knelt opposite Bea.

“No pulse,” Bea whispered, her face ashen. She began CPR, her movements precise and desperate.

Elara focused on his airway. As she leaned close, turning his head slightly, a faint, elusive scent cut through the cloying rose perfume. It wasn’t floral. It was sharp, acrid, and chillingly familiar from her chemistry classes long ago and a thousand warnings about certain plants.

Bitter almond.

Her gaze snapped to the ‘Midnight Siren’. The bloom Thornbury had inhaled from still quivered slightly. She leaned closer to it, careful not to touch. There, just under the overwhelming rose scent, it was stronger—that same, deadly hint of almond.

“Elara?” Bea panted between compressions.

“Keep going,” Elara said, but her mind was racing. Cyanide. It had to be. It smelled of bitter almonds. It could be absorbed through inhalation if the compound was volatile enough. A prize-winning rose, sprayed or infused with a deadly poison. It was absurd. It was impossible.

It was murder.

The paramedics arrived with brisk efficiency, taking over from a sweating Bea. They worked with focused urgency, but their exchanged glances spoke volumes. By the time they loaded Gerald Thornbury onto a gurney, the festive atmosphere of the garden show had evaporated, replaced by a shocked, sombre dread. The police, in the form of Detective Inspector Singh—a calm, capable woman Elara knew from the occasional book club—arrived and began cordoning off the rose pavilion.

“A heart attack, surely,” someone murmured in the crowd now held back behind tape.

“The stress, he was always so wound up…”

“Poor man. Terrible way to go.”

Elara didn’t contradict them. She stood with Nutmeg pressed against her legs, the corgi unusually quiet and still. As the police began their preliminary work, Elara watched Nutmeg. The dog’s attention was fixed on the ‘Midnight Siren’ pot. Her nose twitched, but she didn’t strain forward. Instead, she let out a low, uneasy whine deep in her throat and shrank back, trying to hide behind Elara’s ankles.

“What is it, Meg?” Elara murmured. “You smell it too, don’t you?”

The dog refused to go any closer.

DI Singh was talking to Horace, to Moira, to a weeping woman who was Thornbury’s secretary. Elara knew she should go over, mention the smell. But a cold trickle of caution held her back. You sound mad, she told herself. A poisoned rose at a village fete? They’ll think you’ve been reading too many of your own mystery novels.*

She decided to wait. To watch.

The body was finally removed, a sombre procession that cast a long shadow over the wilting gladioli. The crowd began to disperse, speaking in hushed tones. The show was effectively over. DI Singh and a forensics officer in a white suit were now focused solely on the anonymous purple rose, carefully bagging the entire plant.

As they shifted the heavy terracotta pot, something small and dark dislodged from beneath its rim and fell onto the grass matting.

Elara’s breath caught.

It was a gardening glove. A single, right-handed glove, coated in a fine, dark loam. It was a premium brand, tough but flexible, with a distinctive green stripe across the knuckles and a reinforced leather palm.

Her brand.

Identical to the well-worn pair sitting on her own potting bench at home.

She took an involuntary step forward before stopping herself. Her heart hammered against her ribs. She looked around furtively. No one else seemed to have seen it; the forensics officer’s back was turned, and DI Singh was making a note on her phone.

The glove lay there, a silent, accusing scrap of fabric. Someone wearing her favourite gloves had handled that pot, that deadly plant, very recently. Someone who had perhaps left it there in a moment of panic or haste.

A puzzle piece, dark and dangerous, had just clicked into place in the sunlit, shattered remains of the day. The hook was set. And Elara Finch, with a confused corgi at her feet and the scent of bitter almonds haunting her memory, felt the first, irresistible tug of the hunt.
