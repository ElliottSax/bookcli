Chapter 4: Roots of Rivalry

Chapter 4: Roots of Rivalry

The Rosehaven Archives were housed in the old stone basement of the town library, a place that smelled of damp paper, lemon oil, and the ghost of a thousand forgotten cups of tea. It was a sanctuary of quiet, broken only by the soft thwip-thwip of a ceiling fan and the contented snuffling of Nutmeg, who had discovered a sunbeam falling across a worn Persian rug.

Elara, however, was surrounded by a tempest of paper. She had maps of Rosehaven from 1890, ledger books from the first Garden Show committee, and a precarious stack of leather-bound town council minutes. Her fingers, stained with ancient dust and modern ink, traced the lines of lineage and land deeds with the focus of a surgeon.

“It’s all about the dirt, Nutmeg,” she murmured, not looking up. The corgi’s ear twitched in acknowledgement. “Not just any dirt. Specifically, the three acres of south-facing, mineral-rich slope behind what is now the community center.”

The connection had come to her in the hazy hour before dawn, while she was repotting a nervous Fittonia and trying not to think of Marigold Prentiss’s ashen face. Both victims, Councilman Alistair Thornbury and Marigold, were avid gardeners, but that was true of half the town. No, it was something in Chief Henderson’s brusque recap: ‘Thornbury, old family. Prentiss, also an old name.’ A casual historian’s instinct had prickled at Elara’s neck.

Now, the proof was whispering from the brittle pages. In 1912, the town founder, Horace Finch (no relation, she noted with a strange mix of pride and relief), had parceled out the land. The prime horticultural plot had been granted jointly to two protégés: Silas Thornbury, a practical plantsman with fists like turnips, and Theodore Finch (a cousin, alas), a dreamy botanist prone to poetic descriptions of pollen. They were to collaborate, to make Rosehaven a beacon of botanical innovation.

“And for a while, they did,” Elara whispered, turning a page with a delicate crackle. Photographs showed two stern men standing beside gargantuan pumpkins and perfect rose standards. Then, in 1923, the entries changed. The Rosehaven Gazette spoke of a “regrettable divergence of vision.” Council minutes alluded to a “dispute over proprietary methods.” By 1925, the partnership was severed by a new road—Thornbury Lane—cut right through the middle of the prized three acres.

The feud had simmered for a century, moving from soil to society. Thornburys became town councilmen, bankers, practical stewards. The local Finch family (Theodore’s line, she clarified mentally) produced artists, teachers, and, in Marigold’s case, a gifted nursery owner with a specialty in rare heirloom blooms. The rivalry was a local legend, played out in petty competition for best hydrangea at the show, but its origin had been obscured by time, reduced to a humorous footnote.

Until now.

Elara’s pen froze over her notebook. She cross-referenced the dates with a modern business registry she’d sweet-talked from the librarian. Her breath hitched. Just six weeks ago, a new LLC had been filed with the state: Thornbury & Finch Hybrids. The principals were Alistair Thornbury and Marigold Prentiss (née Finch).

“A joint patent application,” Elara said aloud, the pieces snapping together with an almost audible click. Nutmeg lifted his head, sensing the change in her energy. “They’d ended the feud. They were going to business together. On what?”

The answer came from the oldest, most fragile book she’d requested: Silas Thornbury’s personal gardening journal. His handwriting was dense and angry, the ink blotted in places as if by force. Most of it was mundane—notes on blight resistance, fertilizer formulas. But in the back, referenced several times with furious underlines, was a single name: ‘The Aurea Rosa.’

A footnote in a 1930s horticultural society bulletin provided the myth. It was a theoretical hybrid, a rose rumored to possess the perfect golden hue of a champagne sunset, with a fragrance described as “honey, apricot, and the memory of rain.” More importantly, the article hinted, its breeding formula—a specific, complex sequence of grafts and crossings—was believed to confer extraordinary hardiness and perpetual bloom. A grail for rose breeders. The secret, the bulletin concluded with a sigh, was lost with the dissolution of the Thornbury-Finch partnership.

Elara sat back, her mind racing. A lost formula worth a fortune. A century-old feud recently mended for a joint venture. Two partners, now dead. And she, Elara Finch, a botanical historian with the precise, obscure knowledge to possibly reconstruct such a formula, had just blown into town.

“Oh, no,” she groaned, pressing her palms to her eyes. “I’m not just a witness. I’m a plausible suspect.”

The thought was still chilling her when the archives door creaked open. A man filled the doorway, not with Chief Henderson’s solid authority, but with a wiry, agitated tension. He was in his sixties, with the leathery skin of someone who spent life outdoors, and the sharp, suspicious eyes of a Thornbury—she’d seen that same flinty gaze in Alistair’s portrait.

“You’re her,” he stated, his voice a gravelly accusation. “The Finch from away.”

Nutmeg was on his feet, a low rumble in his throat. Elara placed a steadying hand on his head. “I’m Elara Finch. And you are?”

“Cyrus Thornbury. Alistair was my cousin.” He stepped into the room, his work boots loud on the stone. “I hear you’ve been digging. Asking questions in the nurseries. Poking around the show grounds. And now you’re here, rooting through our past.”

“I’m trying to understand what happened,” Elara said, keeping her tone even, scholarly. “It’s what I do. I study the history of plants and people.”

“You study how to make plants do wicked things, more like,” Cyrus shot back, jabbing a finger toward her notes. “I know who you are. Wrote that book on toxic flora in Victorian gardens, didn’t you? The Poisoned Petal.” He said the title like a curse. “Fancy yourself an expert on poisons. And now you show up, and the two people who were about to put Rosehaven back on the map for something beautiful end up dead. My cousin, and that Finch woman.” He said ‘Finch’ with a venom that had been cultivated for a hundred years.

“Marigold Prentiss was also a victim,” Elara reminded him coldly.

“A means to an end!” he barked. “Someone didn’t want that partnership. Someone wanted the Aurea Rosa for themselves. And you.” He leaned over the table, his scent of fertilizer and old anger filling the space between them. “You’ve got the knowledge. You’ve got the motive—a Finch, trying to steal the glory for the family name. Where is it?”

“Where is what?”

“The research! Alistair’s notes, Marigold’s specimens. The formula. It’s gone from his study. You were at the Garden Show, sniffing around his rose. You were at her nursery the day before she died, asking about sourcing oleander!”

The accusation hung in the dusty air. Elara felt a genuine thrill of fear. He was constructing a case, and it was terrifyingly coherent.

“I was admiring a prize-winning plant, and I was sourcing oleander for a legitimate, documented study on historical pesticide use,” she said, her voice tighter than she intended. “I have no interest in stealing a formula. I didn’t even know it existed until twenty minutes ago.”

Cyrus straightened, his eyes full of a bitter, inherited triumph. “Tell it to the chief. We’re a small town, Ms. Finch. We look after our own. And we don’t take kindly to outsiders coming in and stirring up our soil, especially when people start dying in it.”

He turned and left, his exit as abrupt and violent as his entrance. The door slammed, shaking the glass in the old cabinets. Nutmeg let out a definitive woof at the closed door, then looked up at Elara, his brow furrowed with canine concern.

“Well,” Elara said, her heart hammering against her ribs. “That was suboptimal.”

She needed air, and she needed to think. The puzzle was now a maze, and she was trapped inside it. Gathering her things with trembling hands, she noticed Nutmeg had wandered over to a low shelf marked “Local Floriculture – Donated Volumes.” He was sniffing intently at the spine of a massive, crumbling tome titled The Compendium of Rosehaven Blooms (1901).

“Not now, Nug. Mummy’s having a crisis.”

But Nutmeg was insistent. He nudged the book with his nose, then looked back at her, whining softly. It was his ‘I-found-a-squirrel-in-the-geraniums’ whine. Sighing, Elara walked over. The book was enormous, bound in faded green cloth. As she pulled it from the shelf, it was suspiciously light for its size. The front cover hinged oddly.

With a careful touch, she opened it. The interior had been hollowed out. A perfect, book-shaped box. Inside the cavity was nothing but a faint, rectangular dust shadow, as if something the size of a small journal or a packet of papers had lain there for decades, until very recently.

It was empty.

“Someone else has been digging,” Elara whispered, a cold certainty settling in her stomach. The hidden compartment was too perfect, too specific. This wasn’t a random theft; it was a surgical extraction. The formula, or the key to it, had been here. And now it was gone.

The sound of heavy footsteps echoed from the library above, moving with purpose. Not the shuffling gait of the librarian, or the scattered steps of a patron. These were deliberate, official.

Elara closed the hollow book, her mind whirring. Cyrus Thornbury’s anger, the empty compartment, her own expertise laid out like a roadmap for suspicion… It was converging, and she was at the epicenter.

She had just slipped the book back onto the shelf when the archives door opened again. This time, it was Chief Henderson. He wasn’t alone. Officer Jenkins stood behind him, looking profoundly uncomfortable. Henderson’s face was a mask of polite, professional regret, which was somehow worse than Cyrus’s open fury.

“Ms. Finch,” the chief said, his voice filling the quiet room. “I’m glad I found you here.”

“Chief Henderson,” Elara replied, forcing a calm she didn’t feel. “Nutmeg and I were just finishing up some historical research.”

“I’m sure.” He held her gaze. “I’m afraid I have a warrant here to search your property. Specifically, your greenhouse and your study.”

The world seemed to narrow to the piece of paper he held. The formal script bled into a meaningless blur.

“On what grounds?” she managed.

“A witness has come forward,” Henderson said, his words measured and heavy. “They state that they saw you, the day before Marigold Prentiss’s death, handling oleander plants at the back of your greenhouse. Pruning them, and placing the clippings into a personal container, not into the toxic waste disposal.”

Elara’s blood ran cold. It was true. She had been pruning her oleander. It was leggy. She’d placed the clippings in a sealed zip-top bag to take to the university’s hazardous botany lab for a colleague. A perfectly innocent, professional act.

But someone had seen her. Someone had noted it. And now, with two poisonings, that simple act was a damning thread.

“I can explain that,” she said, hearing the defensive thinness in her own voice.

“I look forward to hearing it,” Henderson said, not unkindly, but with an immovable finality. “For now, Officer Jenkins will accompany you home. We’ll conduct the search as unobtrusively as possible.”

Unobtrusive. The word echoed hollowly. There was nothing unobtrusive about a police search in a town like Rosehaven. By sundown, everyone would know. The charming, witty botanist from out of town would be the prime suspect in the Poisoned Petal murders.

As she followed Jenkins up the stairs, Nutmeg pressed close to her leg, a warm, worried anchor. Elara looked back once at the archive basement, at the silent shelves holding the town’s dirty, rooted secrets. She had gone digging for the roots of a rivalry. Now, she was caught in them, and the thorns were pointing squarely at her.

The hook was set, and she was the one fighting on the line.
