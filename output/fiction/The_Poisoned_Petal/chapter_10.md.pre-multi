Chapter 10: Midnight in the Moon Garden

The Moon Garden at midnight was a study in monochrome enchantment. Silver light, cold and precise as a scalpel, carved the world into shapes of pewter and ink. It pooled in the chalices of the night-blooming cereus and limned the velvet petals of the midnight phlox, making them glow with an eerie, internal luminescence. The air was thick with their perfume—a cloying, sweet scent that clung to the back of the throat, like candy left to rot. Elara stood at the heart of it, the gravel path crunching softly under her boots, a lone figure in a landscape of sleeping colour.

Nutmeg, a rust-and-white splotch against the grey, pressed against her leg, a low, continuous rumble in his chest. It wasn’t a growl, not yet, but the vibration of a tiny engine set to high alert. In the pocket of her waxed jacket, the digital voice recorder was a hard, cold rectangle. Its red ‘record’ light was hidden by fabric, a tiny mechanical heartbeat. She had sent a two-word text to Chief Henderson an hour ago: Moon Garden. Now. Then she had turned her phone to silent and prayed his suspicious, coffee-stained heart was in the right place.

“Punctual. I appreciate that in a gardener.”

Beatrice’s voice emerged from the shadows near the old marble birdbath, as smooth and cultivated as the soil in her prize-winning borders. She stepped into a patch of moonlight, dressed not in her usual muddy wellingtons and canvas smock, but in a tailored tweed skirt and a crisp blouse. She looked like she was attending a particularly sombre board meeting.

“Beatrice,” Elara said, her own voice surprisingly steady. “You wanted to talk about the formula?”

“Let’s dispense with the charade, dear. We both know there is no missing formula. Not the original, at any rate. A clever ruse. I was impressed.” Beatrice clasped her hands in front of her. “You’ve been a remarkable catalyst. More tenacious than I anticipated. I thought the police’s obvious suspicion would have… cowed you.”

“Why?” The word left Elara’s lips on a plume of frosty breath. “Why frame me? I admired you. I learned from you.”

“And that is precisely why!” Beatrice’s composure cracked for a second, a fissure of raw emotion. “You have a genuine, uncluttered love for the work. You see a plant, not a profit margin. You were perfect. The talented, knowledgeable outsider with a tragically poisonous specialty. The town would have been relieved to find you were the culprit. It’s so much neater that way.”

She began to pace slowly along the edge of the white lamb’s ear, her fingers brushing the fuzzy leaves. “My life, Elara, has been spent in devotion to this earth, to the secrets it yields. Sixty years of study, of breeding, of unlocking potentials these people,” she jerked her head contemptuously toward the sleeping town, “could never comprehend. The founding families—the Vances, the Peabodys, the late, unlamented Mrs. Winthrop—they saw botany as a hobby for spinsters or a means to prettify their wealth. My greenhouse, my research, were just another quaint attraction for the Garden Festival.”

She stopped and fixed Elara with a gaze that was both fervent and chillingly rational. “Gerald Peabody was going to sell the community garden land to a developer. He called my protest ‘sentimental drivel.’ The foxglove digitalis in his brandy was a simple, elegant correction. He died of a ‘heart condition,’ as he always had—a weak one. Agatha Winthrop… she stole my hybrid tea rose, ‘Moonlight Sonata,’ and presented it as her own at the national show. The ricin from her own prized castor bean plants, introduced through a tiny scratch from a specially prepared thorn, was a fitting reclamation. An ‘allergic reaction,’ they said.”

Elara felt the world tilt. The charming accidents, the town tragedies, rearranged themselves in her mind with a sickening click. Each one a meticulous, murderous pruning.

“And Oliver?” Elara whispered, thinking of the gentle beekeeper.

“A necessary casualty,” Beatrice said, with a sigh that sounded almost genuine. “Oliver was becoming too observant. He noticed my increased interest in his monkshood, asked questions about the alkaloid extraction process. His anaphylaxis was, admittedly, a broader stroke than I prefer, but the bee sting provided a flawless canvas. I simply applied a concentrated tincture of aconitine to the latch of his hive. The poor man never stood a chance.”

Nutmeg’s rumble deepened into a true growl. Elara’s hand found the warm fur on his head, anchoring herself. “You painted them. Your illustrations… they’re not just records. They’re trophies.”

A faint, proud smile touched Beatrice’s lips. “They are memorials. Final portraits. Each one captures the essence of the plant that delivered justice. I am an artist, as well as a scientist.”

“This isn’t science, Beatrice. It’s madness.”

“It is weeding!” The word snapped out, sharp and final. “And the garden is almost clean. There is one last, deep-rooted weed to pull. Arthur Vance.”

Elara’s blood ran colder than the night air. “Arthur? He’s a pompous fool, but he’s not evil.”

“He is the rootstock!” Beatrice hissed. “His family bankrolled every piece of exploitation this town is built on. He dismisses everything I’ve built. And he is the final piece of the puzzle. Tonight’s final act.”

From the pocket of her tweed jacket, Beatrice produced a small, professional-looking syringe. In the moonlight, a tiny amount of clear liquid glinted within. “A concentrated neurotoxin derived from Aconitum napellus. My own refinement. Rapid, untraceable at standard autopsy if administered correctly.”

“You’re going to kill Arthur Vance tonight?” Elara’s mind raced, trying to catch up to the horrifying script.

“No, my dear. You are.” Beatrice’s smile was ghastly. “The final scene will play out thus: The troubled, guilty horticulturist Elara Finch, having killed three people, lures Arthur Vance to a remote location—perhaps here, perhaps the old greenhouse—to silence him, as he was getting too close to the truth. A struggle ensues. He overpowers you, injects you with your own poison in a fit of rage, then, horrified at what he’s done, turns the syringe on himself. A murder-suicide. A tragic, conclusive end to the Poisoned Petal murders. The town sleeps soundly, and the last of the greedy old guard is erased.”

The sheer, clean audacity of it stole Elara’s breath. It was a perfect, poisonous bloom of a plan. “And you just… return to your roses?”

“I return to my work. Unburdened.” Beatrice took a step forward, the syringe held lightly, like a pen. “I am sorry it has to be you, Elara. Truly. In another life, you would have made a splendid protégé. But this is the necessary conclusion.”

Nutmeg had heard enough. The corgi, twelve pounds of indignant fury, launched himself forward with a bark that shattered the silent garden. It was not a deep, fearsome sound, but a sharp, percussive yap of pure defiance. He didn’t attack, but danced just before Beatrice’s feet, a noisy, distracting barrier of principle.

Beatrice flinched, startled by the sudden cacophony. “Control your animal!”

“He’s pointing out the flaw in your plan, Beatrice!” Elara said, seizing the moment, her voice rising. “It’s too neat! Henderson isn’t as stupid as you think. He’d question it. And what about my dog? What about my friends? Maggie would never believe I’d do this! You can’t prune away human connection that easily!”

For a flicker, Beatrice’s certainty wavered, her eyes darting from the barking corgi to Elara’s fierce expression. “Sentiment,” she spat. “The weak soil that chokes true progress. It doesn’t matter what they believe. The evidence will be incontrovertible.”

She steadied herself, her gaze hardening into obsidian. She raised the syringe. “Now, we’ll take a little walk to the potting shed. Arthur is already on his way, expecting a clandestine meeting about your ‘discovery.’ The final act awaits.”

Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs. The recorder was capturing everything, but Henderson was nowhere to be seen. The plan was crumbling into simple, brutal survival.

“Stand down, Beatrice. It’s over.”

The voice, gravelly and authoritative, came from the darkness of the yew hedge. Chief Henderson stepped into the moonlight, his face grim, his service weapon held in a two-handed grip, pointed at the ground. Behind him, two uniformed officers materialized like ghosts from the shadows of the pergola.

Relief, warm and dizzying, flooded Elara. He came.

Beatrice froze, her head swiveling toward the new voices. The shock on her face was momentary, quickly calcifying into a terrifying calm. Her eyes locked onto Elara. “You recorded our conversation.”

“I sent him my location,” Elara said, her voice shaking with spent adrenaline. “The recorder is just… insurance.”

“Beatrice Thornbury,” Henderson intoned, taking a cautious step forward. “You are under arrest for the murders of Gerald Peabody, Agatha Winthrop, and Oliver Boone. Put the syringe down on the ground. Slowly.”

The world seemed to hold its breath. The scent of the night flowers was overpowering. Beatrice looked at the chief, at the officers, then back at Elara. A strange, almost serene smile touched her lips.

“You think you’ve won a victory, Chief? You’ve just let the weeds grow back.”

Then she moved.

It wasn’t a lunge toward the police. It was a whirlwind of unexpected motion toward Elara. Years of digging, hauling bags of soil, and pruning stubborn branches had given the older woman a wiry, formidable strength. She knocked Nutmeg aside with a swift, brutal kick of her sensible brogue. The corgi yelped, tumbling into a bed of silvery artemisia.

Elara cried out, stumbling back, but Beatrice’s hand was a vice on her forearm. In a blur, Elara was wrenched around, her back pulled hard against Beatrice’s tweed-clad chest. The cold, hard tip of the syringe pressed against the soft, vulnerable skin just below Elara’s jaw.

“Not another step!” Beatrice’s voice, once cultured and calm, was now a wire pulled taut, vibrating with lethal intensity. Her breath was hot and quick against Elara’s ear. The cloying floral scent of the garden mixed with the faint, clean smell of lavender soap on Beatrice’s skin—a horrifically domestic detail.

Henderson and the officers froze. “Beatrice, don’t do this!” Henderson barked. “It’s finished!”

“It is not!” she screamed, the sound raw and shocking in the serene garden. The syringe pressed harder. Elara felt a pinpoint of pain, a promise of the oblivion within the glass barrel. She could see Henderson’s face, pale in the moonlight, his professional detachment shattered into sheer panic. She could see Nutmeg, struggling to his feet, whimpering. The world narrowed to the cold at her throat and the frantic drum of her own pulse against it.

“This was to be a masterpiece,” Beatrice whispered, her voice cracking with a terrible, wounded pride. “A perfect, closed system. And you… you with your messy heart and your noisy dog… you’ve made a mess of it.”

Elara held perfectly still, every muscle screaming. She could feel the tremor in Beatrice’s arm, the fine line between control and collapse. The Moon Garden’s beauty was now a cruel joke, a silver-lit stage for a brutally intimate ending. The puzzle was solved, the killer revealed, but the final, deadly piece was now pressed to her neck, and Chief Henderson’s horrified eyes told her he had no clear move to make.

The masterpiece, it seemed, would end with a final, bloody stroke after all.
