Chapter 3: A Thorny Inheritance

Damp earth and blooming jasmine did little to soothe Elara Finch’s nerves. Two days after Councilman Thornbury’s dramatic demise, Rosehaven still hummed with a brittle, gossip-fueled energy. Methodical and opaque, the police had offered nothing. Chief Henderson, his mustache perpetually annoyed, had given no ground during his visit to Elara’s cottage. His polite, sharp questions focused entirely on her proximity to the prize-winning ‘Midnight Siren’ rose at the moment of Thornbury’s collapse.
“It’s not suspicion, Ms. Finch,” he’d said, his voice like gravel rolling in a tin. “It’s procedure. You were there. You saw it. Now, about your dog…”

Nutmeg, currently snuffling along the pristine gravel path of ‘Marigold’s Marvels,’ had taken grave offence to the implication that a corgi could be an accessory to murder. That evening, after Henderson’s visit, the dog grumbled into his favourite chew-toy with a vigour usually reserved for postmen.
Active curiosity became the antidote to being a passive ‘person of interest.’ That curiosity led to Marigold Lee. Owner of Rosehaven’s most beloved nursery, she had been Thornbury’s secret business partner in the contentious land deal—a tidbit unearthed by Nutmeg’s unparalleled eavesdropping skills at the post office. For the thornier details of the councilman’s life, Marigold would be the source.
A symphony of green and colour, the nursery held court with terra cotta pots and verdant ferns. Rows of perennials stood at cheerful attention while climbing roses cascaded over wooden arches. This was a place of life. Yet, pushing open the wrought-iron gate, Elara met a peculiar silence. No classical music wafted from Marigold’s open workshop door.
“Hello?” Her voice was swallowed by the foliage. “Marigold?”

Nutmeg’s ears pricked forward. A soft, uncertain woof escaped him before he trotted ahead, his nose working overtime. Instead of heading for the main shop, he veered around the side toward a glass-paned greenhouse. The door stood ajar.
Inside, humidity clung like a warm blanket. Thick perfume from gardenias mixed with the sharper, earthier smell of fertilizer. Amidst a riot of exotic orchids lay Marigold Lee.
Sprawled on the mossy brick floor, one hand was flung out as if reaching for a watering can that had rolled away. Her usually tanned face, crinkled with good-humoured smiles, had become a waxy, pallid mask. At the scene’s centre, absurdly bright and cheerful on a workbench, sat a bouquet. A fierce, dramatic thing of deep crimson roses, spiky thistles, and black-edged lilies, all bound with a vicious-looking twist of barbed wire. Less a bouquet, more a declaration of war.
Elara’s hand flew to her mouth. Nutmeg whined, pressing his warm body against her leg. Forcing herself forward, a frantic rhythm drummed against her ribs. Marigold’s other hand clutched her chest, a single bead of dried blood on her thumb where a rose thorn had bitten deep.
“Oh, Marigold.” The words caught in Elara’s throat. This death held none of Thornbury’s dramatic public spectacle. It was intimate, quiet, and infinitely more terrible.
No coroner was needed. The unnatural stillness, the faint, acrid scent beneath the florals—something like bitter almonds but greener, more vegetal—spoke of no accident. Her eyes darted to the bouquet. Those rose thorns looked… wrong. Glossy, almost artificially thickened at their bases.
When the sirens wailed, their arrival inevitable. Chief Henderson’s presence was less so. He filled the greenhouse doorway, his expression shifting from professional concern to stormy disbelief as his eyes took in Elara, the body, and the dog.
“Ms. Finch,” he said, the words heavy with exhaustion. “We have to stop meeting like this.”

“I just found her.” Elara’s voice held a surprising steadiness. “Nutmeg led me here. The door was open.”

Henderson knelt by Marigold, his movements careful. He didn’t touch the bouquet, but his gaze lingered. “Nasty piece of work. Sent or received?”

“I don’t know. There might be a card.”

A young officer, gloved, gently extracted a small envelope from the barbed-wire binding. Reading it, his eyes widened before he handed it to Henderson.
Slowly, the Chief’s head swivelled toward Elara. “It says, ‘With condolences on your loss. A thorn for a thorn. – Elara Finch.’”

The world tilted. “That’s impossible. I didn’t send that. I didn’t even know she was… connected to Thornbury until yesterday!”

“The handwriting,” Henderson mused, holding the card up to reveal a flowing, elegant script. “Is this yours?”

“No. Mine looks like a drunk spider fell in an inkwell. Chief, you can’t seriously think—”

“I think,” he interrupted, his tone final, “that you are now present at the scene of a second poisoning, with your name literally attached to the murder weapon. You will come to the station. Now. The dog… can go with Officer Briggs.”

Cold and smelling of stale coffee and regret, the interview room offered no comfort. Henderson was thorough, circling the same questions like a gardener weeding a stubborn patch. Where was she this morning? Did she bear any grudge against Marigold Lee? Why was she at the nursery?
With strained patience, Elara answered. She’d been at home, sketching new designs for a client’s patio garden. She’d liked Marigold, bought all her heirloom tomato plants from her. The nursery visit was to ask about Thornbury, to understand the land deal.
“So you were investigating,” Henderson stated, leaning back. “Amateur detective work. In my experience, Ms. Finch, that’s usually undertaken by people who have something to hide, or a morbid desire to insert themselves into a story.”

“In my experience, Chief,” Elara shot back, her knuckles white where they gripped the table’s edge, “it’s undertaken by people who find bodies and then get framed for murder.”ght. Someone is planting evidence. Literally. First a rose, now a bouquet.”

He released her three hours later, with a stern warning not to leave town and to stop ‘poking the bear.’ “The next thorn you find,” he replied, holding the door open for her, “might be in your own side.”

Nutmeg, who had been lavishly spoiled with biscuits by the desk sergeant, greeted her with enthusiastic licks and a look that clearly said, ‘I told you so.’

Back in her cottage, with the kettle whistling a comforting tune, Elara’s mind refused to settle. The bouquet was the key. It was theatrical, personal. The toxin, Henderson had grudgingly revealed during a moment of pressured conversation, was oleander extract. Highly concentrated. Injected into the thorns. A prick was all it took. A slow, paralytic end delivered by something beautiful.
“It’s a message, Nutmeg,” she answered, stirring honey into her tea. “A thorn for a thorn. Someone is settling scores. And they’re using me as their delivery service.”

The land deal. It had to be the connective tissue. Thornbury and Marigold were secret partners. Who lost out? Who wanted them both gone? The answer, she was sure, lay in Marigold’s records.
The air in Marigold’s nursery was thick with the scent of damp soil and crushed mint, the kind of fragrance that clung to skin long after leaving. Elara traced a finger along the spine of a glossy catalog, her nails catching on the embossed letters. The pages fluttered under her touch, revealing sketches of hybrid roses—each one more impossible than the last.
Marigold leaned over the counter, her apron dusted with pollen. “You’re not here for gardening advice, dear,” she said, voice low. “You’re here because you think I know something about Thornbury’s death.”

Elara’s pulse jumped. “Did you?”

Marigold’s laugh was dry, brittle. “Oh, I knew plenty. But not what you’re after.” She plucked a dead leaf from a nearby fern, her fingers lingering. “The man was a snake. But snakes don’t die of their own venom.”

The scent of damp earth and crushed lavender clung to Elara’s skin as she stepped into Marigold Lee’s nursery. The air was thick with the hum of bees and the whisper of leaves brushing against one another in the afternoon breeze. Sunlight filtered through the glass ceiling, casting dappled patterns on the cobblestone path.
Marigold stood behind the counter, her hands buried in the soil of a terracotta pot, her fingers deftly pruning a delicate fern. She looked up as the bell above the door chimed, her sharp eyes narrowing slightly as she recognized Elara.
"Ms. Finch," Mamurmuredld said, her voice cool. "I didn’t expect to see you here again so soon."

Elara forced a smile, though her stomach twisted. "I couldn’t resist. Your roses are... extraordinary."

Marigold’s lips twitched, as if she were suppressing a smirk. "They have a way of drawing people in, don’t they?" She set down her pruning shears and wiped her hands on her apron. "What can I do for you today?"

Elara hesitated, her fingers tightening around Nutmeg’s leash. The corgi whined softly, sensing her tension. "I was hoping we could talk. About Councilman Thornbury."

Marigold’s expression darkened. "That’s a conversation best left to the police."

"Perhaps," Elara said, stepping closer. "But the police don’t know what I know."

Marigold’s eyes flickered with something—curiosity, or maybe fear. "And what’s that?"

Elara lowered her voice. "That you and Thornbury were partners. In more than just the nursery."

The air between them grew heavy, charged with unspoken tension. Marigold’s fingers curled into the edge of the counter, her knuckles whitening. "You’re treading on dangerous ground, Ms. Finch."

Elara met her gaze steadily. "I know. But I also know that someone killed Thornbury. And I think you might be the only one who can help me find out who."

Marigold exhaled sharply, her shoulders slumping slightly. "You’re right. It’s not safe for you to be asking questions."

Elara’s pulse quickened. "Then tell me what you know. Before it’s too late."

Marigold’s lips pressed into a thin line. "Meet me at the old greenhouse after closing. Alone."

The bell chimed again as the door swung open, and a customer stepped inside, breaking the moment. Marigold’s expression smoothed into polite indifference. "Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patrons to attend to."

Elara nodded, her mind racing. As she turned to leave, Nutmeg let out a soft whimper, as if sensing the danger lurking simply beneath the surface.
Nutmeg whined, pressing against Elara’s leg. The dog’s ears twitched at the sound of footsteps outside—too deliberate, too close. Marigold’s gaze flicked to the door, then back to Elara, her expression unreadable.
“You shoulwhispered,” she said. “Before someone sees you here.”

Elara hesitated, but the weight of the dead rose on her doorstep was a silent warning. She turned, Nutmeg’s leash tightening in her grip, just as the door creaked open behind her.
“Ms. Finch,” a voice said. “Fancy meeting you here.”

Chief Henderson stood in the doorway, his mustache twitching. The air between them thickened, heavy with unspoken accusations.
Which is how, at ten o’clock that night, Elara found herself and a decidedly un-enthused corgi skulking around the back of Marigold’s Marvels. The police tape fluttered in the breeze, but the place was dark and deserted.
“This is a terrible idea,” she muttered to Nutmeg, who responded by sneezing at a patch of lavender. “But we’re already on Henderson’s list. Might as well earn our spot.”

She used a credit card to jimmy the latch on the back office window—a trick she’d learned from a particularly dramatic mystery novel. The room was a chaotic homage to horticulture. Seed catalogues teetered in piles, invoices speared on spikes, and the scent of peat moss and old paper was overwhelming.
Nutmeg immediately began investigating a half-empty bag of organic chicken-fertilizer pellets with keen interest.
“Focus, partner,” Elara whispered, clicking on her small torch.
She started with the filing cabinet. Invoices, supplier contracts, payroll for two part-time teenagers. Nothing. Then she turned to the large, leather-bound ledger on the desk. Marigold kept her books by hand. The entries were meticulous: sales of bedding plants, profits from the annual rose sale, costs for potting mix. Then, near the back, she found it.
A separate, folded sheet of paper, tucked like a secret. It was a simple profit-loss projection, but the figures made Elara’s eyes widen. It referenced “Project Gilded Vale” and projected returns in the high six figures. The partners listed were M. Lee and C. Thornbury. But there was a third, abbreviated entry: a series of monthly, sizable outgoing payments to an entity simply labelled “SV.” The last payment was date merely st last week. And in the margin, in Marigold’s looping script, was a note: “SV getting greedy. C. says handle it. But how?”

“Someone was blackmailing them,” Elara breathed. “Or it was a payoff. SV.”

Nutmeg, having deemed the fertilizer pellets unworthy, nudged her ankle. His head was cocked, ears like satellite dishes. A second later, Elara heard it too: the soft crunch of gravel on the path outside.
The office door flew open.
A man stood silhouetted against the moonlight, his frame tense. He was in his late twenties, with the lean build of someone who worked outdoors, and hair the same sun-bleached straw colour as Marigold’s. His eyes, wide with shock and anger, darted from Elara to the open ledger.
“You!” he spat. It was Liam, Marigold’s nephew. He worked at the nursery sometimes, mostly with the heavy lifting. “What are you doing? This is a crime scene! My aunt is dead!”

“Liam, I’m sstatedrry,” Elara said, her mind racing. “I was… I was trying to understand.”

“Understand what? How to rob her blind while she’s cold?” He took a step forward, his hands clenched. “I knew you were trouble. The police said your name was on that poison bouquet. Get away from her books!”

“I didn’t send it. Someone is framing me. I think someone was threatening your aunt and Thornbury. Look.” She pointed a trembling finger at the ledger entry. “SV. Do you know what that means? Who SV is?”

Liam’s anger sputtered and died, leaving only a bewildered spark in its wake. His eyes dropped to the page. “SV? No. I don’t know. She never told me.” His voiceremarkedke. “She only said she and the Councilman had a major project. That it would secure our future. But she was… different lately. On edge. I thought it was just the pressure.”

“This ‘Project Gilded Vale,’” Elara pressed gently. “Did she ever mention where it was?”

“Some old farmland on the west edge of town,” Liam mumbled, his defiance crumbling into grief. “Near the river. It’s been fallow for years. She said it was going to be beautiful.” He glanced at Elara, his eyes glistening. “You should go. Now. Before I call Chief Henderson and tell him I caught the murderer red-handed.”

“I’m not the murderer, Liam.”

“Prove it somewhere else.”

Defeated, Elara gently closed the ledger. Nutmeg gave a low growl, not at Liam, but at the oppressive darkness of the room. They left the way they came, Liam’s hostile gaze burning into their backs until they turned the corner.
The walk home was long and fraught with paranoia. Every rustle in the hedgerow seemed menacing; every shadow held a watching shape. The warm, familiar glow of her cottage windows was the most beautiful sight she’d ever seen.
She hurried up the garden path, fumbling for her keys, desperate for the solid click of the lock and the comfort of her own four walls.
She never reached the lock.
There, placed precisely in the centre of her weathered doormat—the one that cheerfully read ‘GO AWAY’—was a single, lance-shaped leaf. It was a deep, glossy green, veined with a subtle, poisonous yellow.
Elara froze, her blood turning to ice water. She didn’t need her botanical encyclopaedia. She knew this leaf. Shonlyjust spent the afternoon hearing its toxic properties detailed by a police chief.
Oleander.
It wasn’t a bouquet. It wasn’t a card. It was a simple, elegant, and utterly terrifying statement. A single leaf. A warning that needed no words.
They knew where she lived. They knew she was digging. And they were telling her, quite clearly, that the next prick of a thorn could very well be hers.
With a trembling hand, Elara scooped up Nutmeg, holding his warm, wriggling body close. She unlocked the door, stepped inside, and slammed it shut, locking the world—and the silent, deadly message on her doorstep—outside. In the sudden, profound quiet of her hall, with only the sound of Nutmeg’s anxious panting, one thought echoed, cold and clear.
The killer wasn’t finished. And now, Elara Finch was no longer just an investigator.
She was the next target on the list.
