Chapter 12: A Clean Bed for Nutmeg

Chapter 12: A Clean Bed for Nutmeg

The morning after the world righted itself on its axis, Elara woke to the sound of rain. It was a gentle, forgiving rain, the kind that washes dust from leaves and soothes parched earth, not the vengeful downpour of the previous weeks. Sunlight, thin and tentative, filtered through the droplets clinging to her bedroom window. For a long moment, she simply lay there, listening to the rhythm of it, feeling the strange, spacious quiet in her chest where a knot of dread had resided for so long.

Nutmeg, sensing her wakefulness, padded from his basket—newly fluffed and laundered—and placed his chin on the edge of the mattress with a soft whump. His eyes, the colour of dark sherry, were wide and clear.

“No nightmares,” Elara said to him, her voice raspy with sleep. “For either of us, I trust.”

The terrier’s tail thumped once against the floorboards. It was agreement enough.

The cleanup of the physical mess at the greenhouse had begun the night before, orchestrated by a mortified and fiercely energetic Arthur Vance. He’d arrived with a small army of discreet, efficient people who’d swept away the shattered glass, righted the toppled benches, and carted off the contaminated soil before the moon had reached its zenith. The structural repairs would take longer, but a temporary wall of clear polythene now kept the weather at bay, billowing softly like a ship’s sail. The air inside, when Elara ventured in wrapped in her favourite cable-knit cardigan, smelled of damp earth, fresh-cut timber, and the clean, cold scent of rain. It no longer smelled of fear.

Her first visitor arrived just after ten, his official car pulling up with a gravitas that made Mrs. Pembroke from across the lane peer from behind her lace curtains. Chief Henderson emerged, not in his usual brusque stride, but with a measured pace. He carried a brown paper bag in one hand and his dignity, somewhat dented, in the other.

“Miss Finch,” he said, standing at her newly repaired garden gate as if awaiting permission.

“Chief. You’re out early. Or is this a social call? The scones are still in the oven, I’m afraid.”

A faint smile touched his lips. “I brought my own.” He lifted the bag. “Two cinnamon buns from The Steaming Leaf. I hear they’re the best antidote to a trying week.”

She ushered him into the kitchen, where the kettle was already singing. They sat at the scrubbed pine table, the pastries between them on a blue-and-white plate. Nutmeg stationed himself equidistant, a silent, hopeful arbitrator.

“I owe you an apology,” Henderson began, after a long sip of tea. “A substantial one. I was… overly focused on the neatness of the puzzle. You were the most convenient piece, and I hammered you into a space you didn’t fit. It blinded me to the subtler picture.”

Elara stirred a spoonful of heather honey into her cup. “You were doing your job, Chief. The evidence was… cultivated, I’ll give you that. Beatrice was an artist in more ways than one.”

“That’s generous of you to say. But insufficient.” He set his cup down with a decisive click. “This town needs eyes that see differently. Mine are good for traffic violations and the occasional barney at The Grizzled Stag. But this… this was a different kind of poison. I’d like to offer you a role. Informal. Consultant. Something like ‘Botanical and Community Liaison.’ The pay is terrible, mostly in baked goods and my enduring gratitude.”

Elara laughed, a real, unburdened sound that surprised even her. “A fancy title for ‘the lady who knows her foxglove from her fiddlehead.’ I accept. On one condition.”

“Name it.”

“Next time you suspect me of murder, you ask for a cup of tea first. It’s only civil.”

“Deal,” he said, and for the first time, his shoulders relaxed.

He left just as the postman arrived, bearing a thick, cream-coloured envelope. It was from the solicitors handling Beatrice’s estate. With it was a smaller, sealed package, addressed in Beatrice’s own elegant, now-chilling script. Elara opened the letter first. It was a list of bequests. Beatrice, it seemed, had been meticulous to the end. Her estate, sizable from years of shrewd plant breeding and illustration sales, was divided. A trust for the upkeep of the historic glasshouses. A scholarship for female botanical artists. And to Elara, “in recognition of a worthy adversary and the only person in this town who truly saw my work,” she left her entire collection of reference texts and her personal journals.

The package contained a single key on a faded velvet ribbon. Attached was a note: ‘For the east wall, behind the Aconitum napellus study. The truth, like the Daphne mezereum, has a bitter bark but enduring seeds. Use them better than I did.’

Elara drove to Beatrice’s studio, the key cold in her hand. The police tape was gone. The space felt hollow, the beautiful light now just light, illuminating empty surfaces. She went to the east wall, to the stunning, deadly illustration of Monkshood. With a gentle push, the framed panel swung inward on silent hinges, revealing a small, deep safe.

The formula was inside. Not on a flash drive or a sheaf of modern paper, but inscribed in a leather-bound notebook, the pages filled with Beatrice’s precise notations and elegant chemical diagrams. It was a work of art in itself. Tucked beside it was a shorter, more recent letter.

‘It is, as they say, a devilishly clever bit of chemistry. A selective herbicide that could have fed millions. But I saw only its power to destroy. I could not bear for it to be used as a cudgel by men like Vance, nor could I destroy a thing of such beauty. So I hid it. Perhaps you, with your irritating penchant for life, will know what to do.’

Elara closed the safe, the notebook held to her chest. She knew exactly what to do.

The Willow Creek Garden Show, usually a riot of competitive dahlias and smug roses, was reborn under a washed-blue sky the following Saturday. The banner that fluttered over the village green now read: ‘The Lila & Thomas Finch Memorial Community Garden Fête.’ Lila, the first victim, who had loved sweet peas. Thomas, the postman, who had always carried a spare biscuit for dogs. Their names, and the others, were etched on a simple stone birdbath placed at the centre of the green, a place for life to gather and drink.

The competitive edge was gone. In its place were stalls where old men shared cuttings of their prize heritage tomatoes with young families, where teenagers helped children pot up sunflowers, and where Elara, at a stall labelled “Finch’s Folly & Friends,” gave away seedlings of bee-friendly lavender and lemon balm.

Arthur Vance, looking ten years younger without the weight of guilt and greed on his shoulders, manned the tea urn, pouring with a steady hand. He caught Elara’s eye and gave a small, solemn nod. His very public apology had been printed in the Willow Creek Chronicle, but his restitution was quieter, more profound. The following week, plans would be announced for the ‘Elara Finch Wing’ at the local library, dedicated to botanical sciences and community horticulture, funded entirely by the Vance family trust.

“Never thought I’d see the day,” murmured a voice beside her. Marjorie from the library stood holding a pot of chives. “Arthur Vance serving tea and naming things after people who aren’t himself. It’s almost enough to make one believe in redemption.”

“Redemption is a perennial, Marjorie,” Elara said, handing a seedling to a little girl. “It needs constant tending, but it can bloom.”

The high point of the fête, for Elara at least, was the afternoon tea she hosted the next day. Not in her pristine cottage, but in the greenhouse. The polythene wall glowed with afternoon light, turning the space into a warm, green-gold lantern. The benches were cleared of plants and covered with mismatched linen cloths. On them sat platters of crustless sandwiches, Marjorie’s famous lemon drizzle cake, scones with jam and clotted cream, and a towering Victoria sponge contributed, to everyone’s astonishment, by Chief Henderson (“My grandmother’s recipe. Don’t make a fuss.”).

Her true friends were there. Marjorie, of course. Old Mr. Henderson from the allotments, his hands like gnarled roots but steady as he held his china cup. Sally and Ben from The Steaming Leaf, who had kept the gossip at bay with fierce loyalty. A few others whose kindness had been a quiet constant. And Nutmeg, who had been brushed to a coppery sheen and wore a new green collar, behaving with impeccable decorum as he circulated, accepting the occasional discreet piece of cucumber sandwich.

“To new growth,” Elara said, raising her cup of Earl Grey.

“To clean beds,” added Marjorie, winking at Nutmeg, who thumped his tail in agreement.

The conversation was light, woven through with the ordinary, precious threads of community: the prognosis for the apple harvest, the vicar’s dreadful new haircut, the mysterious appearance of a particularly handsome tabby cat on Fisher’s Lane. The dark poison of the past weeks was being diluted, drop by drop, by the sheer, relentless normality of life carrying on.

As dusk began to paint the sky in watercolour shades of peach and lavender, the last guest departed with a hug and a leftover scone. Elara and Nutmeg were left in the tranquil mess of crumbs and empty cups. She felt a profound, weary contentment. She began to tidy, the clink of china a peaceful sound. The plants, her rescued, ragged survivors, seemed to lean into the gentle twilight, breathing deeply.

On impulse, she took Nutmeg for a final turn around the cottage garden. The air was cool and sweet with the scent of damp grass and night-scented stock. Fireflies winked over the herb patch. It was a scene of perfect, hard-won peace.

Then, as she passed the sheltered corner where she kept her most delicate specimens—the ones she’d nurtured back from the brink—a spot of unexpected colour caught her eye. It was on the Daphne odora, a plant that had sulked since she’d inherited it, refusing to bloom. She’d almost given up on it. But there, nestled among its glossy, dark leaves, was a single, fat, ruby-red bud. It was unlike any bloom the plant should produce. The shape was wrong, the colour too deep, the promise of it too potent.

Elara knelt, Nutmeg snuffling beside her. She didn’t touch it. She simply observed, her botanist’s mind automatically cataloguing the anomalies: the veining on the sepals, the unusual waxy sheen. A week ago, the sight would have sent a jolt of alarm through her. An unknown plant? A mysterious bud? It would have been a symbol of threat, of hidden poison.

Now, she felt no dread. Only a spark of pure, undiluted curiosity. It was not a warning, but an invitation. A little puzzle from the earth, waiting to unfold.

She smiled, reaching down to scratch behind Nutmeg’s ears. “Well, now,” she whispered to the terrier and the sleeping garden. “What do you suppose you* are?”

The bud, in the gathering dusk, kept its secret. And Elara Finch, consultant botanical liaison, was content to wait and see.
