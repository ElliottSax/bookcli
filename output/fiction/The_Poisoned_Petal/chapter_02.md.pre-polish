Chapter 2: The Scent of Almonds

Chapter 2: The Scent of Almonds

The rain began just after dawn, a soft, persistent patter on the slate roof of Finch & Foliage. It was the kind of rain that smelled of wet earth and promised to make every petal in Rosehaven gleam, but to Elara, it felt like a shroud. The news had travelled through the town’s gossip vines faster than blight. Councilman Alistair Thornbury was dead. Not from natural causes, but from something far more sinister.

Elara sat at her worn pine kitchen table, a steaming mug of Earl Grey cradled between her hands, trying to warm a chill that had settled deep in her bones. Nutmeg, sensing her mood, lay with a soft whump across her feet, a warm, furry anchor. The memory of yesterday was a series of stark snapshots: the shocking vermilion of ‘Crimson King’, Thornbury’s face purpling, the terrible, muffled silence that followed his collapse.

The official confirmation came via a phone call from Beatrice Wainwright, whose niece worked as a dispatcher at the police station.

“Cyanide, darling,” Beatrice said, her voice a hushed, thrilled whisper down the line. “The coroner said it had the distinct scent of bitter almonds about it. Can you imagine? Right there in the marquee!”

Elara could imagine. All too well. She thanked Beatrice and hung up, her mind already racing through the labyrinth of botanical knowledge she’d accumulated over a lifetime. Cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide, to be precise. Volatile. Fast-acting. And yes, it could be found in nature. The pits of stone fruits, wild cherry leaves, and… certain members of the Rosaceae family.

“Oh, no,” she murmured to the quiet kitchen.

Leaving Nutmeg with a distracted ear scratch, she ascended the narrow stairs to her study, a room that was less an office and more a temple to horticulture. Books spilled from shelves, piled on the floor, bookmarked with seed packets and trowels. She bypassed the modern textbooks and went straight for the older, more esoteric volumes: The Poison Garden by Abner Leigh, Flora Toxica Britannica, a handwritten journal from her great-grandfather, a noted plantsman with a morbid curiosity.

It was in his spidery script that she found the reference. “Prunus laurocerasus, the common cherry laurel, contains within its leaves and seeds prunasin, a cyanogenic glycoside. When crushed or macerated, particularly with the enzyme emulsin present, hydrogen cyanide may be liberated. The fragrance is notably almond-like. A dangerous beauty.”

But cherry laurel wasn’t a rose. She kept searching, her fingers leaving trails in the fine dust on the older covers. Finally, in a crumbling Victorian monograph on rose cultivation, she saw it. A footnote, almost an afterthought. “Certain cultivars, particularly those with Rosa foetida in their lineage, have been anecdotally noted to produce trace cyanogenic compounds in their glands, especially under stress or specific grafting conditions. The ‘Austrian Copper’ briar is a noted example. The risk to humans is considered negligible under ordinary circumstances.”

Negligible. Unless, Elara thought, her heart thudding dully, someone knew how to concentrate it. To weaponize a flower’s hidden chemistry. ‘Crimson King’ was a modern hybrid tea, its lineage a trade secret. But what if its breeding had accidentally—or deliberately—amplified that ancient, toxic potential?

Her thoughts were interrupted by the jangle of the shop bell downstairs. She hurried down to find Chief Walter Henderson standing just inside the door, dripping onto her welcome mat. He was a tall, rectangular man who looked perpetually braced against a strong wind, his hair a neat, steel-grey brush and his moustache meticulously trimmed. He held his hat in his hands.

“Miss Finch.”

“Chief Henderson. Can I offer you some tea? You’re damp.”

“No, thank you. I’m here on official business.” His voice was polite but devoid of warmth, a by-the-book recital. “I understand you were present at the Garden Show yesterday and witnessed Mr. Thornbury’s… incident.”

“I was. It was dreadful.”

“We’re speaking to all attendees. Could you walk me through what you saw? From your arrival.”

Elara did, keeping her account precise. She described the crowd, the judging, Thornbury’s grand entrance. She mentioned the anonymous entry card.

Henderson’s pen paused. “Anonymous? The show rules allow that?”

“For the ‘Mystery Bloom’ category, yes. It’s a bit of fun. To focus on the flower, not the gardener.”

“I see.” He wrote the word ‘anonymous’ with a firm underline. “And your interaction with Mr. Thornbury prior to the event?”

Elara felt a prickle of unease. “Interaction? We exchanged pleasantries, I believe. It was a busy day.”

“I’m referring to the town council meeting last month. Regarding the proposed sale of the old Miller meadow for development. The minutes show you were quite vocal in your opposition. Mr. Thornbury was the motion’s chief proponent. The debate was, I’m told, heated.”

There it was. The public feud, laid out like evidence on a table. Elara kept her voice even. “The meadow is the last sizable habitat for native wildflowers and pollinators in the district. I argued for its preservation. He argued for revenue and housing. It was a disagreement of principle, Chief, not a personal vendetta.”

“Of course.” He didn’t sound convinced. “And your expertise extends to rose cultivation?”

“My expertise extends to most plants. Roses are a specialty. I’ve helped several locals with their blight problems.”

“Including the cultivation of rare or… unusual varieties?”

The question hung in the air, heavy with implication. Elara met his gaze. “I appreciate beauty in all its forms, Chief. But I’ve never cultivated a rose meant to harm.”

He held her look for a moment longer than was comfortable, then snapped his notebook shut. “Thank you for your time, Miss Finch. We may have further questions.”

After he left, the shop felt colder. Elara tried to lose herself in the mundane tasks of watering and inventory, but her mind was a whirlwind. The anonymous rose. Who had grown it? The poison had to have been on the bloom, or in it—a delicate, deadly coating activated by the warmth and moisture of a breath. It was a fiendishly clever method. Who in Rosehaven had that knowledge?

The rain eased to a drizzle by mid-afternoon. Driven by a restless need to do something, Elara clipped a lead onto Nutmeg. “Walkies, Meg. Let’s clear our heads.”

They took the long route, past the shuttered showgrounds. The marquee was gone, leaving only trampled grass and a lingering sense of violation. Police tape fluttered, a bright yellow scar around the now-empty podium area. Nutmeg, snuffling with professional corgi diligence, strained at her lead, her nose working overtime on the cocktail of new scents.

“This way, Meg,” Elara said, tugging her gently away from the cordoned zone.

But Nutmeg had other ideas. With a determined snort, she plunged her head into a thick clump of damp lady’s mantle at the edge of the path, her stumpy rear end wiggling with fervor. Before Elara could react, the dog emerged, something small and glinting in her mouth.

“Drop it, Nutmeg! Leave!”

Nutmeg, proud of her treasure, trotted a few paces away and set it down for inspection. It was a small glass vial, no bigger than Elara’s thumb, the kind used for perfume samples or essential oils. It was broken, the neck sheared off cleanly. Without thinking, Elara swooped in and picked it up before Nutmeg could decide it was a chew toy.

It was cool and light in her palm. She held it up, and a faint, ghostly scent—buried under the smells of mud and dog—caught in her nostrils. Not roses. Not earth. A dry, dusty, almost cherry-like aroma. It was faint, but unmistakable once you knew what to look for. It was the scent you got when you crushed a handful of cherry laurel leaves.

Her blood ran cold. This was it. The delivery system. The poison hadn’t been grown in the rose; it had been applied to it.

“Good girl, Meg,” she whispered, her voice tight. “Very clever girl.”

She fished a clean tissue from her pocket and carefully wrapped the vial, her heart hammering against her ribs. She was about to slip it into her coat pocket when a voice called out.

“Miss Finch! Everything alright?”

It was Percy, the show’s head judge, looking pale and worried, hurrying down the path with an umbrella.

Startled, Elara fumbled the tissue-wrapped bundle. “Percy! Yes, fine. Nutmeg just found… a bit of rubbish.”

“Awful business, just awful,” Percy said, shaking his head. “The police have been at me all morning. That rose… such a beauty. Did you know it was entered anonymously? No paperwork, nothing. Just appeared on the table. I thought it was a bit of romantic mystery, but now…” He trailed off, his eyes wide behind his spectacles.

“Did you get a look at who brought it in? Anyone hanging around the entry table?”

“It was chaos, Elara. Volunteers, visitors, exhibitors rushing in at the last minute. It could have been anyone.” He leaned in, lowering his voice. “Chief Henderson was asking about you. About the meadow dispute. I told him it was just politics, but he had that look, you know?”

Elara felt a knot tighten in her stomach. “I know. Thank you, Percy.”

She walked home quickly, the wrapped vial now a burning weight in her pocket. She would call Henderson first thing in the morning. This was evidence. It could lead to the killer.

The rest of the day passed in a blur of nervous tension. She placed the vial, still in its tissue, in a small cardboard box on her desk, intending to deal with it after she’d fed herself and Nutmeg. The phone rang twice—more concerned neighbours seeking gossip—and by the time she’d finished a supper she barely tasted, she’d forgotten the grimy little object, her mind churning with theories instead.

The knock on her door at eight o’clock was firm and authoritative.

Chief Henderson stood on her step again, but this time he wasn’t alone. A younger officer, looking solemn, stood slightly behind him. Henderson’s demeanour had shifted. The polite neutrality was gone, replaced by a granite-like formality.

“Miss Finch. We need to ask you a few more questions. May we come in?”

“Of course.” She led them to the sitting room, Nutmeg regarding the officers with deep suspicion.

Henderson didn’t sit. “We’ve been processing the scene. Our forensics team found several partial prints on the stem holder of the ‘Crimson King’ rose.”

Elara’s breath caught. “That’s good, isn’t it?”

“One set is a match for the late Mr. Thornbury,” Henderson continued, his eyes fixed on her. “The other is a partial, but clear enough for identification.” He paused, letting the silence swell. “They’re yours, Miss Finch.”

The room tilted slightly. “Mine? That’s impossible. I never touched that rose. I was feet away, in the crowd.”

“You told me you admired it up close before the judging. Before the crowd gathered.”

“I looked at it. I didn’t handle it. Someone else must have… or the print was transferred, or…” She floundered, seeing the cold certainty in his eyes.

“We also received an anonymous tip,” the younger officer said, his voice carefully neutral. “Suggesting we might want to check your gardening shed for… unusual chemicals.”

Elara felt a hot flush of anger. “Then check it. You’ll find bone meal, seaweed extract, and copper fungicide. Nothing that wouldn’t be in any serious gardener’s shed.”

“We intend to,” Henderson said. “But first, there’s another matter.” He took a small step forward. “The coroner confirmed the cyanide was likely airborne, inhaled directly from the flower. It would have required careful handling by the person who prepared it. We’re testing the gardening gloves of all persons of interest.”

“Persons of interest,” Elara repeated, the term chilling her more than the accusation.

“Standard procedure,” he said, but his tone was anything but standard. It was the voice of a man building a case. “I need to ask you to surrender any gardening gloves you used in the days leading up to the show. For testing.”

Elara stared at him. The community she loved, the charming, quirky town of Rosehaven, seemed to recede, leaving her isolated in this suddenly hostile room. They weren’t just asking for cooperation anymore. They were collecting evidence. Against her.

She thought of the broken vial, now sitting in its cardboard box upstairs. She had to tell him. But the words stuck in her throat. She had picked it up. Her prints were all over it now. How would that look, paired with the print on the rose holder and a public feud with the victim?

“My gloves,” she said finally, her voice surprisingly steady. “They’re in the mudroom. I’ll fetch them.”

As she walked out, she heard Henderson say quietly to the officer, “Stay with the dog.”

The hook was set. She was no longer just a witness with botanical knowledge. She was a suspect with motive, opportunity, and now, damning physical evidence slowly circling her. And as she retrieved her worn leather gloves, she realised with a sinking clarity that the real killer wasn’t just a murderer—they were a gardener who knew how to plant evidence, and they had chosen the most fertile soil possible: Elara Finch herself.
