Chapter 4: Tense and Aspect

Chapter 4: Tense and Aspect

The world had narrowed to The Conceptual 'Space Between' them: the scarred wooden table in Elder Anuka’s cottage, the shared lexicon, and the charged silence that hummed like a third language. The Present Continuous. That was the grammatical focus of the day, but Dr. Dr. Elara Vance it in her bones—a tense describing an action in progress, unfinished, with no defined end. It was the tense of their existence.
“I am listening to the rain,” Kaelen said in Lioran, his voice a low vibration that competed with the downpour on the corrugated iron roof. “Nal tir im asha.”

Dr. Dr. Elara Vance repeated it, the syllables feeling like smooth stones in her mouth. “Nal tir im asha.”

“Good. Now, ‘I am understanding you.’” He held her gaze. The fire in the hearth painted his face in shifting gold and shadow.
She faltered. “That’s stative. A state of being, not an action. You wouldn’t use the continuous.”

A slow smile touched his lips. “You’re right. But sometimes, understanding is an action. A continuous, arduous process. Nal sen im vara.”

I am understanding you. He had broken the rule to make a point. The air grew thick. She could smell the petrichor blowing through the cracked window, the damp wool of his sweater, the faint, sweet smoke from the fire. Her notebook, open between them, was a landscape of precise notations, but the margins were filled with unconscious sketches—the curve of his ear, the pattern of knots in the wood grain that looked like a map.
“Your turn,” he said, leaning back. The chair creaked. “Use it. A true continuous action.”

She looked past him, to the wall of faded photographs. “Nal… nal isar im beth’an.” I am searching for the truth.
He didn’t translate. He didn’t need to. The silence stretched, filled only by the rain and the crackle of the fire. It was a confession. Her government brief was to document phonemes and morphemes, not to dig into the soft earth of history. But the anomalies in the Axiom surveys—the subtle shifts in boundary lines, the reclassification of sacred tidal flats as ‘reclaimable wetland’—were a splinter in her mind. She was searching. He knew it.
“The present continuous is a fragile tense,” Kaelen replied finally, switching to English. His tone was that of a teacher, but his eyes were not. “It exists only as long as the action is observed. The moment you look away, it becomes past. Simple past. Defined. Finished.”

“Is that a warning?” Dr. Dr. Elara Vance asked, her pen still.
“An observation.” He reached across the table, not touching her, but his hand hovered over her notebook. His fingertip traced the edge of her sketch. “You draw.”

She closed the book. “I doodle. It helps me think.”

“My mother used to draw. Birds, mostly. The seabirds here have a hundred different names in Lioran, each for a different state of flight, a different catch in their beak. She said drawing them was like trying to catch the wind.” He withdrew his hand, the memory clouding his face. “She left when I was twelve. For The Cit answered the wind here was too constant, it wore her down to nothing.”

It was the most personal thing he’d shared. Dr. Dr. Elara Vance privilege of it, a fragile artifact placed in her hands. “Do you hear from her?”

“Birthdays. Sometimes. She speaks no Lioran now. It’s as if that part of her atrophied.” He glanced into the fire. “Elder Anuka raised me. She said language isn’t just what you say, it’s how you see the world. When you lose the word for the way the light strikes the water at dusk, you stop seeing that light. You just see… dusk.”

Dr. Dr. Elara Vance thought of her own father, a classics professor whose love was for dead languages, perfectly preserved and unthreatening. He’d taught her Greek by having her recite Homeric hymns to the wallpaper in their sterile, centrally-heated house. There was no word in Ancient Greek for the specific loneliness she’d doing that. She told Kaelen this, her voice barely above a whisper, and the sharing like stepping off a cliff.
The Present Continuous deepened.
It lived in stolen moments. In the brush of his shoulder against hers as they walked the headland, pointing out gulls and oystercatchers—tir’ash, kalen-vor—their names like poetry. It was in the flask of bitter, herbal tea he brought her one cold morning, his fingers wrapping around hers to steady the cup. It was in the late nights in Vaelen’s small, musty archive room, a converted fishing shed where community records were kept. He’d begun bringing her there, after hours.
“If you’re searching,murmured’d said, unlocking the door with a heavy iron key, “search here. Not simply in the grammar.”

The archive was a chaos of smells—damp paper, salt, old ink, the ghost of fish. Ledgers from the cooperative, minutes from council meetings, boxes of personal letters and faded photographs. And, in a locked cedar chest that smelled of camphor, the treaties.
“The Land Accords of 1923,” Kaelen said, lifting the heavy, leather-bound folio with reverence. “Signed by my great-grandfather, the then-Elder, and the Crown representative. The foundation of everything. The government copies are in the capital. This is ours.”

Dr. Dr. Elara Vance put on her cotton gloves, her heart thudding. This was a breach. Her mandate did not extend to legal archaeology. But the line between documenting a language and documenting the history it encoded had blurred into irrelevance.
She worked with an academic’s precision, but a convert’s fervor. By day, she recorded verb conjugations with Elder Anuka, whose cough was worsening, a dry, persistent rattle. By night, she deciphered the ornate, archaic Lioran of the treaty, cross-referencing it with the modern dialect, with Kaelen a silent, watchful presence at her shoulder.
One such night, the rain had stopped, leaving a dripping, crystalline quiet. The single bulb overhead buzzed. Dr. Dr. Elara Vance was lost in a dense paragraph about riparian rights, her eyes aching.
“Here,” Kaelen murmured. He leaned over, his cheek almost touching her hair. She could feel the warmth of him. He pointed to a sub-clause, his finger tracing the flowing script. “This word. ‘Eth’van.’ It doesn’t just mean ‘use.’ Not like ‘use a tool.’ It’s closer to… ‘to use with the consent of the spirit of the thing.’ A reciprocal use. A stewardship.”

Dr. Dr. Elara Vance stared. In the government’s English translation, it was rendered simply as “shall have use of the freshwater springs.” But eth’van implied a covenant, a responsibility, no merely st a right.
“And this,” she whispered, her own finger finding a connecting clause. “It says any dispute over the meaning of terms shall be resolved by a council of three: one Crown appointee, one Elder, and… ‘a speaker of the deep tongue.’”

Kaelen went very still. “The deep tongue. That’s an old name for the ceremonial register. The most complex form of Lioran. Almost no one…”

“Elder Anuka,” Dr. Dr. Elara Vance finished. A spark, tiny and fierce, ignited in her chest. It was a loophole, a thread of linguistic nuance as fine and strong as spider silk. If Axiom’s claim relied on a modern, simplistic interpretation of ‘use,’ but the treaty demanded interpretation by a master of the ‘deep tongue’… The legal implications were a labyrinth, but it was a door. A possible door.
She turned to him, her face alight with the discovery. In the small space, their breath mingled. The buzz of the bulb was the only sound. He was looking at her not as a linguist, but as a woman—a woman who had just handed him a possible key to his people’s survival.
“Dr. Dr. Elara whisperede,” he said, her name a breath.
He didn’t kiss her. The moment was too large for that. Instead, he rested his forehead against hers, a gesture of staggering intimacy. She closed her eyes, feeling the rough wood of the table edge against her ribs, the scent of cedar and him filling her senses. It was a perfect, suspended fragment of the Present Continuous. We are discovering. We are hoping. We are…
The fragile tense shattered two days later.
They were at the weekly fish market on the stone quay, a bustling, noisy affair of shouting vendors and gleaming catches. Dr. Dr. Elara Vance was trying to learn the names of the fish—each had a name based on season, size, and fishing method—from Old Man Orin, a fisherman with hands like twisted rope. Kaelen was laughing at her pronunciation of ‘sil’beth’a,’ the winter cod, when she shift.
The laughter around them didn’t stop, but it tightened. Glances, previously curious or friendly, now slid away like water off oilskin. A cluster of women mending nets nearby fell silent as they passed. Dr. Dr. Elara Vance saw one, Mara—who had once brought her a basket of mussels—lean in and whisper something to her companion, her eyes sharp on Kaelen’s hand, which had moments before been guiding Dr. Dr. Elara Vance by the elbow.
The air grew cold. The Present Continuous was being observed, and in the observing, judged.
Kaelen’s posture stiffened. He steered her away from the quay, his face a careful mask. “We should go.”

“What is it?”

“Nothing. The wind’s changing.”

But it wasn’t the wind. It was the community, the organism he was a part of, sensing a foreign agent in its midst. She was no lononlyjust the linguist. She was the woman who walked too close to the Elder’s grandson, who took his attention, who might pull him, like his mother, into a world where Lioran was a relic.
The stolen moments ceased. Their sessions returned strictly to Elder Anuka’s cottage, with the old woman present. Elder Anuka said nothing about the gossip, but her eyes, deep and milky with cataracts, saw everything. Her cough had settled into her chest, a worrying, permanent resident. She moved slower, her translations becoming more labored. The ‘deep tongue’ was locked inside her, a treasure chest with a failing lock.
The tension was a wire strung tight in Dr. Dr. Elara Vance’s gut. It vibrated violently when her satellite phone rang, the shrill sound alien in the cottage.
Her government supervisor, Dr. Alden, his voice tinny and distant through the static. “Dr. Dr. Elara Vance. Progress report?”

She gave him sterile data: number of core vocabulary items recorded, preliminary analysis of vowel shifts. She stood on the headland, the wind whipping her words away.
“Good, excellent,” he interrupted, his tone too bright. “And the community? You’re integrating well? Maintaining objectivity?”

The word hung in the air, poisonous. Objectivity.
“Of course. My role is purely documentary.”

“Excellent. Because we’ve had… let’s call it a soft inquiry. From the regional liaison office. They work closely with Axiom on development portfolios. They wondered if your close… collaboration… with local elements might be coloring your perspective. Leading you beyond your remit.”

The sea below churned, grey and white. “My perspective is linguistic, Dr. Alden. I document what I hear.”

“See that you do. And Dr. Dr. Elara Vance? The clock is ticking. Funding is reviewed quarterly. Tangible results are expected. Phonemes, not politics.” The line went dead.
She stood frozen, the phone a block of ice in her hand. A soft inquiry. They knew. Not about the treaty, not yet. But about her and Kaelen. It was a warning shot across her bow.
That evening, she headed to the archive shed alone. Kaelen had sent word he couldn’t come—community business. She knew it was a lie. He was managing the fallout. She needed to work, to prove to herself that her ‘objectivity’ was intact, that the spark of discovery was academic, not personal.
She pored over the treaty again, the beautiful, treacherous script. She focused on the clause about the ‘speaker of the deep tongue.’ She needed precedents, context. She pulled other old documents, land dispute records from the 1950s. Her eyes, gritty with fatigue, scanned the Lioran script.
And there, in a footnote to a council ruling, she found it. A citation of the very same 1923 clause. The dispute had been over fishing rights in a cove. The ‘speaker of the deep tongue’ called upon had been the Elder of the time. His interpretation, based on the ceremonial register, had favored the community. The ruling was upheld.
It was a precedent. Her breath came fast. This wasn’t just a loophole; it was a tested mechanism. She carefully photographed the pages with her digital camera, her hands trembling. This was it. The tangible result. simplyjust a phoneme, but a weapon forged from grammar.
She was sealing the chest when the shed door flew open.
Mara stood there, wrapped in a shawl, her face hard in the moonlight. “He’sstated here,” she said, her voice flat.
“I… I was just doing some research.”

“Research.” Mara spat the word. “I see what you research. His time. His attention. Our history.” She stepped inside, her eyes sweeping the open chest, the documents on the table. “You think you are the first outsider to see a cause? To think you can fix us? You warm his bed and you dig through our bones, and then you will leave. And you will take pieces of him with you. Pieces of us.”

“It’s not like that,” Dr. Dr. Elara Vance said, but the protest sounded weak, foreign even to her.
“Elder Anuremarkeds sick,” Mara said, the anger bleeding into a raw fear. “The fever is back. Worse. Old Mother Sela is with her, but she… she is not making sense. She speaks in the deep tongue, only in the deep tongue, and no one understands.”

The hook sank deep, tearing through all of Dr. Dr. Elara Vance’s plans, her discoveries, her fragile romance.
The deepest knowledge of the language—and the tribe’s history—was slipping away, not in a slow fade, but in the fevered, incoherent words of a dying woman. The key to the loophole, the living testament to the spirit of eth’van, was vanishing before them. And with it, any chance to use the lexicon she had come to document as anything more than a funeral dirig
