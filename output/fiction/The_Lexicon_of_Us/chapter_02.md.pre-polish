Chapter 2: Unconjugated Feelings

Chapter 2: Unconjugated Feelings

The morning fog was a living thing. It pressed itself against the windows of Elara’s rented cottage, a damp, grey breath that swallowed the line where the stony shore met the steel-wool sea. Inside, the world was reduced to the scent of wet pine from the stove, the scratch of her pen, and the spectral presence of Kaelen Mareth, who sat across the scarred oak table, a cup of untouched tea cooling between his hands.

They had fallen into a rhythm over the past fortnight. Mornings were for grammar, a skeletal architecture of rules. Afternoons were for lexicon, the flesh and blood of the language. But lately, the boundaries bled. Grammar felt like revelation; vocabulary like confession.

“Today,” Kaelen said, his voice a low vibration in the quiet room, “we should move to verbs of emotion. They are… complex in Lioran.”

Elara looked up from her notebook. He was studying the fog, his profile sharp against the muted light. He had a way of occupying space that was both utterly still and intensely present, like a coiled spring sheathed in velvet. She found herself cataloguing the details: the faint scar through his left eyebrow, the way his charcoal sweater stretched across his shoulders, the restless tap of his index finger against the ceramic mug. Data points in a study she was no longer conducting with academic detachment.

“Complex how?” she asked, her own voice sounding too bright, too clinical.

“They are often reflexive. Or reciprocal. The feeling is rarely owned by one person alone; it exists in the space between.” He turned his gaze to her, and the eye contact was a physical jolt. “For example, there is no word for ‘I love you.’ It is always ‘We love, you and I.’ ‘An-riel, sa’va.’ The verb ‘riel’ cannot be conjugated for a single subject.”

Elara wrote it down, the letters careful and precise. An-riel, sa’va. “So loneliness is baked into your grammar. The inability to feel something alone.”

A faint, surprised smile touched his lips. “You see the shadow first. Most people hear only the romance of connection. But yes. To speak of love is to acknowledge its necessary counterpart—the absence of it. It is a heavy word.”

The air in the cottage thickened. The hiss of the stove, the distant cry of a gull—everything receded, leaving only the charged space between them across the table. Elara felt a flush creep up her neck. She was a linguist. This was data. Yet her pulse thrummed in her throat.

“What about desire?” The question left her before she could vet it, raw and unmistakable.

Kaelen’s eyes darkened, holding hers. He didn’t look away. “Veth.” He said it softly, the ‘v’ a faint buzz, the ‘th’ a whispered breath. “It means a pull toward something essential. A current. It can be for a person, for the sea, for homecoming.”

“Veth,” she repeated, and the word felt dangerous on her tongue, a key turning in a lock.

“It is not a frantic wanting,” he continued, leaning forward slightly. The space between them diminished by a tangible degree. “It is a deep, patient recognition. A knowing that you are aligned, and to move against it is to deny your own nature.” He paused, searching her face. “Do you have a word for that?”

Elara’s mind, usually a library of cross-referenced terms, went blank. “No. We have ‘want,’ ‘crave,’ ‘yearn’… they all speak of a lack. An emptiness. Veth sounds like… a fullness.”

“It is,” he said simply.

The silence that followed was a language in itself. It was broken by the harsh electronic chirp of Kaelen’s satellite phone. He flinched, the spell shattering. Glancing at the screen, his expression closed, the open intensity replaced by a shuttered neutrality. “I must take this. Forgive me.”

He stood and moved to the far corner of the room, his back to her. His replies were terse. “Ae.… Na, na. Isha ven.… Tomor.” Yes. No. I will be there. Tomorrow.

When he returned, the lesson was over. The atmosphere had shifted from electrically intimate to politely strained. “Community matters,” he said, a bland explanation that explained nothing. “I will be late for our session tomorrow. There are… meetings.”

“Of course,” Elara said, the professional mask sliding back into place with an ache she refused to name. “I have the archival maps to correlate with the current surveys anyway.”

After he left, the cottage felt cavernous and cold. She tried to focus on her work, spreading the documents across the table. The government file contained crisp, recent topographical surveys commissioned by Axiom Global, the development corporation that had “partnered” with the Liora on sustainable tourism initiatives. They showed the coastline in sterile detail: elevation lines, hydrological markers, zones marked for “potential low-impact infrastructure.”

She compared them to the hand-drawn maps loaned to her by Kaelen’s grandmother, Saela. These were on thick, yellowing parchment, inked with a flowing, artistic hand. They didn’t just show land; they told stories. A cove was labelled ‘Breathing Bay’ with a note: ‘Here the cliffs echo twice at high tide.’ A forest grove was ‘The Whisperwood: the pines speak of the drowned ships.’

As she aligned the maps, a cold knot formed in her stomach. The discrepancies were subtle but undeniable. On the Axiom survey, a particular spit of land, marked on Saela’s map as ‘Kel-var’—which Kaelen had once translated as ‘the heart’s anchor’—was measured as a stable, rocky promontory. Saela’s map showed it as a delicate, curling finger of land, with a note in faded ink: ‘Tides of the great storm reshape her. She is a journey, not a place.’ More alarming was the hydrological data. The Axiom maps showed consistent, predictable water tables. The old maps indicated a vast, freshwater underground spring that fed the entire northern village, its flow marked as ‘the land’s pulse.’ On the new surveys, the spring was not noted at all.

It could be error. Modern precision versus folk memory. But the scientist in Elara, trained to spot patterns, saw a different story: a story of simplification, of erasure. A story where a ‘heart’s anchor’ became a buildable plot, and a land’s pulse was rendered invisible.

The next day, Kaelen was absent. The fog had burned off, leaving a sky of hard, clear blue. Restless, Elara took her notes and walked the winding path down to the main harbour. She told herself she needed context for the coastal place-names.

The harbour was a bustle of dissonant energies. Traditional Lioran fishing boats, painted with fading eyes and wave motifs, bobbed beside a sleek, white Axiom cruiser. Men in oilskins mended nets, their laughter sharp and short, while men in branded polar fleeces unloaded crates of surveying equipment.

And then she saw him. Kaelen, standing on the weathered planks of the main dock, was not the patient teacher or the man of quiet intensity. He was a pillar of contained fury. Opposite him was a man Elara recognized from Axiom’s orientation packet—Charles Denton, the regional liaison. Denton had a smile that didn’t reach his eyes and a suit too crisp for the salt air.

Elara ducked behind a stack of crab pots, the scent of brine and decay thick in her nostrils.

“—a misunderstanding, Kaelen,” Denton was saying, his voice carrying a placating, patronising tone. “The surveys are scientific. They help us help you. The community centre, the improved moorings…”

“Your surveys are blind,” Kaelen cut in, his voice low but carrying like a cold wind. “They see dirt and rock. They do not see ‘isha’.”

“Isha?” Denton chuckled. “See? This is what we’re preserving. The poetry. But poetry doesn’t hold back the sea or bring in jobs.”

“What it holds back is more important than your sea walls.” Kaelen took a step closer. “The spring at Kel-var. Your maps ignore it. If you dig where your plans indicate, you will cut the vein that feeds half the village. You will turn ‘the land’s pulse’ into a mudflat.”

Denton’s smile hardened. “Our hydrologists are the best in the world. If there was a significant spring, they’d have found it. Perhaps your stories have… shifted the geography over time.”

The insult hung in the air. Kaelen went very still. Elara, from her hiding place, saw the tension cord the muscles in his jaw. “Our stories are the geography,” he said, each word a stone dropped. “The meeting is over. The council will not approve the revised plans.”

He turned and walked away, his stride long and angry. Denton watched him go, the false smile vanishing, replaced by a look of cold calculation.

Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs. This was the conflict simmering beneath the surface of her language project. She felt like a thief, having witnessed it.

That evening, he came to her cottage as if nothing had happened. But the energy around him was different, jagged. The easy intimacy of the previous morning was gone.

“I am poor company tonight,” he said, standing at the hearth rather than sitting. “Forgive me.”

“I was at the harbour today,” she said quietly, not looking up from her notebook. “I saw you. With Denton.”

He was silent for a long moment. “Then you saw a man trying to sell a lie wrapped in a brochure.”

“The spring,” she ventured. “On the old maps. It’s real?”

“As real as the blood in your veins.” He ran a hand through his hair, a gesture of profound weariness. “To the instruments, it is a trickle, dispersed through shale. To us, it is a single, living source. They see separate data points. We see a relationship.”

“And they’re going to destroy it.”

“They will try.” He finally looked at her, his eyes haunted. “This is what it means to be Lioran now. To be a curator of endings.”

The despair in his voice undid her. She stood, moving to the window, needing distance from the pull she felt toward him. “Teach me a word,” she said, her back to him. “Not for desire, or love. Teach me a word for what you’re doing. For what you feel you must do.”

Behind her, she heard him let out a long, slow breath. When he spoke, his voice was closer. He had moved to stand behind her, not touching, but she could feel the heat of him.

“Rya’val,” he said, the word guttural and strong. “It is an active verb. There is no direct translation. It means… to stand between what you love and the coming tide. To protect, knowing the cost will be a piece of yourself, and that you may still fail. It is not a noble sacrifice. It is a desperate, stubborn anchoring.”

Rya’val. Elara turned to face him. He was so close she could see the flecks of sea-green in his grey eyes, the faint stubble shadowing his jaw. The air crackled with the day’s tension and all the unspoken words of the weeks before. She saw the argument on the dock, the weight of his duty, the fading language, the hidden spring—all of it held in the lines of his face. And she saw, with a clarity that stole her breath, that she was no longer just an observer. She was becoming part of the thing he felt he must rya’val.

“It’s a beautiful word,” she whispered, her academic detachment in ashes.

“It is a heavy one,” he repeated, his gaze dropping to her lips for a heartbeat before he stepped back, breaking the connection. “I should go.”

After he left, the cottage felt charged with his absence. Elara tried to read but couldn’t focus. Remembering he’d left his modern laptop charger plugged in by the sofa the day before, she picked it up, deciding to take it to him as an excuse, a reason to bridge the distance that had both narrowed and widened tonight.

His family’s home was a long, low house of stone and weathered wood on the higher bluff. A light was on in the kitchen, but the front door was unlocked and silent when she pushed it open. “Kaelen?” she called softly. No answer.

She saw his laptop, open on the large table in the living room, its screen casting a blue glow on the polished wood. She moved to leave the charger beside it when the words on the screen froze her in place.

The document was a legal filing. The header was stark and official. IN THE MATTER OF LIORA COMMUNITY COUNCIL vs. AXION GLOBAL RESOURCES & DEVELOPMENT. Her eyes, trained for rapid reading, skimmed the dense text.

…seeking a class action injunction to halt all coastal development pending independent environmental and cultural impact assessments…

…plaintiffs allege deliberate misrepresentation of hydrological and geological data…

…further allege coercion of council members through predatory leasing agreements…

This was the fight. This was the true ‘community matter.’ It wasn’t just disagreement; it was a war, and Kaelen was on the front lines.

Footsteps sounded in the hallway. Elara’s head snapped up. Kaelen stood in the doorway, his face pale in the dim light. His eyes went from her face to the open laptop, and a storm of emotions crossed his features—shock, violation, then a swift, defensive hardening.

He crossed the room in three quick strides and snapped the laptop shut. The sound was like a gunshot in the quiet room.

The air turned to ice. He didn’t speak, just stared at her, his chest rising and falling with a controlled rhythm. The man who had taught her words for desire and sacred protection was gone. In his place was a strategist, caught.

“I…” Elara stammered, holding up the charger like a pathetic talisman. “You left this. The door was open.”

His gaze was unreadable, a wall of sea-fog. “You should go, Elara.”

“Kaelen, I…”

“Go.” The word was not loud, but it was final, a door slamming shut on more than just the conversation.

She turned and fled into the night, the cold air biting her cheeks. The hook she had sought for her research was now buried in her heart. She had gone looking for the meaning of rya’val. Now, she was entangled in its cost. And the last thing she had seen, seared behind her eyes before the screen went dark, was the name listed as the lead plaintiff and primary point of contact for the class action injunction.

Kaelen J. Mareth.
