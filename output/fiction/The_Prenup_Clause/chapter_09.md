Chapter 9: The Love Audit

Chapter 9: The Love Audit

The morning of the executor’s arrival dawned with the kind of pristine, blue-skied clarity that felt like a personal insult. After the storm’s catharsis, the world had been washed clean, leaving Elara and Kai in a state of fragile, unspoken truce. They’d spent the last week moving around each other like two positively charged magnets—close, but with an invisible force field of ‘what-now’ keeping them from touching.

The scent of Kai’s coffee, usually a comforting anchor, now smelled like impending verdict. Elara stood at the kitchen window of the inn, watching a rental car creep up the coastal road. “He’s here,” she said, her voice oddly calm.

Kai joined her, his shoulder a hair’s breadth from hers. She could feel the warmth. “Right on time. Bernard never misses a deadline.”

“Unlike us,” Elara murmured.

Bernard Finch was a human exclamation point in a three-piece suit. He bustled into the foyer, a leather briefcase in one hand and a look of severe efficiency on his face. “Elara! Kai! One year. My, how time flies when you’re… complying with contractual obligations.”

“Lovely to see you too, Bernard,” Kai said, shaking his hand. “Can I offer you a drink? Coffee? Something stronger?”

“Business before pleasure, always,” Bernard chirped, setting up shop at the polished reception desk. “Now, as per the terms of the late Mr. Sterling’s will, I am here to conduct a final review of your marital… bona fides. I’ll need to interview you separately. Elara, shall we begin?”

The parlor felt like a principal’s office. Bernard sat in a wingback chair, a notepad on his knee, his pen poised. “Now, Elara. This is just a formality. A series of simple questions to ascertain the, ah, authenticity of the union.”

“Fire away,” she said, folding her hands in her lap to hide their tremor.

“Question one: What is your husband’s favourite colour?”

Elara blinked. “Seriously?”

“The mundane often reveals the intimate.”

She didn’t even have to think. “It’s not a single colour. It’s the specific grey-green of the ocean about thirty minutes before a storm hits. He says it looks like trouble, but the good kind.”

Bernard’s pen scratched. “Interesting. Question two: What is Kai’s most irrational fear?”

A week ago, she might have said ‘commitment’ or ‘tax audits.’ Now, she knew. “Commercial-grade dishwashers. The industrial ones with the roaring sound. He had a traumatic bussing experience at sixteen. He’ll hand-wash a mountain of glasses rather than turn one on.”

“Fascinating.” Bernard adjusted his glasses. “Now, more substantively. Where do you, as a couple, see yourselves in five years?”

The air left the room. This wasn’t about facts; this was about futures. Elara’s carefully constructed script—the inn is thriving, we have separate but amicable lives—dissolved on her tongue. The truth, raw and unvarnished, pushed its way out.

“Here,” she said softly, looking out at the garden Kai had resurrected. “Arguing over paint samples for the east rooms. Trying to keep Mrs. Henderson from feeding bacon to the seagulls. Him in his workshop at dawn, me burning the first batch of scones. Me trying to drag him to a gallery opening in the city, him trying to convince me to go camping in a place with more bears than Wi-Fi bars. Compromising on a terrible romantic comedy at that old cinema in town. Here. Together. Just… more of this.”

The scratching of Bernard’s pen stopped. He simply looked at her for a long moment, his professional veneer cracking to reveal something akin to pity. “Thank you, Elara. That will be all. Please send in Kai.”

Kai’s interview was, unknown to him, a mirror image. His answer to “What is your wife’s most cherished possession?” wasn’t her grandmother’s pearls, but the first, wildly inaccurate ledger she’d kept for the inn, which she’d framed as a reminder of how far she’d come. When Bernard asked about their future, Kai, who had entered ready to spin a tale of friendly co-ownership, found himself describing a detailed plan for a glass-walled extension to the inn’s library, because Elara loved the light in the afternoons.

Bernard reconvened them in the parlor, his expression inscrutable. He placed his notepad in his briefcase with a definitive snap. “Well. That was remarkably… congruent.”

“Is that good?” Kai asked, his hand finding Elara’s on the sofa cushion. They both stared at their linked fingers as if they belonged to strangers.

“It is either very good, or very bad, depending on your original objectives,” Bernard said. He pulled a single, cream-colored envelope from his case. “There is, however, one final piece of business to address before we proceed. Kai, this arrived at my office, forwarded per your instructions. It concerns your tech startup.”

Kai took the envelope, a cold dread seeping into his stomach. He tore it open. Elara watched his face, saw the blood drain from it, then return in a flush. His hand tightened on hers.

“It’s the offer,” he said, his voice hollow. “From Axiom Ventures. The full buyout. The number we… the number I needed.”

The original goal. The entire reason for the paper marriage, the shared bed, the storm, the kisses that tasted of rain and revelation. It was here, on heavy bond paper with a staggering string of zeroes.

“Congratulations,” Bernard said, without warmth. “The condition of the will is therefore satisfied. You have the capital to save your business independently. My review, while… illuminating, is ultimately secondary. The choice is now entirely yours. Do you wish to continue the marriage, or shall I file the annulment papers?”

The silence was a physical thing, thick and suffocating. Elara’s mind raced. This was the off-ramp. The clean, agreed-upon exit. He had his money. She had the inn, safe from her family’s meddling. They had both gotten exactly what they’d wanted. To stay now would be to choose a messy, unpredictable, terrifying real thing over a safe, successful fiction.

She pulled her hand from his, the loss of contact immediate and painful. “Well,” she said, the words brittle and bright as glass. “That’s that, then. Mission accomplished.” She forced a smile that felt like a crack in porcelain. “We should just take the annulment. Get what we wanted. No messy feelings to complicate a perfectly good business deal.”

Kai looked at her, and she saw the same frantic calculation in his eyes, the same cowardice masquerading as pragmatism. He was retreating, and she was giving him the bridge to burn. “Right,” he said, the word clipped. “No complications. The deal was the deal.”

He wasn’t fighting. The realization was a ice pick to her ribs. He was agreeing. Of course he was. The money was real. What was between them was just… weather. A storm that had passed.

“Very well,” Bernard said, his voice heavy. He produced a second, thinner folder. Two sheets of paper. The annulment. “Sign here, and here. I’ll witness.”

The pen Bernard offered was a sleek, silver thing. It felt like lead in Elara’s hand. She stared at the line. Elara Vivian Sterling. She’d practiced this signature a hundred times as a girl, dreaming of the sophisticated woman she’d become. She’d never dreamed she’d use it to undo a marriage that had become the most real thing in her life.

She scrawled her name. The ink looked black as a void.

Kai took the pen. His jaw was a hard line. He didn’t look at her. He signed Kai Jameson with a swift, brutal stroke, as if beheading the words.

Bernard gathered the papers, his movements slow, almost reluctant. “I’ll file these immediately. The annulment will be effective by end of business today.” He stood. “For what it’s worth, from a purely observational standpoint… my condolences.”

And then he was gone, leaving them alone in the parlor that still held the ghost of their laughter, the echoes of their whispered arguments, the imprint of their bodies on the sofa where they’d first tentatively held hands.

The sound of his car engine faded down the lane.

The silence expanded, a living thing.

Elara couldn’t breathe. She focused on a sunbeam, motes of dust dancing in it like frantic, doomed stars. She had to move, to speak, to shatter this before it shattered her.

“So,” she said, her voice high and strange. “I suppose you’ll be heading back to the city. To celebrate your buyout.”

Kai was staring at the empty fireplace. “Yeah. I suppose I will.”

“You should. It’s what you worked for.”

“It is.”

Another endless minute passed. The grandfather clock in the hall ticked like a countdown to nothing.

“I have… I should check on the linen delivery,” Elara said, standing abruptly. She needed walls, doors, distance. She couldn’t be in this room with him and the monumental, stupid thing they had just done.

“Elara.” His voice stopped her at the doorway. It was raw, stripped bare.

She turned, hope—stupid, desperate hope—flaring in her chest.

He hadn’t moved. His back was to her, shoulders tense. “The east rooms,” he said, to the fireplace. “You’re right. They’d look good in that sage green you liked. The one you said was ‘serene but not boring.’”

It was a gift. And a goodbye. The detail was so specific, so theirs, it eviscerated her.

She couldn’t speak. She just nodded, though he couldn’t see it, and walked out.

The rest of the day was a study in brutal, polite avoidance. They were exquisitely courteous, two ghosts haunting the same house. Kai packed his things from their—her—bedroom, moving his few belongings back to the original guest room he’d used when he first arrived. The sound of drawers opening and closing was like gunshots.

At dinner, they sat at opposite ends of the long kitchen table, the space between them a yawning chasm.

“The weather looks clear for your drive tomorrow,” she said, pushing a pea around her plate.

“Good. That’s good.”

“I’ll settle the final utilities split with Bernard.”

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll cover it.”

“No, we agreed fifty-fifty.”

“Right. Of course.”

The conversation died, strangled by the things they couldn’t say: Stay. Fight. This is a mistake. I love you.

Later, in the deep indigo of midnight, Elara lay in the too-big bed, listening. She heard the floorboard creak outside her door. A pause. Then, the soft sound of footsteps moving away, down the stairs.

She didn’t sleep.

An hour before dawn, she gave up. She wrapped herself in a cardigan and padded downstairs. The inn was cold, the warmth of the day long gone. She went to the back porch, seeking air.

He was there.

Kai stood at the railing, a silhouette against the pre-dawn gloom, a single duffel bag at his feet. He was watching the ocean, now the colour of a fresh bruise. He didn’t turn as she stepped out.

“Couldn’t sleep?” he asked, his voice gravelly.

“No.”

“Me either.”

They stood in silence, side-by-side but not touching, watching the faint light begin to bleed into the horizon. This was their last shared dawn.

“You’ll make the inn incredible,” he said finally. “It already is.”

“You’ll build an empire with that buyout,” she replied. “You already have.”

It was the epitaph for their marriage. Polite. Full of praise. Absolutely empty.

He bent and picked up his bag. The movement was final. This was it. He would walk to his car, and he would drive away, and the year would fold up like a set piece, stored away in memory.

He turned to her, and in the half-light, his face was all shadows and regret. “Goodbye, Elara.”

Don’t go. I love you. I’m scared. The words screamed in her head, but her throat had sealed itself shut. All she could manage was a whisper. “Goodbye, Kai.”

He leaned in. For a heart-stopping second, she thought he would kiss her. Instead, his lips brushed her cheek—a chaste, devastating whisper of contact that held the ghost of every real kiss they’d ever shared. It was a kiss for the annulment papers. A kiss for the deal.

Then he turned and walked down the porch steps, across the dewy grass to his car. The engine started, a rude intrusion on the quiet morning. He didn’t look back.

Elara watched the taillights disappear around the bend, until the red glow was swallowed by the grey road and the gathering light. She stood there until the sun was fully up, painting the world in golds and pinks she couldn’t feel.

She went inside. The inn was silent. It was all hers. She had won.

She walked into the parlor, where the ghost of their signatures still seemed to hang in the air. She needed to work, to clean, to do anything. She bent to plump a cushion on the sofa and saw it, glinting in the morning sun.

On the floor, half-kicked under the coffee table, was Kai’s simple, worn silver wedding band. He must have pulled it off last night, forgotten in his anguish.

She picked it up. It was warm from the sunbeam. She closed her fist around it, the metal biting into her palm. And there, alone in the perfect, empty silence of her victory, Elara Sterling finally let the tears come, sliding down her face as she clutched the only tangible piece left of her husband.

Hook: Three days later, a courier delivered a thick, legal-looking envelope to the inn. It wasn’t from Bernard. The return address was a prestigious city law firm Elara didn’t recognize. Inside, atop a stack of dense documents, was a sticky note in familiar, slashing handwriting: “Turns out, I hate commercial dishwashers more than I hate complicated contracts. Read the addendum.”
