Chapter 7: Town Hall and Turmoil

The air in Willow Creek during the Summer Solstice Festival was a specific, potent cocktail: the sticky-sweet scent of spun sugar, the earthy perfume of damp grass underfoot, the tang of citronella candles fighting a losing battle against mosquitoes, and the overwhelming, cloying aroma of small-town suspicion.

Elara felt it the moment she and Kai stepped onto the green. It was in the way Mrs. Henderson’s chatter with the florist stall owner cut off abruptly as they passed, resuming in a hushed, urgent whisper. It was in the overly hearty clap on Kai’s back from Mayor Gibbons, whose eyes darted between them like a suspicious magpie. It was in the pitying smile sent her way by the owner of the antique store, a smile that said, ‘You poor, transparent thing.’

“The rumor mill,” Elara muttered, adjusting the strap of her sundress, “is apparently powered by festival-grade diesel today.”

Kai, looking infuriatingly unruffled in a faded, soft-looking t-shirt and jeans, handed her a paper cone of lemonade. “Relax. They’re just jealous of my devastatingly handsome profile.”

“They think we’re a sham, Kai. A business transaction with a guest bedroom.” She took a sip, the tartness a shock. “The inn’s credibility hinges on us being a love story, not a corporate merger. And right now, the town’s audit is not looking good.”

He leaned against the trunk of the ancient oak that served as the festival’s centerpiece. “So we give them a show. A good one. We’re good at that.”

They were. The ‘date’ for the executor had been a masterclass in performative affection, all lingering touches and shared smiles that had left Elara’s skin humming for hours afterward. The memory of it—of his hand on the small of her back, of the way he’d laughed at her terrible joke about the sommelier—was a persistent, unwelcome ghost in her spreadsheet-filled mind.

“A show,” she echoed, watching a group of children tumble in the sack race. “Right.”

The festival unfolded in a series of charming, relentless tests. They were corralled into judging the pie contest (Kai, with a theatrical flourish, fed her a bite of his blueberry ribbon winner, his thumb brushing her lower lip, making her forget the names of all other fruits). They were drafted into the three-legged race, tied together at the ankle, their bodies pressed from hip to shoulder as they hobbled and laughed, a chaotic, breathless unity that felt more natural than it should. Each touch was a lit match, and the air between them was starting to smell like smoke.

As dusk painted the sky in watercolor streaks of peach and lavender, the string lights strung between the trees flickered on, and the band—a surprisingly competent group of local dads called “The Midlife Mandolins”—struck up a slow, twangy tune. The town dance was beginning.

Mayor Gibbons, a portly man with a microphone that loved him more than anyone else did, boomed over the speakers. “Alright, folks! Time for the highlight of our evening—the Golden Oak Couples’ Contest! As you know, the winners get their names engraved on the plaque in the town hall and a year’s supply of pie from Henderson’s Bakery. Now, do we have our first brave pair of lovebirds?”

Elara felt a cold dread drip down her spine. She tried to melt into the shadows of the oak tree.

“Oh, look,” Kai said, his voice a low rumble beside her ear. “Our public demands a finale.”

Before she could protest, a chorus of voices rose around them.

“Elara and Kai! Give the new innkeepers a shot!”
“Come on, you two!”
“Let’s see that big-city romance, Kai!”

It was a friendly mob, armed with sparklers and peer pressure. Mrs. Henderson gave her a gentle, inescapable push toward the dance floor, a makeshift platform of wooden planks laid over the grass.

Trapped. Elara shot Kai a panicked look. He merely offered her his hand, a lazy, confident smile on his face that didn’t quite reach his eyes. She took it, her palm meeting his, and the familiar jolt of warmth shot up her arm.

They were herded onto the platform with three other couples: the elderly Millers, who had been dancing together for fifty years; Billy and Chrissy, teenagers radiating awkward, fervent passion; and the competitive Johnsons, who practiced ballroom every Tuesday.

The music shifted into a slow, swaying country ballad. Kai’s hands came to her waist, settling there with an ease that stole her breath. Her arms went up around his neck, her fingers brushing the soft hair at his nape. It was the pose from a thousand performances, but the stage had never felt so intimate, the audience so irrelevant.

“Just follow my lead,” he murmured, his breath stirring the hair at her temple.

“You lead? Based on your rhythm during the three-legged race, that’s a terrifying proposition.”

He chuckled, the sound vibrating through his chest into hers. “Hush. We’re being poignant.”

They began to move, a simple, shuffling box step. At first, Elara was hyper-aware of every eye on them, of the critical gazes measuring the space between their bodies (too much? too little?), the authenticity of her smile (too stiff? too giddy?). She catalogued the sensations: the rough denim of his jeans against her bare legs, the solid plane of his chest, the faint, clean scent of his soap mixed with summer night.

Then, something shifted.

Kai’s hand slid from her waist to the center of her back, drawing her a fraction closer. The space between them dissolved. Her cheek came to rest naturally against his shoulder. The chatter of the crowd, the twang of the mandolin, the buzz of the insects—it all faded into a distant hum. The only clear sounds were the soft scuff of their feet on the wood and the steady, strong beat of his heart under her ear.

She wasn’t thinking about the town, or the inn, or the contract. She was thinking about the way his thumb was making tiny, absent circles on her spine. She was thinking about the wedding last week, how he’d calmly rerouted a delivery disaster and calmed a hysterical mother-of-the-bride with a joke, his competence a quiet, shocking revelation. She was thinking about the way he’d stacked the dishwasher that morning, incorrectly but with a sort of optimistic zeal that made her laugh instead of sigh.

“You’re thinking very loudly,” he murmured into her hair.

“I’m calculating the statistical probability of the Johnsons using a forbidden dip.”

“Liar. You’re thinking about my dishwasher loading. Admit it. It was innovative.”

A genuine laugh bubbled out of her. She tilted her head back to look at him. The colored string lights reflected in his dark eyes, turning them into galaxies of gold and green. His smile was no longer a performance. It was soft, wondering, and entirely for her.

The world had shrunk to this square of wood, to this circle of his arms.

The music swelled. The other couples became blurs at the edges of her vision. There was no audience, no contest. There was only Kai’s guiding pressure, the syncopated rhythm of their breathing falling into unison, the heat of his hand on her back seeping through the cotton of her dress. He spun her out, then reeled her back in, and she came without thought, trusting his lead implicitly, her body fitting against his as if the blueprint had been drawn a lifetime ago.

When the final chord of the song hung in the air, they didn’t stop. They were still swaying, lost in the after-echo, in the private universe they’d built in three minutes. Kai’s gaze dropped to her lips. Her breath hitched.

And then he dipped her.

It wasn’t a showy, contest-winning dip. It was slow, deep, and inevitable. Her back arched over his arm, her hair brushing the planks. The night sky, now a velvety indigo scattered with early stars, filled her vision. Then his face blocked it out. His expression was utterly unguarded—a mix of awe, confusion, and a yearning so raw it made her heart clench.

He kissed her.

It was not for show.

It was not a peck,
