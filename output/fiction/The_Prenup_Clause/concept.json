  "title": "The Prenup Clause",
  "genre": "romance",
  "subgenre": "romantic comedy",
  "premise": "A fiercely independent, perpetually single event planner accidentally triggers a forgotten clause in her eccentric aunt's will: to inherit the family's historic coastal inn, she must be married within a year. In a panic, she enters a strictly business arrangement with her charming but infuriatingly laid-back rival, a local surf instructor, who needs capital to save his own business. Their contract stipulates 'no feelings, just facilitation,' but sharing a roof\u2014and fending off skeptical townsfolk\u2014proves that the most binding contracts are the ones written on the heart.",
  "protagonist": "Maya Vance, a type-A, spreadsheet-loving event planner whose life is a meticulously color-coded calendar.",
  "conflict": "Maya must maintain a convincing public facade of a happy marriage with her polar opposite, Leo, while battling their growing, inconvenient attraction and the terms of their ironclad prenuptial agreement, which promises a clean, emotionless split in twelve months.",
  "setting": "Present-day in the quirky, gossipy seaside town of Seabrook Cove, centered around the charming but rundown 'Harbor Light Inn.'",
  "tone": "Witty, warm, and fizzy with banter, balancing laugh-out-loud situational comedy with genuine, slow-burn romantic tension."
