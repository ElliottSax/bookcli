Chapter 5: The Rival Reformation

The morning of the Vandergraft-Smythe wedding dawned with the kind of pristine, cloudless perfection that Elara knew was a lie. Beautiful weather was just nature’s way of lulling you into a false sense of security before the caterer’s van broke down.
She stood in the center of the inn’s sun-drenched garden, a clipboard pressed to her chest like a shield. The air smelled of jasmine and impending doom. Around her, the scene was one of controlled chaos: florists wrestled with archways of peonies, a string quartet argued over shade placement, and the heady scent of beeswax candles from the gift table warred with the salt-kissed breeze.
And at the epicenter of it all, was the bride.
Bianca Vandergraft-Smythe (the hyphen was new, and wielded like a weapon) was a vision in a silk robe, her face a thundercloud. She held a canapé aloft as if it were a piece of forensic evidence.
“This,” Bianca declared, her voice slicing through the hum of activity, “is lukewarm. The salmon mousse should be a cool kiss on the palate, not a tepid slap. Are we savages?”

Elara’s smile bolted to her face. “Of course not, Bianca. We’ll have it rectified immediately.” She caught the eye of a harried server, who scurried off, looking pale.
This wedding was a tipping point. The Vandergrafts knew people. The right people. A success meant glowing reviews in society blogs and a waiting list a year long. A failure meant a slow, gossip-fueled death for the Driftwood Inn.
“And the champagne flutes,” Bianca continued, turning her gimlet gaze to the reception tables. “I specified Riedel, not these… provincial tumblers. This isn’t a barn dance.”

“Those are Riedel, Bianca,” Elara said, her tone smooth as the linen tablecloths. “The ‘Sommeliers’ series, just as you requested.”

Bianca peered closer, her nostrils flaring. “Hmm. The light is deceptive. But the ice sculpture. It’s listing. It looks like a drunken swan.”

Elara squinted at the two-foot-tall crystal swan. It looked perfectly upright to her, but arguing with a bride on her wedding day was like arguing with a tornado. You simply had to board up the windows and hope.
“I’ll have the sculptor adjust it.”

“See that you do. And where is my fiancé? Jeremy! Has anyone seen Jeremy? If he’s in the billiards room with that awful Scotch again, I’ll…”

As Bianca stormed off in a swirl of silk, Elara let her shoulders drop a fraction. A headache, fine as a needle, pulse behind her left eye. She was calculating the risk of sprinting to her office for aspirin when a familiar, languid drawl cut through the tension.
“So, the General’s on the warpath, huh?”

Kai leaned against the stone archway leading to the patio, a picture of infuriating calm. He wore dark trousers and a white linen shirt, sleeves rolled to his elbows, looking less like a temporary husband and more like a yacht captain who’d wandered off course. The morning sun caught the gold in his tousled hair.
“She’s not a general,” Elara muttered, scanning her clipboard. “She’s a five-star field marshal. And the pastry chef just called. The vintage delivery van for the croquembouche has thrown a rod in Hilo. No back-up. We have a three-foot tower of profiteroles that will never make it here.”

A crisis. A real, reputation-ending crisis. This was her wheelhouse. She’d already run through three solutions, all bad. Her mind was a spreadsheet of failure probabilities.
Kai pushed off the wall and ambled over. He plucked a stray berry from a passing garnish tray and popped it in his mouth. “Who’s the supplier?”

“Le Rêve Patisserie. From Hilo. They’re the only ones who could do the gold-leaf detail she demanded.”

“Hmm.” Kai pulled his phone from his pocket, scrolled for a moment, and put it to his ear. He turned slightly away, but she caught the easy, familiar tone. “Tutu Eleanor? Yeah, it’s Kai. How’s the knee? … Good, good. Listen, I need a kuleana. A friend’s in a bind. You know Marcel at Le Rêve? … Yeah, that’s the one. His van died with a wedding cake on board… Uh-huh. You’re a lifesaver. Tell Uncle Bobby I’ll be by for that tune-up next week. Mahalo nui.”

He hung up and looked at Elara, who was staring at him, her pen frozen mid-checklist.
“Uncle Bobby runs a classic car restoration shop in Hilo. He’s also Marcel’s brother-in-law. He’s loading the croquembouche into his ’59 Cadillac Coupe de Ville and driving it over himself. Should be here in forty minutes. Air conditioning on full blast.”

Elara’s mouth was slightly open. The spreadsheet in her mind dissolved into static. “You… yo merely st…”

“Used my nefarious local network for excellent,” he finished, a ghost of a smile on his lips. “Don’t look so shocked, Boss. I told you I had my uses.”

He sauntered away to calmly redirect a lost groomsman before she could form a response. The simple, effortless solution left her feeling oddly unbalanced, as if the floor had tilted. She’d been prepared for a fight, for a scramble, for disaster. She hadn’t been prepared for that.
The ceremony proceeded with only minor hiccups (the ring bearer, a nephew of the groom, cried until his mother produced a fruit snack). As Bianca and Jeremy said their vows, Elara allowed herself a moment to lean against a hidden corner of the veranda, the ocean a sparkling backdrop to the union. Her eyes scanned the crowd, the staff, ensuring every glass was full, every napkin folded.
They landed on Kai.
He wasn’t with the guests. He was down on the beach, just beyond the inn’s lawn, where the ceremony’s gentle soundtrack faded into the crash of waves. The little ring bearer, now pacified and still in his miniature suit, was with him. Kai had shed his linen shirt, leaving him in a simple white tee, and was kneeling in the wet sand.
Elara watched, hidden by a bougainvillea trellis. Kai held a small, beginner’s surfboard steady in the shallow foam. The little boy, his earlier tears forgotten, was lying on it, his small hands gripping the rails. Kai’s voice, too low to hear over the waves, was a steady, patient rumble. He demonstrated a paddling motion. The boy copied, his movements exaggerated and eager. Then, as a gentle, foaming wave rolled in, Kai gave the board a soft push and jogged alongside it, one hand steadying the tail, his other encouraging the boy. “Up! Now, easy… there you go!”

The boy popped to his knees, then, wobbling, to his feet, arms windmilling. He stayed upright for all of three seconds before tumbling into the knee-deep water with a splash. Instead of scolding, Kai laughed—a warm, full sound that carried on the wind—and hauled the sputtering, giggling child up. “That was awesome! You caught the whitewater! Next time, you’ll ride it to the sand.”

He high-fived the boy, his attention complete, his earlier nonchalance replaced by a focused, gentle encouragement. Elara’s breath caught. This was a side of the man she’d married—the man she’d categorized as a charming, capital-seeking dilettante—that her carefully constructed mental file had no folder for. The sight of him, patient and kind, water darkening the hem of his trousers, sent a confusing warmth through her chest, entirely separate from the Hawaiian sun.
The reception was a whirl of champagne toasts and strategically deployed hors d'oeuvres. The croquembouche arrived, majestic and intact, in a gleaming pink Cadillac, to Bianca’s stunned delight. Elara managed the flow like a symphony conductor, but her eyes kept finding Kai. He was mingling, not with the slick, investment-banker friends of the groom as she’d expected, but with the elderly aunt from Minnesota, making her laugh; with the shy teenage cousin, asking about her music. He was using that same easy charm, but it didn’t feel calculated. It felt… genuine.
The crisis came during the father-daughter dance. Elara was at the catering station, confirming the timing of the cake cutting, when the head server, Miguel, rushed up, panic in his eyes.
“The generator for the fairy lights in the banyan tonlyjust died. The entire canopy is going dark in five minutes. The spare is in the maintenance shed, but the lock is rusted shut. We can’t find the bolt cutters.”

The banyan tree, strung with a thousand tiny lights, was the reception’s magical centerpiece. To have it go dark during the heart of the party would be a catastrophic mood-killer. Bianca would have an aneurysm.
Before Elara could even formulate a curse, Kai was there. He’d overheard. “Rusted lock on the shed? Back corner near the old well?”

Miguel nodded.
“I know the one. Come with me.”

Elara followed, her heels sinking into the lawn. By the time they reached the dilapidated wooden shed, Kai was already examining the heavy padlock. He didn’t look for bolt cutters. He jogged to the nearby garden hose spigot, turned it on, and soaked the bandana he’d pulled from his pocket. He wrapped the wet cloth tightly around the shackle of the lock, then took the tiny, sturdy pocket knife he always carried—the one she’d teased him about—and wedged the blade between the cloth and the lock.
“What are you doing?” Elara hissed.
“Rust is hydrated iron oxide. The water helps break it up. The cloth gives the blade purchase.” He applied a sharp, twisting pressure. There was a harsh, metallic screech, and the lock popped open. “use. Physics. And a little bit of swearing.” He grinned, wiping his hands. “Miguel, grab the generator. I’ll get the lights re-routed to the backup circuit at the panel.”

Five minutes later, as the last chords of “What a Wonderful World” faded, the banyan tree flickered once, twice, and then blazed back to life, even brighter than before. A collective “Ahh” rose from the dance floor. Bianca, swaying with her father, glanced up and beamed.
Elara stood in the shadows, her heart pounding from the averted disaster. She watched Kai at the breaker panel, explaining something to Miguel with easy gestures. He’d known about the rusty lock. He’d known a trick to open it. He’d known where the backup circuit was. This wasn’t charm. This was competence. A deep, practical, local competence that she, for all her binders and schedules, simply did not possess. The realization was as unsettling as it was impressive.
As the night deepened and the band switched to something slow and soulful, Bianca floated over, her earlier fury replaced by a champagne-induced glow. She clasped both Elara’s and Kai’s hands, having smoothly commandeered him the moment the music started.
“You two,” she sighed, her eyes misty. “You’ve been so wonderful. And the way you look at each other… when you think the other isn’t looking.” She squeezed their hands. “It’s so rare. You can’t fake that. It’s the real thing.”

The words landed between them like a live wire. Elara jolt straight to her sternum. Kai’s easy smile stiffened.
“We should dance,” he replied abruptly, his voice a little rough. “Maintain the ruse, right?”

Before she could protest, he was leading her to the edge of the dance floor, under the dappled light of the banyan tree. He took her right hand in his left, his other hand coming to rest, warm and firm, on the small of her back. The touch seared through the thin silk of her blouse. Theto move, a simple, slow box step.
It was the first time they’d truly touched beyond a handshake or a stiff, photo-op arm around the shoulders. His hand was calloused, a surfer’s hand, contradicting his laid-back persona. He held her with a certainty that left no room for stumble, his frame solid and real against the soft night air. She caught the scent of him—salt air, sun-warmed skin, and something uniquely, indefinably Kai—overriding the perfume of plumeria and champagne.
“You saved the day,” she said, her voice quieter than she intended. “Twice.”

“Just earning my keep,” he murmured, his gaze fixed somewhere over her shoulder. But his thumb moved, a tiny, unconscious stroke against the fabric on her back.
The world narrowed to the space between them. The laughter of guests, the clink of glasses, the melody of the band—it all faded into a distant hum. All she was aware of was the heat of his palm, the solid wall of his chest, the slight scratch of his cotton shirt against her cheek when she accidentally leaned too close. It was unsettlingly, profoundly pleasant. A deep, slow warmth unspooled in her stomach, a sensation that had nothing to do with partnership agreements and everything to do with the man holding her.
The song ended too soon, and another, more upbeat one began. They sprang apart as if electrocuted. The space between them cold.
The rest of the reception passed in a blur. They played their parts, smiling, touching arms briefly for the guests, but the easy banter was gone, replaced by a charged, humming silence. They packed up, oversaw the cleanup, and finally climbed into Elara’s sensible SUV for the short drive back to the cottage they now shared.
The interior of the car was a vault of quiet. The only sounds were the crunch of gravel and the distant, rhythmic sigh of the ocean. Bianca’s words echoed in the space between them, mingling with the memory of his hand on her back, the look in his eyes when the lock gave way.
Elara gripped the steering wheel, staring straight ahead at the moon-washed road. She could feel Kai looking out his window, his profile a sharp, thoughtful cut against the glass.
You can’t fake that. It’s the real thing.
The lie, it seemed, was getting uncomfortably good at pretending to be the truth. And the worst part—the truly terrifying hook that sank deep into her gut as she pulled into their driveway—was that for a moment under those fairy lights, with his calloused hand in hers, she hadn’t been entirely sure it was a lie at all.
