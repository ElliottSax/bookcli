Chapter 3: I Now Pronounce You Stressed

Industrial lemon cleaner and existential dread permeated the Clatsop County Courthouse. Perched on a wooden bench polished smooth by a century of nervous fidgeting, Elara clutched her bouquet—a last-minute, slightly sad trio of white carnations from the gas station—and tried to remember how to breathe.

“You look,” Kai said, dropping onto the bench beside her, “like you’re about to be sentenced, not wed.”

Dark trousers and a simple, well-fitting linen shirt, sleeves rolled to his elbows, clothed an infuriatingly at ease man. He might have been waiting for a table at a seafood shack, not the legal binding of their futures.

“There are similarities,” Elara muttered, checking her watch. “The sentencing might be shorter.”

Against the beige wall stood their witnesses: a bored-looking court clerk named Daryl and a woman named Brenda trying to file a noise complaint about her neighbor’s rooster. Recruited with the promise of fifty dollars each, they radiated a palpable desire to be anywhere else.

“Elara Finch and Kai Lawson?” A bailiff poked his head out of a door. “Judge Hernandez is ready for you.”

Less a chapel and more a spare office with a fake ficus tree in the corner, the ceremony room housed Judge Hernandez. The woman with kind eyes and a no-nonsense bun gave them a practiced, weary smile.

“Ready to make it official?” she asked, opening a binder.

Elara’s throat closed. This was it. The point of no return. A cold sweat prickled at the base of her spine. She’d orchestrated hundreds of weddings—twinkling lights, soaring violins, tears of joy. This was the transactional underbelly of the industry, and it was horrifying.

Kai’s hand brushed against hers. Not a hold, just a fleeting, warm contact. A quick, sideways grin that didn’t reach his eyes met her glance. He was nervous, too. The realization offered a small, strange comfort.

The judge began the standard script. Elara heard the words as if from a great distance: …join together in matrimony… solemn vow… lawful wedded…

When it was time for the vows, Judge Hernandez prompted, “Do you have your own, or shall we proceed with the standard legal affirmation?”

“Standard,” Elara said, at the same time Kai said, “We’ve got something.”

Pure panic shot from her eyes. *What are you doing?*

He ignored her, turning to face her fully. His expression was unreadable, a mix of his usual laid-back charm and something more focused. Warm, slightly calloused hands took hers.

“Elara,” he began, his voice low but clear in the quiet room. “I vow to be your partner in this… unique venture. To respect the terms of our agreement, section and clause.” A faint smirk appeared. “To not use your good scissors to open bags of surf wax. And…” He paused, his thumb stroking a faint, absent circle on her knuckle. An unwelcome shiver traveled up her arm. “To always share my sunscreen on the beach, because I know you’ll forget yours, and watching you turn the color of a cooked lobster would be bad for our unified front.”

Daryl the clerk snorted. Brenda sighed, possibly thinking of the rooster.

Elara stared at him. The absurdity of it—the sunscreen vow, delivered with such faux solemnity—punctured the balloon of anxiety in her chest. A thin, startled laugh escaped. “That’s… oddly specific.”

“Your turn,” he murmured, eyes glinting.

She swallowed, her mind blank of anything but their thirty-seven-page contract. “Kai. I vow to uphold the mutually beneficial parameters of our arrangement. To water your sad succulent on the windowsill when you’re away. And…” She grasped for something, anything, to match his tone. “To never deliberately schedule a loud event on a morning when you’ve had a late surf session. Probably.”

Judge Hernandez’s lips twitched. “I’ve heard worse. The rings?”

Fumbling commenced with the simple silver bands—purchased yesterday from a tourist shop, still smelling of polish. His finger remained surprisingly steady as he slid the ring onto hers. It felt foreign and heavy. Trembling hands placed his ring.

“By the power vested in me by the State of Oregon,” Judge Hernandez intoned, “I now pronounce you married. You may… seal the agreement.”

They both froze. The kiss. They hadn’t discussed the kiss. It wasn’t in the contract. Elara’s brain short-circuited, running through a flowchart of options: perfunctory cheek (too distant), full kiss (absolutely not), a hug (bizarre).

Kai solved it. Leaning in, his hand cradled her jaw, his thumb resting just below her ear. Warm breath brushed her skin. “For the witnesses,” he whispered, so only she could hear. Then he pressed a firm, closed-mouth kiss to her other cheek. It lasted exactly two seconds. Polite, friendly, and utterly devoid of romance, it also sent a completely illogical, electric jolt down her neck.

He pulled back. “Congratulations, Mrs. Lawson,” he said, the name sounding utterly surreal.

“Thank you, Mr. Finch,” she retorted automatically, then flushed. “I mean—Lawson. You’re Kai Lawson.”

“And you’re stuck with me,” he said, that easy grin back in place. “For twelve months, anyway.”

Signatures were scrawled on the license with Daryl and Brenda as witnesses. Elara’s looked spidery and unfamiliar. Kai’s was a relaxed scrawl. Payment changed hands, and their witnesses vanished quickly, richer and possibly more cynical.

Stepping out of the courthouse into the brisk coastal afternoon felt like emerging from a submarine. Salty, real air filled her lungs with a deep, shuddering inhalation.

“Well,” Kai said, squinting in the sunlight. “That was—”

“Elara? Elara Finch, is that you?”

A melodic chirp laced with razor-sharp curiosity cut through the air. Margo Bell, owner of ‘Seaside Charms,’ the town’s most prolific boutique and gossip hub, bore down on them, a vision in flowing lavender and inquisitive delight. Her eyes zeroed in on Elara’s left hand, then Kai’s, then the pathetic gas station carnations.

“Margo,” Elara said, forcing a smile that felt like a grimace. “Hello.”

“And Kai Lawson!” Margo’s gaze danced between them, putting it together with the speed of a supercomputer. “My, my. What brings you two to the courthouse on a Tuesday? Not… legal trouble?” Her tone hoped for it.

Kai slung an arm around Elara’s shoulders, pulling her into his side. It was a casual, possessive move that made her bones lock. “No trouble, Margo. Just making an honest woman out of her.”

Elara elbowed him subtly in the ribs. He didn’t even flinch.

Margo’s perfectly penciled eyebrows shot into her silver bangs. “You’re married? But… when? How? I hadn’t heard a peep! No engagement party, no bridal shower…” She looked genuinely pained by the social oversight.

“Just now,” Kai said, his voice a warm, confiding rumble. “We’re private people. Wanted it to be about us, you know?” He looked down at Elara with a gaze so convincingly tender she almost believed it herself. “Couldn’t wait.”

Elara found her voice, leaning into the fiction and into his side. The solid warmth of him was disconcerting. “It was a whirlwind,” she said, aiming for breathless and landing somewhere near asthmatic. “When you know, you know.”

Margo’s eyes were shining with the glee of being First Knower. “A secret courthouse wedding! How wildly romantic! But you must let me throw you a little celebration dinner. The town will be stunned.”

“We’re laying low for a bit,” Kai said smoothly, giving Elara’s shoulder a squeeze. “Honeymoon phase. But we’ll be around. You’ll be the first we tell all the details to, Margo. Promise.”

He extricated them with the skill of a politician, steering Elara toward his beat-up Jeep. Only when they were inside, the doors shut against the world, did the performative ease vanish. He dropped his head back against the seat with a long exhale.

“Holy shit,” he said.

“You kissed my cheek,” Elara accused, her own heart still hammering.

“You called me Mr. Finch.”

“You told Margo we were in a honeymoon phase!”

“And you leaned into it like a pro.” He started the engine, a wry smile on his face. “We’re a good team, Finch. Terrible at marriage, but great at deception.”

They drove to a quiet pub overlooking the harbor for a subdued, post-nuptial dinner. It was time for boot camp.

“Okay,” Elara said, spreading a notebook on the sticky table between their fish and chips. “The story. We met when I arrived to assess the inn.”

“Disagree,” Kai said, stealing one of her fries. “Too boring. We met on the beach. You were trying to drag a piece of driftwood twice your size back to the inn for ‘decor,’ and I offered to help. You refused. It was very stubborn and cute.”

“It’s not cute, it’s inefficient. And we didn’t.”

“We do now.” He pointed a fry at her. “The beach meeting shows shared geography, my helpful nature, your adorable stubbornness. It’s foundational.”

She scowled but wrote it down. “Fine. Beach. Then what? We didn’t start dating immediately.”

“No, we circled each other. I’d bring you coffee when I saw you working late at the inn. You’d leave me muffins from that bakery you like.”

“I don’t like muffins that much.”

“You do in this story. They were blueberry. It’s important.”

She scribbled. Blueberry muffins, a peace offering. “The proposal. It has to be simple. Not flashy. You’re not flashy.”

“Says the woman with a color-coded renovation timeline. I proposed on my boat. During sunset. No ring, just… asked.”

Elara paused, her pen hovering. The image was unexpectedly potent: Kai, silhouetted against a dying sun, asking a question that meant nothing. She shook it off. “Too romantic. It’ll make people sigh. We want them to believe it, not swoon.”

“People need to swoon a little to believe it, Finch. Otherwise, we just look like two people who got married for tax reasons.” He leaned forward, his voice dropping. “We had a moment. On the boat. The water was calm, the sky was on fire, and it just felt… right. That’s our story. You looked at me, for once without a spreadsheet in your head, and said yes.”

Their eyes locked over the table. The pub noise faded—the clatter of plates, the murmur of other conversations. For a second, the fiction felt porous, a thin veil over something they were both pretending wasn’t there. The warmth of his hand on her cheek in the courthouse. The scent of salt and soap on his skin now.

Elara looked down first, her cheeks hot. “Fine. Sunset boat proposal. But we keep the courthouse wedding. It fits the narrative of us being private, unconventional.”

“Deal.” He sat back, the intensity gone, replaced by that familiar, lazy smile. “See? We’re already writing our greatest hit.”

Moving her things into the Sea Sprite Inn that evening was a surreal exercise in compartmentalization. The grand, slightly shabby master suite, with its vaulted ceiling, bay window overlooking the churning Pacific, and her aunt’s massive four-poster bed, was now hers. She unpacked her suitcases, hanging her crisp, organized clothes in the antique wardrobe, lining her books on the shelf by genre and height. She placed her laptop on the writing desk, precisely angled.

Kai carried the last box up for her, setting it inside the door. He looked around the room, at her careful order imposed on the space. “Very you,” he said.

“Where’s your stuff?” she asked.

He hooked a thumb toward the ceiling. “The loft apartment above the garage. It’s renovated, has its own entrance. More my speed. And it’s in the contract—separate residences under one roof.” He gave her a two-fingered salute. “I’ll be just upstairs if you need anything. To fix a leak, or… you know, pretend to be in love with you on short notice.”

And then he was gone, his footsteps echoing down the main staircase.

The silence of the old inn settled around her, thick and heavy. It was a different silence than her quiet apartment in Portland. This was a living silence, full of the groans of settling wood, the distant crash of waves, and the profound absence of her aunt. Elara sat on the edge of the giant bed, her hands resting on the quilt her aunt had stitched. The wedding band glinted, a cold, metallic lie against her skin.

She went through the motions: a shower, pajamas, checking her email. Every tick of the grandfather clock in the hallway below echoed through the floorboards.

It was past eleven when she heard it. A low rumble of laughter, warm and rich, drifting up through the house. Kai was downstairs, probably in the inn’s cozy kitchen. On a phone call. His voice was a murmur she couldn’t decipher, but the laughter was clear—uninhibited, joyful, real*. It was the laugh he’d never quite given her, not fully. It was for someone else.

Elara found herself holding her breath, listening. A pang, sharp and unexpected, struck her right beneath the sternum. It wasn’t jealousy—that would be ridiculous. They had a contract. This was loneliness. The deep, echoing kind that comes from being in a cavernous space, legally bound to another person, yet utterly alone. She was surrounded by the ghost of her family and the living, breathing presence of a stranger she’d married, whose real laughter was a sound for other people.

The call ended. She heard the soft click of a door, his footsteps on the back stairs leading to the loft. Then, silence again.

She slid under the cold sheets of the massive bed, the weight of the day pressing down on her. She’d gotten what she wanted: the inn was hers, the clause was satisfied. But as she lay there, staring at the moonlit ceiling, the ring a heavy reminder on her finger, Elara realized with a sinking clarity that the hardest part wasn’t the lie they’d told Margo, or the story they’d crafted over dinner.

The hardest part was the silence after the performance ended. The hollow space where the fiction stopped and the reality of her chosen solitude began, punctuated only by the sound of her temporary husband’s genuine laughter, echoing from another room.
