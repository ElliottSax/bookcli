Chapter 6: Contract Breaches

Chapter 6: Contract Breaches

The problem with inheriting a fortune, Elara decided, was the people who came attached to it. Specifically, people like Bartholomew Finch.
Finch stood in the foyer of The Mariposa Inn (a historic, slightly worn bed-and-breakfast) like a Victorian ghost who disapproved of the wallpaper. He was a tall, reedy man in a suit that appeared to sigh with regret, his face a monument to stoic disappointment. He was the executor of Aunt Clara’s will, and his arrival, announced by nothing more than a single, precise knock, felt like an audit.
“Mr. Finch,” Elara said, her voice bright with a hospitality she did not feel. “What an unexpected… pleasure.”

“Mrs. Thorne,” Finch intoned, his eyes—the colour of weak tea—sweeping over her, then the lobby. “I was in the vicinity. Thought I’d perform a preliminary wellness check on the… marital asset.”

Elara’s smile tightened. Marital asset. As if her heart were a stock portfolio.
“Kai’s just out back,” she said, leading the way. “We were just about to have lunch.”

She found Kai on the sun-drenched patio, attempting to fix a wobbly table leg with a butter knife and what was sheer optimism. He was shirtless, a fact thato hit Finch like a physical blow. The lawyer blinked, slowly, as if trying to clear an unsightly mirage.
“Darling,” Elara chirped, the endearment like a foreign object in her mouth. “Look who’s here.”

Kai looked up, his eyes meeting hers with a flash of understanding. He didn’t miss a beat. “Bart! You didn’t tell us you were coming. I’d have put on the good cufflinks.” He rose, wiping his hands on his paint-splattered shorts, and extended one. Finch looked at the offered hand as if it might be booby-trapped.
“The terms of the late Mrs. Thorne’s will are quite specific about the legitimacy of the union,” Finch replied, ignoring Kai’s hand. “A twelve-month period of bona fide cohabitation. My visit is to ensure there’s no… contractual breach.”

“Breach?” Kai slid an arm around Elara’s waist, his palm warm and slightly rough against her side. She stiffened, then melted into the touch, a performance she hoped glanced more like affection than a seizure. “Not a chance. We’re breached out. I mean, breach-less. We’re utterly committed. Aren’t we, snookums?”

“Desperately,” Elara breathed, leaning her head against Kai’s shoulder. He smelled of salt air, sawdust, and sunshine. It was distractingly pleasant.
Finch’s gaze was a laser level, searching for crookedness. “Hmm. I’d like to observe your dynamic in a more… social setting. A joint activity, perhaps.”

Kai’s fingers gave her waist a subtle squeeze. “Well, you’re in luck. We were simply about to head out for our weekly romantic beach picnic. Weren’t we, sweet pea?”

“Our absolute favourite,” Elara said, her jaw beginning to ache from smiling. “Just us, the waves, and a slightly alarming amount of seagulls.”

“I shall accompany you,” Finch stated. It was not a question.
The picnic was a masterpiece of forced affection, laid out on a red-checkered blanket that screamed ‘stage prop’. Elara had packed a basket with military precision: artisanal cheeses, crusty bread, strawberries that gleamed like jewels. Kai had added a bag of suspiciously bright orange cheese puffs and two lukewarm beers he’d pulled from the back of the fridge.
“Your choice of beverage is… informal,” Finch noted, perched on a folding camp stool he’d produced from his car like a magician producing a rabbit of despair.
“Keeps me grounded, Bart,” K answered, popping a cheese puff and offering one to Elara. “Can’t get too fancy for my girl, here.”

Elara took the puff, her smile brittle. She took a delicate bite, and a cloud of orange dust poofed onto her chin. Kai, with a look of exaggerated tenderness, reached over and wiped it away with his thumb. The touch sent a tiny, unwelcome spark down her spine.
“You’re such a mess,” he murmured, his voice low and playfully chiding for Finch’s benefit. But his eyes held hers, and for a second, the joke faded into something else.
“Only for you,” she whispered back, the script feeling thin.
They fed each other strawberries. Kai’s fingers brushed her lips, and she flush that had nothing to do with the sun. He regaled a stone-faced Finch with the entirely fabricated story of their first date—a disastrous mini-golf outing where, according to Kai, Elara had cheated spectacularly at the windmill hole.
“She’s fiercely competitive,” Kai said, grinning. “It’s terrifying. And hot.”

“It was not cheating,” Elara retorted, falling into the rhythm of the banter. “The ball clearly ricocheted off the clown’s nose according to the laws of physics.”

“You blew on it!”

“That was a coastal breeze!”

They bickered, light and easy, and for a flicker, it didn’t feel like a performance. Then Elara caught Finch’s unmoved expression and remembered. She leaned in, planting a quick, loud kiss on Kai’s cheek. “You love it.”

“I dmurmuredhe said, and the words, meant to be airy, landed with a strange weight.
Finch finally stood, brushing non-existent sand from his trousers. “I have seen enough for today. I will return in one month for a more extended evaluation. Good day.”

They watched in silence as he marched across the dunes, a black silhouette against the bright sky, until he disappeared.
The moment he was gone, the charisma evaporated from Kai like steam. He dropped his head into his hands. “Oh my god. I feel like merelyst did community service for my soul.”

Elara let out a long, shaky breath, the performance adrenaline draining away and leaving her hollow. “A ‘wellness check’? He looked at us like we were a tax return with questionable deductions.”

“The cheese puff thing was a mistake,” Kai groaned. “I could see his soul leaving his body.”

“It was! Why would you bring those? This was a high-stakes operation!”

“Because I like them!” Kai shot back, standing up and pacing. “And maybe because this whole thing is so suffocatingly perfect, Elara. The perfect basket, the perfect blanket, the perfectly sliced goddamn grapes. It’s like being married to a Pinterest board with a spreadsheet.”

The words stung, sharp and accurate. “Well, not all of us can just skate through life on vibes and cheese dust, Kai! Some of us have to actually try. Some of us have something to lose!”

He stopped pacing. The ocean roared beside them, a steady, rushing counterpoint to their silence. “What do you have to lose, Elara?”

“Everything!” The word burst out of her, raw and unscripted. “This inn, my business, the only stable object I’ve ever built! If I fail at this—if we fail at this—I’m onlyjust losing a house. I’m proving every single person who ever thought I was too rigid, too uptight, too much right. Failure isn’t an option. It’s a death sentence.”

She was breathing heavily, shocked at her own outburst. Kai justgazedd at her, his usual levity gone, replaced by a deep, unsettling focus.
“And you think I have nothing to lose?” he asked, his voice quiet.
“You have a van and a surfboard! You’re allergic to commitment! You told the florist last week that your life philosophy was ‘rolling stones gather no mortgages’!”

A faint smile touched his lips, but it was sad. “Yeah. Because stones that roll can’t be tied down. Can’t be left behind. Can’t watch something they love crumble because they weren’t enough to hold it together.” He looked out at the sea. “My dad was a rolling stone. He’d promise to stay, build us a treehouse, teach me to sail. He’d get the wood, even start nailing. Then one morning, he’d just be gone. No note. The half-built treehouse wosimplyjust sit there, rotting in the rain. A monument to ‘almost’.”

The confession hung between them, fragile as sea foam. Elara’s anger deflated, leaving a pang of understanding in its place. She saw it then—the constant motion, the refusal to be pinned down, wasn’t just freedom. It was a pre-emptive strike.
“I’m not building a treehouse, Kai,” she said softly.
“Aren’t you?” He met her eyes. “This inn. This marriage. It’merelyl just… wood and promises.”

They stood there, the masks gone, the contract forgotten. The realest thing they’d ever shared was their fear.
Kai broke the tension with a slow nod toward the water. A few surfers were riding the gentle, rolling waves. “Come on.”

“What? No.”

“You’re wound tighter than a watch. You need to get in the water. I’ll teach you to surf.”

“I don’t want to learn to surf. Surfing is for people who think ‘wipeout’ is a fun outcome.”

“It’s the perfect activity fwhispereds,” he said, a ghost of his old grin returning. “It involves a lot of falling down, getting back up, and pretending you meant to do it. Very on-brand.”

Against her every instinct, she followed him. He rented a long, soft-top board, leading her into the shallows. The Pacific was bracingly cold, shocking the breath from her lungs.
“Okay, first lesson: how to lie on the board,” he said, all business now. He guided her onto the foam, positioning her body with hands that were clinical and gentle. “Arch your back a little. Chin up. You’re a sea otter, not a dead starfish.”

She clung to the board, the world reduced to the slap of water, the taste of salt, and the steady sound of his voice behind her. He was patient, correcting her stance without condescension, his instructions clear and calm.
“Now, when you feel the wave lift you, you pop up. All in one motion. Don’t think. Just move.”

He pushed her into a tiny wave. She scrambled, knees and elbows, and flopped into the water with a spectacular splash. She came up spluttering.
“I told you!”

“That wastatedinking,” he said, laughing, pulling her board back. “TryOnlyin. Just feel it.”

The next time, she surge of the water, the board becoming light. For a split second, she forgot to be afraid. She pushed up, found her feet, and was standing, wobbling wildly, arms windmilling—but standing. The shore rushed toward her, a blur of colour and sound.
She rode it all the way until the board slowed in the shallows, then jumped off, stumbling. Kai was right there, catching her before she fell. She was laughing, breathless, her heart hammering against her ribs from more than just exertion.
“I did it!”
“You did!” He was beaming, his hair plastered to his forehead, his eyes crinkled at the corners. He held her upper arms, steadying her. “You’re a natural!”

In that moment, soaked and triumphant, with his hands on her and his pride for her shining in his face, the last wall crumbled. The air between them crackled, charged with the salt and the success and the startling intimacy of shared vulnerability.
And then she saw him. Finch. Standing on the boardwalk, a notepad in his hand, watching them.
The spell shattered, but the charge remained. They needed a finale.
“He’s back,” she whispered, her laughter dying.
Kai’s eyes flicked to the boardwalk, then back to her. His expression shifted, the warmth hardening into resolve. “Sell it.”

He didn’t give her time to prepare. One hand slid from her arm to the small of her back, the other cupped her jaw. His touch was nosimplyger just a performance. It was a question.
And her answer was to rise onto her toes.
The kiss was meant to be a brush of lips, a convincing peck for their audience. It was not.
It was salt and surprise and warmth. It was the shock of his mouth, softer than she imagined, moving against hers with a purpose that stole the breath from her lungs. Her hands, of their own volition, fisted in the wet fabric of his t-shirt. He made a low sound in his throat, and his arm tightened around her, pulling her flush against him. The world narrowed to the feel of the sun on her closed eyelids, the cold water on her legs, the devastating heat of him everywhere else. It was not careful. It was not contractual. It was a breach of every unspoken rule they had.
When he pulled away, it was gradual. Their foreheads rested together, their breaths mingling, ragged. His eyes searched hers, wide with the same stunned confusion she felt.
Finch, satisfied, gave a curt nod from the boardwalk and turned away.
Kai released her as if she’d burned him. They waded to shore in a silence thicker than the ocean fog, the ghost of the kiss hanging between them, a new clause added to their agreement in invisible, incendiary ink.
That night, the inn was quiet, filled only with the echo of the sea and the memory of his mouth on hers. Elara moved through her meticulous pre-bed routine—skincare, tomorrow’s to-do list, checking the locks—but her mind was a riot.
She walked into her bedroom and saw it draped over the reading chair: Kai’s grey hoodie, forgotten from days ago. It was soft, worn thin in places, smelling irrevocably of him—that mix of clean cotton, ocean, and the faint, warm scent of his skin.
She picked it up. It was a terrible idea. A boundary crossed. A thread pulled that could unravel everything.
But the silence was too loud, and the memory of the kiss was a cold brand on her lips, and she was so, so tired of being careful.
Elara slipped off her sensible silk robe. She pulled the hoodie over her head. The fabric was enormous, swallowing her, the cuffs falling past her fingertips. She hugged herself, burying her nose in the collar, and his scent enveloped her completely. It was a warmth that had nothing to do with fabric. It was a confession in the dark, a silent breach of their contract that, for tonight, she had no desire to correct.
