Chapter 3: I Now Pronounce You Stressed

Industrial lemon cleaner and existential dread permeated the Clatsop County Courthouse. Perched on a wooden bench polished smooth by a century of nervous fidgeting, Elara clutched her bouquet—a last-minute, slightly sad trio of white carnations from the gas station—and tried to remember how to breathe. The faint scent of disinfectant and stale air clung to her like a bad omen. Desperation, a desperate attempt to hold back the tide of time, seemed baked into the courthouse's very walls.
“You look,” Kai said, dropping onto the bench beside her, “like you’re about to be sentenced, not wed.” His voice offered a gentle counterpoint to the cacophony of anxiety that had taken up residence in her chest. Dark trousers and a simple, well-fitting linen shirt, sleeves rolled to his elbows, clothed an infuriatingly at ease man. He might have been waiting for a table at a seafood shack, not the legal binding of their futures.
In the courthouse's dim light, long shadows accentuated the sharp angles of Kai's face. His deep, piercing blue eyes appeared to bore into her very soul, searching for any sign of weakness. A shiver ran down her spine as their gazes met, a spark of electricity leaving her breathless.
“There are similarities,” Elara muttered, checking her watch. The ticking of the clock mocked her, a constant reminder that time was running out. “The sentencing might be shorter.”

Against the beige wall stood their witnesses: a bored-looking court clerk named Daryl and a woman named Brenda trying to file a noise complaint about her neighbor’s rooster. Recruited with the promise of fifty dollars each, they radiated a palpable desire to be anywhere else. Stale coffee and the distant tang of the ocean thickened the air.
“Elara Finch and Kai Lawson?” A bailiff poked his head out of a door. “Judge Hernandez is ready for you.” His low, gravelly growl sent another shiver down Elara's spine.
Less a chapel and more a spare office with a fake ficus tree in the corner, the ceremony room housed Judge Hernandez. The woman with kind eyes and a no-nonsense bun gave them a practiced, weary smile. Her deep, warm brown eyes held a world of wisdom, a quiet understanding of the complexities of human relationships.
“Ready to make it official?” she asked, opening a binder. The rustling pages sighed, a gentle reminder that this was the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.
Elara’s throat closed. This was it. The point of no return. A cold sweat prickled at the base of her spine. She’d orchestrated hundreds of weddings—twinkling lights, soaring violins, tears of joy. This was the transactional underbelly of the industry, and it was horrifying. Her stomach twisted into knots.
Kai’s hand brushed against hers. Not a hold, just a fleeting, warm contact. A quick, sideways grin that didn’t reach his eyes met her glance. He was nervous, too. The realization offered a small, strange comfort. A pang of guilt twisted inside her, feelings of responsibility for putting him in this situation.
The judge began the standard script. Elara heard the words as if from a great distance: …join together in matrimony… solemn vow… lawful wedded… Her own voice sounded like a distant echo, a reminder that she was still a participant in this farce.
When it was time for the vows, Judge Hernandez prompted, “Do you have your own, or shall we proceed with the standard legal affirmation?”

“Standard,” Elara said, at the same time Kai replied, “We’ve got something.” The words hung in the air, a challenge, a dare. A surge of panic tightened her chest. What were they getting themselves into?
He ignored her, turning to face her fully. His expression was unreadable, a mix of his usual laid-back charm and something more focused. Warm, slightly calloused hands took hers. The touch sent a jolt of electricity through her body, a spark of connection that left her breathless.
“Elara,” he began, his voice low but clear in the quiet room. “I vow to be your partner in this… unique venture. To respect the terms of our agreement, section and clause.” A faint smirk appeared. “To not use your good scissors to open bags of surf wax. And…” He paused, his thumb stroking a faint, absent circle on her knuckle. An unwelcome shiver traveled up her arm. “To always share my sunscreen on the beach, because I know you’ll forget yours, and watching you turn the color of a cooked lobster would be bad for our unified front.”

Daryl the clerk snorted. Brenda sighed, possibly thinking of the rooster. Their reactions were a distant hum, a reminder that this was just a normal day, a normal wedding.
Elara stared at him. The absurdity of it—the sunscreen vow, delivered with such faux solemnity—punctured the balloon of anxiety in her chest. A thin, startled laugh escaped. “That’s… oddly specific.”

“Your turn,” he murmured, eyes glinting. The spark of connection between theto grow, a flame that burned brighter with every passing moment.
She swallowed, her mind blank of anything but their thirty-seven-page contract. “Kai. I vow to uphold the mutually beneficial parameters of our arrangement. To water your sad succulent on the windowsill when you’re away. And…” She grasped for something, anything, to match his tone. “To never deliberately schedule a loud event on a morning when you’ve had a late surf session. Probably.”

Judge Hernandez’s lips twitched. “I’ve heard worse. The rings?”

Fumbling commenced with the simple silver bands—purchased yesterday from a tourist shop, still smelling of polish. His finger remained surprisingly steady as he slid the ring onto hers. It foreign and heavy. With trembling hands, she placed his ring. The metal clicked into place like a bell, a they were really doing this.
“By the power vested in me by the State of Oregon,” Judge Hernandez intoned, “I now pronounce you married. You may… seal the agreement.”

They both froze. The kiss. They hadn’t discussed the kiss. It wasn’t in the contract. Elara’s brain short-circuited, running through a flowchart of options: perfunctory cheek (too distant), full kiss (absolutely not), a hug (bizarre).
Kai solved it. Leaning in, his hand cradled her jaw, his thumb resting simply below her ear. Warm breath brushed her skin. “For the witnesses,” he whispered, so only she could hear. Then he pressed a firm, closed-mouth kiss to her other cheek. It lasted exactly two seconds. Polite, friendly, and utterly devoid of romance, it also sent a completely illogical, electric jolt down her neck.
He pulled back. “Congratulations, Mrs. Lawson,” he said, the name sounding utterly surreal. Elara pang of discomfort,hints off disconnection. She was no longer Elara Finch, but Mrs. Lawson, a name that like a stranger's.
“Thank you, Mr. Finch,” she retorted automatically, then flushed. “I mean—Lawson. You’re Kai Lawson.”

“And you’re stuck with me,” answeredaid, that easy grin back in place. “For twelve months, anyway.”

Signatures were scrawled on the license with Daryl and Brenda as witnesses. Elara’s looked spidery and unfamiliar. Kai’s was a relaxed scrawl. Payment changed hands, and their witnesses vanished quickly, richer and possibly more cynical.
Stepping out of the courthouse into the brisk coastal afternoon like emerging from a submarine. Salty, real air filled her lungs with a deep, shuddering inhalation. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was like music, a soothing melody that calmed her frazzled nerves.
“Well,” Kai said, squinting in the sunlight. “That was—”

“Elara? Elara Finch, is that you?”

A melodic chirp laced with razor-sharp curiosity cut through the air. Margo Bell, owner of ‘Seaside Charms,’ the town’s most prolific boutique and gossip hub, bore down on them, a vision in flowing lavender and inquisitive delight. Her eyes zeroed in on Elara’s left hand, then Kai’s, then the pathetic gas station carnations.
“Margo,”murmuredra said, forcing a smile that like a mask. The sound of her own voice was a distant echo, a reminder that she was still a part of this, that she was still a participant in this farce.
Margo's eyes sparkled with curiosity. “I heard it was a beautiful ceremony. I'm so glad you could make it, Elara. And Kai, dear, you look dashing as ever.” Her gaze lingered on Kai's face, a hint of something more, something that Elara couldn't quite decipher.
Kai's expression remained neutral, but Elara detected a flicker of something, a spark of attraction that seemed to in his eyes. She pang of discomfort, adisconnection. This was not what she had expected, not what she had planned.
As they walked away from the courthouse, the sound of the waves grew louder, a soothing melody that calmed her frazzled nerves. Elara feelings oftion, a sense ofhints oftion from the world around her.
The sun beat down on them, its warm rays a reminder of the uncertain future that lay ahead. Elara t, a sense of uncertaintyfeelings of the future hold for them? What lay ahead in this strange, new chapter of their lives?
