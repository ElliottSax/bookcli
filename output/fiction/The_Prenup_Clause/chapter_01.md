## **Chapter 1: The Last Petal Falls**

Bob Marley tore the first petal from Elara Finch’s carefully planned day. In the sun-dappled garden of The Mariposa Inn, a white linen napkin was adjusted for the third time on a memorial service chair. The opening bass line of “Three Little Birds” thumped through the dense hibiscus hedge with the subtlety of a wrecking ball, and the silverware she was laying out gave a sympathetic shudder. A honeybee, drunk on lavender, wobbled mid-air as if the very soundwaves had disrupted its flight.
“Every little thing is *not* alright.” Elara stabbed a fork into place so firmly the table leg groaned. The linen was stiff and starched under her fingers, a tactile anchor in a morning already slipping its moorings.
Of course, the music came from next door. From Kai. The sonic signature of her childhood summers had been the whisper of the Pacific against the bluffs below the inn, the chitter of swallows, the rustle of Clara’s silk kimonos. This particular homecoming’s soundtrack was apparently reggae at an eardrum-vibrating volume, courtesy of the owner of Driftwood Surf School. A deep, centering breath filled her lungs with the scent of Aunt Clara’s prize roses—a deep, velvety crimson she’d cut that morning, their stems still weeping sap—and the salty, kelpy tang of the California coast. Beneath it all lingered the faint, persistent note of damp wood and peeling paint, the inn’s quiet sigh of neglect.
A masterpiece of controlled chaos, just like Clara, the garden sprawled before her. Wisteria dripped like lavender tears from the pergola where the service would be held. Hummingbirds, emerald and amethyst, dueled over feeders. It was perfect. Or it would be, if the air wasn’t also vibrating with the promise of *irie* vibes.
“He’ll stop.” She aligned a water glass precisely one inch from the plate’s edge, addressing the empty chair beside her. “He has to. It’s a memorial service. It’s *sacred*.” The words were brittle. The music pulsed on, a mocking, laid-back heartbeat. Her jaw tightened until a familiar ache bloomed at her temples. She built her life on foundations of color-coded spreadsheets and timelines that accounted for monsoon seasons in Mumbai, planning corporate galas for tech billionaires who cried less over server crashes than they did over the wrong shade of canapé. A loud neighbor was a variable. A loud, infuriatingly cheerful, and—according to the brief, disastrous encounter when she’d arrived yesterday—*devastatingly* good-looking neighbor was an act of God. And Elara did not believe in a deity that mischievous.
Yesterday, she’d marched over, clipboard in hand like a shield. Shirtless and waxing a surfboard in the dappled light of his ramshackle deck, his muscles moved with a disrespectful ease that redefined manual labor. Sunlight caught the water droplets clinging to the ridges of his spine.
“Do you think you could possibly keep it down?” Her voice was polished steel. “I’m trying to arrange a funeral.”

He looked up, his eyes the color of the sea after a storm, and wiped his hands on his board shorts. A slow, unrepentant grin spread across his face, carving a dimple she absolutely refused to acknowledge. “Elara Finch. Clipboard and all.” He’d remembered her name. From summers a decade ago, when she was a gawky teen with her nose in a book and he was the local surf prodigy, already effortlessly cool, trailing sand and laughter through the lobby. The recognition splashed like cold water down her back.
“Be that as it may,” she managed, tightening her grip on the laminate, “the sentiment currently includes a reading of Emily Dickinson, which does not pair well with bass drops.”

He laughed, a warm, rolling sound that appeared to emanate from the sun-bleached planks under his feet. “Fair enough. For Clara.” Leaning over, he turned the music down to a dull, apologetic throb. “But only for the Dickinson. She’s a downer. Clara would’ve preferred Whitman. ‘*I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.*’”

Now, as the clock ticked toward the 2 p.m. service, Bob Marley was still philosophizing. It was an act of war.
Once it began, the service became a beautiful, tear-streaked blur. The garden filled with the vibrant, eclectic crowd Clara had collected: artists with paint permanently etched under their nails, old fishermen with hands like gnarled driftwood, local shopkeepers smelling of sage and fresh bread, and a surprising number of people who justo be passing through and had decided to stay, captivated by the inn’s warm, lopsided embrace. Stories were told that made people laugh until they cried, and cry until they laughed, their voices weaving a tapestry more vivid than any eulogy. In her simple black dress, Elara structured dam around her grief begin to crack under the warmth of it all. She kept expecting to see Clara’s wild, silver-streaked hair bobbing through the crowd, handing out glasses of scandalously cheap champagne, her laughter a brighter chime than any wind chime.
Kai did attend. He stood at the very back, under the arch of fuchsia bougainvillea, wearing a clean, short-sleeved button-down that looked like it had been wrestled into submission. Quiet and respectful, he even glanced mildly pained during the Dickinson, his gaze fixed on a distant point on the horizon. A flicker of shame for her earlier irritation sparked—*See? He can be appropriate*—and was immediately extinguished when, during the final, held-breath moment of silence, the distant but unmistakable opening riff of “Buffalo Soldier” drifted from his property like a cheeky, melodic fart.
*Later,* her fingers curled into the black silk of her dress. *We will have words.*

Those words would have to wait for the reading of the will. Two hours later, Elara found herself in the sun-dappled garden and cluttered, cozy interiors of The Mariposa Inn. The air here was different—dust motes danced in slants of golden afternoon light, and it smelled of old paper, beeswax, and the faint, ghostly trace of Clara’s rosewater perfume. Mr. Henderson, Clara’s ancient, tortoise-like lawyer, sat behind a claw-footed desk, a handful of bemused beneficiaries arrayed before him like a strange bouquet—including the head librarian, who got Clara’s collection of vintage erotica (“For the restricted section, my dear!” Clara had apparently quipped), and the local stray cat population, now the beneficiaries of a sizable trust for gourmet tuna.
“And to my beloved niece, Elara Finch,” Mr. Henderson intoned, his spectacles perched on the end of his nose, the parchment crackling like autumn leaves in his hands, “I leave the heart of my world: The Mariposa Inn (a historic, slightly worn bed-and-breakfast), its land, and all its attendant charms and chaos.”

Elara’s breath caught. The room seemed appeared to the golden light softening the edges of every worn bookshelf and faded rug. The inn. The creaky floorboards she’d tiptoed over as a child, the window seat where she’d read countless novels, the kitchen that always smelled of cinnamon and possibility. *Hers.* A tangible piece of happiness, a sanctuary from the sterile, high-pressure world she’d built. Her eyes welled up, a pure, uncomplicated grief finally giving way to a surge of bittersweet joy.
“However,” Mr. Henderson continued, clearing his throat with a sound like gravel in a tin can. “There is a condition.”

A *condition*. Elara blinked, the tears receding. Conditions were her specialty. She could meet a condition. She could *exceed* a condition.
“Clara was a romantic, as we all know,” the lawyer said, a faint, wistful smile playing on his lips. “She believed in the enduring power of love, of stability, and of shared responsibility. As such, the full and unencumbered ownership of The Mariposa Inn is bequeathed to Elara… on the condition that she is legally and matrimonially wedded within one calendar year of the date of my passing.”

The silence was absolute, broken only by the cheerful, oblivious *tink* of a glass wind chime outside. Elara’s mind, usually a humming control room of activity, went white and silent.
“I’m sorry,” she said, her voice strangely calm, detached, as if listening to someone else speak from the end of a long tunnel. “It is bequeathed to me on the condition that I… *what*?”

“Married, dear,” Mr. Henderson repeated gently, as if explaining rain to a stone. “Twelve months. Three hundred and sixty-five days. Till death do you part, etcetera.”

A laugh bubbled up in Elara’s throat, sharp and disbelieving. “That’s… that’s insane. That’s a plot from a bad Regency novel. She can’t be serious. This isn’t a fairy tale, it’s a *deed*.”

“She was entirely serious. Clause 4B: The Matrimony Mandate. Her words.” He tapped the document. “If the condition is not met, the inn will be sold, and the proceeds will be divided among… ah, yes, the Sea Lion Rescue Center and a fund to provide free wetsuits for underprivileged children.”

Elara stared at him. She was being thwarted by sea lions and neoprene charity. The beautiful inheritance like a heavy, crumbling stone around her neck.
“There’s more,” Mr. Henderson replied, shuffling papers with deliberate slowness. “A financial disclosure. The Mariposa Inn, while beloved, is… financially delicate. Clara was better at making people feel at home than balancing ledgers. There is a significant mortgage in arrears, and the inspection report…” He slid a document toward her. The summary was a masterpiece of euphemistic doom. “The roof is, quote, ‘in a romantic relationship with the concept of gravity.’ The plumbing is ‘of historical interest.’ The electrical system ‘possesses a thrilling, unpredictable vitality.’ In short, my dear, it needs work. A great deal of work. A small fortune’s worth.”

The stone around her neck was now also on fire. A million-dollar problem wrapped in a matrimonial ultimatum. She was a planner, not a magician. You couldn’t Gantt-chart your way into a genuine marriage. And you certainly couldn’t fund a new roof with whimsy.
The next morning, armed with industrial-strength coffee that tasted of asphalt and feelings of impending doom, Elara retreated to The Salty Bean, the town’s hub of gossip and caffeine. She needed to think, to process, to build a spreadsheet in her mind where the columns didn’t keep collapsing. The café was a symphony of comforting sounds: the hiss of the steamer, the low murmur of retirees debating tides, the clatter of ceramic. She was on List Three (“Potential Roofers – Not Charmingly Incompetent”) when the bell above the door jingled with a particular, breezy violence.
Kai walked in.
He looked like he’d simply rolled out of the ocean and into his clothes—which, given the damp hair darkening the neck of his threadbare tee and the towel slung around his neck, he probably had. He moved with a loose-limbed grace that made the small space seem smaller, the air charged with the scent of salt, sunscreen, and cold Pacific. He didn’t see her, tucked in her corner booth like a shadow, and went straight to the counter where Marnie, the owner, was polishing espresso cups to a high shine.
“Marn,” he said, and his voice had lost all its usual easygoing melody. It was low, strained, the sound of a rope pulled taut. “Any word from the bank?”

Marnie’s kindly face fell, the wrinkles around her eyes deepening into trenches of sympathy. “Oh, honey. I heard. Denied?”

“Laughed out of the office would be more accurate.” Kai ran a hand through his dark, tousled hair, a gesture of pure frustration. “The buyout offer from Coastal Luxe Resorts expires at the end of the month. If I can’t get a loan to refinance, Driftwood is a memory. They’ll bulldoze it, put up some glass monstrosity with a ‘curated surf experience.’” answeredaid the last words like they tasted of bile.
“There’s no other way?” Marnie asked, her voice soft as the foam she was spooning.
“I’ve sold every board I can spare. I’m teaching lessons from dawn till dusk. It’s not enough. The land’s worth a fortune now. They want it.” He leaned on the counter, his broad shoulders slumping, the weight of it visibly pressing him down. “It was my dad’s place. Built it with his hands. It’s… it’s everything.”

Elara froze, her pen hovering over her notebook. She shouldn’t be listening. This was private, raw. This was the sound of a dream drowning. But she couldn’t move. His desperation was a mirror, reflecting her own.
“I just need a lifeline,” Kai murmured, more to himself than to Marnie, staring into the dark abyss of his coffee cup as if seeking answers. “A miracle. Or a extremely rich, very foolish spouse.” He tried to laugh, but it died in his throat, a hollow, broken sound.
Marnie reached over and patted his hand, her spotted skin against his sun-weathered knuckles. “Something will turn up, Kai. It has to.”

He nodded, a quick, jerky motion, thanked her for the coffee he didn’t order, and turned to leave. For a fleeting second, as he shouldered the door open, his stormy eyes swept across the room and met hers. There was no charm in his gaze now, no teasing glintMerelyst a hollowed-out worry that mirrored the cold stone sitting in her own stomach. A flicker of embarrassment crossed his face—he’d been overheard, his vulnerability exposed—then a shutter came down, and he was gone, the door jingling a mournful farewell behind him.
The door clicked shut. Elara sat perfectly still, the world reduced to a silent film beyond the glass. Her eyes fell not on her lists, but on the will she’d mentally projected onto the table. *Clause 4B: The Matrimony Mandate.*

Her gaze lifted, tracking Kai through the window as he slumped into the driver’s seat of his battered jeep, his head bowed not in thought, but in whatgazedd unmistakably like defeat. The solution, cold, flawless, and utterly clinical, clicked into place in her mind with the finality of a deadbolt. A transaction. His need for capital to save his land. Her need for a spouse to secure hers. A temporary, paper-only union. A business arrangement with a sunset clause. It was logical. It was clean.
But as his jeep’s engine coughed to life, the morning sun glinting on the windshield like a flash of interrogation light, a different document surfaced in her memory—not the will, but the loan papers he’d briefly, frantically shuffled at the counter. She’d caught a letterhead, a logo etched in minimalist, severe typeface she knew with the intimacy of a childhood scar. Sterling Consolidated.
The realization was a physical blow, a punch of ice to her diaphragm. Sterling wasn’t just any lender. It was her father’s company. The empire built on ruthless acquisitions, the reason she’d learned to build walls of spreadsheet and schedule, the source of the fortune that had always more like a cage.
Kai wasonlyjust desperate. He was ensnared in a trap set by her own family’s machine. Coastal Luxe Resorts was a Sterling subsidiary; she knew its predatory tactics. This wasn’t a simple business proposition anymore. It was a collision. To propose this marriage meant walking knowingly into the web her father had woven, using his own trap as her tool. She would be the spider, and the fly, all at once.
And if Kai discovered her connection to Sterling before the ink was dry on a marriage certificate… the lifeline she offered would snap, the alliance he desperately needed would look, feel, and *be*, a profound and personal betrayal. He would see not a partner, but a spy. A Finch, sent to finish what her father started.
The jeep vanished in a cloud of gold dust kicked up from the unpaved lot. Elara Finch, master planner, architect of flawless events, saw the perfect, logical path ahead, and for the first time in her carefully ordered life, understood with crystalline clarity that it was paved with thorns, and that at its end, she might bleed as much as he would.
