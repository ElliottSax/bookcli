  "plot_summary": "When Elara Finch returns to her late Aunt Clara's coastal inn to arrange the memorial service, she clashes immediately with the inn's next-door neighbor, the infuriatingly laid-back surf instructor Kai Rhodes, whose reggae music disrupts her meticulous planning. To her horror, she discovers Clara's will contains a bizarre 'prenup clause' for the inn: to inherit it fully, Elara must be married within a year. Desperate to save her aunt's legacy and seeing no other option, Elara proposes a marriage of convenience to Kai, who needs the stability of a guaranteed neighbor to secure a loan for his surf school. They draw up a detailed, emotionless contract. But as they navigate their fake relationship for the town, repair the aging inn, and confront their shared grief over Clara, their carefully written clauses begin to crumble. The list-maker and the free-spirit find their opposites attracting, moving from antagonism to partnership. When the original contract's term ends, they must choose between the safe, legal conclusion or dissolving the agreement to build a real, unwritten love on their own terms\u2014a choice that leads them to a heartfelt commitment, symbolized by a simple sea glass ring, and a future built not on fine print, but on genuine partnership.",
