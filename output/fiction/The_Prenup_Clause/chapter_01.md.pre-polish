Chapter 1: The Last Petal Falls

Chapter 1: The Last Petal Falls

The first petal of Elara Finch’s meticulously planned day was torn off by Bob Marley.

She was in the sun-dappled garden of The Mariposa Inn, adjusting a white linen napkin for the third time on a memorial service chair, when the opening bass line of “Three Little Birds” thumped through the hibiscus hedge with the subtlety of a wrecking ball. The silverware she was laying out gave a sympathetic little shudder.

“Every little thing is not alright,” Elara muttered, stabbing a fork into place.

The music was, of course, from next door. From Kai. The sonic signature of her childhood summers had been the whisper of the Pacific against the bluffs below the inn. The soundtrack of this particular homecoming was apparently reggae at an eardrum-vibrating volume, courtesy of the owner of Driftwood Surf School.

She took a deep, centering breath, inhaling the scent of Aunt Clara’s prize roses—a deep, velvety crimson she’d cut that morning—and the salty tang of the California coast. The garden was a masterpiece of controlled chaos, just like Clara had been. Wisteria dripped from the pergola where the service would be held. Hummingbirds dueled over feeders. It was perfect. Or it would be, if the air wasn’t also vibrating with the promise of irie vibes.

“He’ll stop,” she told herself, aligning a water glass precisely one inch from the plate. “He has to. It’s a memorial service.”

The music pulsed on.

Elara’s jaw tightened. She was a woman who built her life on foundations of color-coded spreadsheets and timelines that accounted for monsoon seasons in Mumbai. She planned corporate galas for tech billionaires who cried less over server crashes than they did over the wrong shade of canapé. She could handle a loud neighbor. Even a loud, infuriatingly cheerful, and—according to the brief, disastrous encounter when she’d arrived yesterday—devastatingly good-looking neighbor.

She’d marched over then, clipboard in hand like a shield. He’d been shirtless, waxing a surfboard in the dappled light of his ramshackle deck, muscles moving in a way that was frankly disrespectful to the concept of manual labor. “Do you think you could possibly keep it down?” she’d asked, her voice all polished steel. “I’m trying to arrange a funeral.”

He’d looked up, his eyes the color of the sea after a storm, and wiped his hands on his board shorts. A slow, unrepentant grin spread across his face. “Clara wouldn’t have wanted a wake, Elara. She’d have wanted a party. With better music than this, admittedly, but the sentiment stands.”

He’d remembered her name. From summers a decade ago, when she was a gawky teen with her nose in a book and he was the local surf prodigy, already effortlessly cool. The recognition threw her. “Be that as it may,” she’d managed, “the sentiment currently includes a reading of Emily Dickinson, which does not pair well with bass drops.”

He’d laughed, a warm, rolling sound. “Fair enough. For Clara.” He’d turned the music down to a dull throb. “But only for the Dickinson.”

Now, as the clock ticked toward the 2 p.m. service, Bob Marley was still philosophizing. It was an act of war.

The service itself, once it began, was a beautiful, tear-streaked blur. The garden filled with the vibrant, eclectic crowd Clara had collected: artists with paint under their nails, old fishermen with hands like driftwood, local shopkeepers, and a surprising number of people who just seemed to be passing through and had decided to stay. They told stories that made people laugh until they cried, and cried until they laughed. Elara, in her simple black dress, felt the structured dam she’d built around her grief begin to crack under the warmth of it all. She kept expecting to see Clara’s wild, silver-streaked hair bobbing through the crowd, handing out glasses of scandalously cheap champagne.

Kai, she noted, did attend. He stood at the very back, under the arch of bougainvillea, wearing a clean, short-sleeved button-down that looked like it had been wrestled into submission. He was quiet, respectful. He even looked mildly pained during the Dickinson. She felt a flicker of shame for her earlier irritation, which was immediately extinguished when, during the final moment of silence, the distant but unmistakable riff of “Buffalo Soldier” drifted from his property.

Later, she thought, her fingers curling. We will have words.

The words would have to wait for the reading of the will. Which was how, two hours later, Elara found herself in the cozy, book-crammed sitting room of The Mariposa with Mr. Henderson, Clara’s ancient, tortoise-like lawyer, and a handful of bemused beneficiaries—including the head librarian, who got Clara’s collection of vintage erotica (“For the restricted section, my dear!” Clara had apparently quipped), and the local stray cat population, who were now the beneficiaries of a sizable trust for tuna.

“And to my beloved niece, Elara June Finch,” Mr. Henderson intoned, his spectacles perched on the end of his nose, “I leave the heart of my world: The Mariposa Inn, its land, and all its attendant charms and chaos.”

Elara’s breath caught. The room seemed to swell with golden afternoon light. The inn. The creaky floorboards she’d tiptoed over as a child, the window seat where she’d read countless novels, the kitchen that always smelled of cinnamon and possibility. It was hers. A tangible piece of happiness, a sanctuary. Her eyes welled up.

“However,” Mr. Henderson continued, clearing his throat with a sound like gravel in a tin can. “There is a condition.”

A condition. Elara blinked. Conditions were her specialty. She could meet a condition.

“Clara was a romantic, as we all know,” the lawyer said, a faint smile playing on his lips. “She believed in the enduring power of love, stability, and shared responsibility. As such, the full and unencumbered ownership of The Mariposa is bequeathed to Elara… on the condition that she is legally and matrimonially wedded within one calendar year of the date of my passing.”

The silence was absolute, broken only by the cheerful tink of a wind chime outside.

“I’m sorry,” Elara said, her voice strangely calm. “It is bequeathed to me on the condition that I… what?”

“Married, dear,” Mr. Henderson said gently, as if explaining rain. “Twelve months. Three hundred and sixty-five days. Till death do you part, etcetera.”

A laugh bubbled up in Elara’s throat, sharp and disbelieving. “That’s… that’s insane. That’s a plot from a bad Regency novel. She can’t be serious.”

“She was entirely serious. Clause 4B: The Matrimony Mandate. Her words. If the condition is not met, the inn will be sold, and the proceeds will be divided among… ah, yes, the Sea Lion Rescue Center and a fund to provide free wetsuits for underprivileged children.”

Elara stared at him. She was being thwarted by sea lions and neoprene charity.

“There’s more,” Mr. Henderson said, shuffling papers. “A financial disclosure. The Mariposa, while beloved, is… financially delicate. Clara was better at making people feel at home than balancing ledgers. There is a significant mortgage in arrears, and the inspection report…” He slid a document toward her. “The roof is, quote, ‘in a romantic relationship with the concept of gravity.’ The plumbing is ‘of historical interest.’ The electrical system ‘possesses a thrilling, unpredictable vitality.’ In short, my dear, it needs work. A great deal of work.”

The beautiful inheritance suddenly felt like a heavy, crumbling stone around her neck. A million-dollar problem wrapped in a matrimonial ultimatum. She was a planner, not a magician. You couldn’t Gantt-chart your way into a genuine marriage. And you certainly couldn’t fund a new roof with whimsy.

The next morning, armed with a industrial-strength coffee and a sense of impending doom, Elara retreated to The Salty Bean, the town’s hub of gossip and caffeine. She needed to think, to process, to make a list. She was on List Three (“Potential Roofers – Not Charmingly Incompetent”) when the bell above the door jingled.

Kai walked in. He looked like he’d just rolled out of the ocean and into his clothes—which, given the damp hair and the towel around his neck, he probably had. He moved with a loose-limbed grace that made the small space seem smaller. He didn’t see her, tucked in her corner booth, and went straight to the counter where Marnie, the owner, was polishing espresso cups.

“Marn,” he said, and his voice had lost all its usual easygoing melody. It was low, strained. “Any word from the bank?”

Marnie’s kindly face fell. “Oh, honey. I heard. Denied?”

“Laughed out of the office would be more accurate.” Kai ran a hand through his dark, tousled hair. “The buyout offer from Coastal Luxe Resorts expires at the end of the month. If I can’t get a loan to refinance, Driftwood is a memory. They’ll bulldoze it, put up some glass monstrosity with a ‘curated surf experience.’” He said the last words like they tasted of bile.

“There’s no other way?” Marnie asked, her voice soft.

“I’ve sold every board I can spare. I’m teaching lessons from dawn till dusk. It’s not enough. The land’s worth a fortune now. They want it.” He leaned on the counter, his broad shoulders slumping. “It was my dad’s place. It’s… it’s everything.”

Elara froze, her pen hovering over her notebook. She shouldn’t be listening. This was private, raw. This was the sound of a dream drowning. But she couldn’t move.

“I just need a lifeline,” Kai murmured, more to himself than to Marnie. “A miracle. Or a very rich, very foolish spouse.”

He tried to laugh, but it died in his throat. Marnie reached over and patted his hand. “Something will turn up, Kai. It has to.”

He nodded, thanked her for the coffee he didn’t order, and turned to leave. For a fleeting second, his stormy eyes swept across the room and met hers. There was no charm in his gaze now, just a hollowed-out worry that mirrored the one sitting like a cold stone in her own stomach. A flicker of embarrassment crossed his face—he’d been overheard—then he was gone, the door jingling shut behind him.

Elara sat perfectly still. The sounds of the coffee shop—the hiss of steam, the clatter of cups, the low murmur of conversation—faded into a distant hum. Her eyes drifted down, not seeing her lists of roofers and debts. They landed on the crisp, legal copy of Clara’s will, which she’d brought with her as a form of self-flagellation.

Clause 4B: The Matrimony Mandate.

Her gaze lifted, through the window, to where Kai was unlocking a battered, sand-crusted jeep. A man desperate to save his family’s legacy.

Her mind, that brilliant, over-analyzing, problem-solving machine, began to whir. It discarded emotion. It discarded propriety. It connected points A and B with ruthless, logical efficiency.

Point A: She needed a spouse. A temporary, paper-only spouse to satisfy a clause and secure a crumbling inn.
Point B: He needed money. A substantial sum to pay off a predatory loan and save his business.

A desperate, insane idea began to form. It was monstrous. It was clinical. It was the kind of thing that happened in screwball comedies and ended with people falling in love for real against their better judgment.

A business proposition. A mutually beneficial arrangement. A prenup clause of their own making.

Her heart hammered against her ribs. She thought of Kai’s laughing eyes, his infuriating music, the stark despair on his face just moments ago. She thought of The Mariposa’s sagging porch, the smell of its old books, the way the light fell in her aunt’s bedroom in the morning.

It was madness.

But as she watched Kai’s jeep pull away, kicking up a cloud of golden dust in the coastal sun, Elara Finch, master planner, began to draft a new list in her mind. The heading was simple, terrifying, and utterly compelling.

Proposal: A Marriage of Convenience.
