Chapter 7: Burned

CHAPTER 7: BURNED

The air in Julian Thorne’s office was always a perfect 21 degrees Celsius, but as Dr. Elara Vance stood before his monolithic desk, she felt a glacial sweat trickle down her spine. The scent of his sandalwood cologne, usually a subtle note, now felt cloying, a chemical mask over the rot she now knew festered within NexaGene’s heart.

“The Singapore data is… perplexing,” Thorne said, his voice a smooth instrument. He didn’t look up from his tablet, his finger swiping through holographic charts that hovered above the polished obsidian surface. They were the epidemiological models for the Nemesis test—the one she’d tried to sabotage. “A containment anomaly. The pathogen breached the initial quarantine zone faster than any model predicted. Almost as if it was helped.”

Dr. Elara Vance’s mouth was a desert. “The mutation rate you described is unprecedented. Perhaps the predictive algorithms are flawed.”

“Perhaps.” Finally, he looked up. His eyes, the color of a winter sea, held no warmth, only a calculating curiosity. “Our systems are, however, exceptionally robust. They account for variables. Even human ones.”

He tapped the tablet. The wall to Dr. Elara Vance’s right shimmered and resolved into a high-resolution security feed. It showed the access log for the Level-4 pathogen library, time-stamped 02:14 AM three nights ago. Her keycard ID, ELARA VOSS, DVM, PhD, glowed a guilty green. A second window played footage: her, in her lab coat, fingers flying over a terminal, inputting a sequence of commands designed to look like a system diagnostic, but which contained, buried in the code, a subtle re-routing of the viral dispersal protocol. It was meant to trigger a cascade failure in the aerosolization system, a silent, abortive hiccup. It hadn’t failed. It had mutated.

“You have remarkable depth, Dr. Voss,” Thorne said, leaning back in his chair, steepling his fingers. “The veterinary background was a masterstroke. Who would suspect the animal doctor of understanding human-specific neurotropic vectors well enough to attempt this… creative recalibration?”

The room seemed to shrink, the soundproofed walls inching closer. The gentle hum of the climate control became the drone of a trapped insect. She said nothing. Denial was a child’s game here.

“The Syndicate was divided on you,” he continued, as if discussing a mildly interesting stock portfolio. “Reed argued for your genius, pure and simple. Others saw a loose end from the Lazarus fiasco. I proposed a middle way. A test. Bring you into the heart of the machine, show you its terrible beauty, and see what you would do.” A cold smile touched his lips. “Your attempt at sabotage was predicted, with 78% probability. Your method of choice, however, was inspired. And the outcome… even more so. You didn’t stop the test. You improved it. The mutated strain has a 12% higher transmission rate in humid environments. Singapore is nothing if not humid.”

A nausea, deep and fundamental, rolled through her. She hadn’t stopped them. She’d become their unwitting tool. Her hands, hidden behind her back, clenched into fists, nails biting into her palms—a sharp, clean pain to anchor her.

“Why are you telling me this?” Her voice was a rasp, stripped of pretense.

“To see your face,” he said simply. “To confirm the loyalty assessment. The test is complete. You acted against the project, but in doing so, you demonstrated a ruthless practicality and an intuitive grasp of viral mechanics we can use. The Syndicate believes in harnessing chaos, Dr. Elara Vance. You are chaos with a microscope. You can either be a valuable asset… or you can be a contained variable.”

He stood, moving around the desk with a predator’s grace. He stopped within arm’s reach, and she could see the fine weave of his suit, the cold, perfect whiteness of his collar. “The choice is binary. Sign the full disclosure pact, receive the implant that allows for… continuous loyalty monitoring, and help us steer Nemesis to its glorious, cleansing purpose. Or,” he gestured to the silent door, “walk out that door. Your contract will be terminated. With extreme prejudice.”

He was offering her a gilded cage and a collar, or a death sentence. He believed he had her cornered. He believed the woman who had buried herself in a veterinary clinic was broken.

Dr. Elara Vance let her shoulders slump, a fraction. She allowed a tremor into her hand as she raised it to push a strand of hair from her face—a gesture of defeat. She saw the faint gleam of triumph in his eyes.

“I… need to think,” she whispered.

“You have until the end of the day,” Thorne said, turning back to his desk, dismissing her. “Security will escort you to your lab to collect your personal effects. While you… think.”
The escort was two silent men in tactical gear that whispered as they moved. They didn’t touch her, but their presence was a wall, herding her through the sterile corridors. The NexaGene campus, once a labyrinth of potential, was now a prison of polished steel and glass. She saw everything with new, horrifying clarity: the biometric scanners were gates. The serene atrium was a kill box. The smiling colleagues were potential executioners.

In her lab, under the watchful eyes of the guards posted at the door, she packed a small box with meaningless trinkets: a coffee mug, a framed photo of a wolf from her Montana days, a few textbooks. Her mind was a scalpel, cutting through the panic. Thorne was Syndicate. The test was a test. They are watching. The safehouse is compromised.

Her personal comm device was a brick, no doubt loaded with trackers and listeners. She left it in the drawer. Her hands, moving with a calm she did not feel, brushed over the veterinary emergency kit she’d insisted on keeping in her bottom cabinet—a relic of her old life, a security blanket. It contained standard field supplies: syringes, broad-spectrum antibiotics, saline, and a few vials of potent animal-grade sedatives and paralytics. One vial, labeled “Xylazine-Z – Equine Sedative. EXTREME CAUTION. Human contact: seek immediate medical aid.” was three-quarters full. A neurotoxin that could induce paralysis and unconsciousness in a 1200-pound animal within seconds. In humans, the effects would be violently unpredictable, but fast.

She palmed the vial, the glass cool against her skin, and slipped it into the sleeve of her lab coat as she stood, box in hand.

“Ready,” she said, her voice hollow.

The drive to her corporate apartment was silent. The guards walked her to the door. “You have two hours to vacate,” one said, his voice devoid of inflection. “Corporate housing will be revoked. A team will come to assist with your transition.”

Assist with your transition. A euphemism that tasted of copper and fear. She locked the door, leaning against it, listening to their receding footsteps. They wouldn’t go far.

She moved. Not with frenzy, but with a desperate, calculated speed. She changed into dark, durable clothing—jeans, a black sweater, hiking boots. She emptied her go-bag of its corporate-approved contents and filled it with the only things that mattered now: cash from a hidden compartment in her suitcase, fake IDs from a life she’d hoped was over, a compact satellite phone she’d never activated. She unscrewed the base of a cheap desk lamp, retrieving a single encrypted data chip: the raw, unaltered genomic sequence of the original Lazarus vector, her life’s work, her sin, and now, possibly, her only weapon.

From her veterinary kit, she prepared the Xylazine-Z. Using a sterile syringe, she drew the clear liquid and injected it into a small, travel-sized bottle of saline nasal spray, mixing it with the remaining solution. A crude, horrific delivery system. She pocketed it.

A soft click at the door—not the handle, but the electronic lock disengaging. They weren’t waiting two hours.

Dr. Elara Vance melted into the bathroom, leaving the main door ajar. The first man entered, gun raised, sweeping the room. He was professional, quiet. The second followed, covering his advance. She heard the rustle of their gear, the soft shush of their boots on carpet.

As the first passed the bathroom door, she stepped out. Not attacking him. She sprayed the modified nasal solution into the air between them, a fine mist catching the light from the window.

“What the—” The lead man grunted, swatting at his face. He took another step, then faltered. His weapon clattered to the floor as his hand spasmed uncontrollably. His eyes widened in shock, the neural signals to his muscles firing and dying in chaotic bursts. He collapsed, twitching, a guttural choke escaping his lips. The second man, reacting fast, raised his weapon, but he’d inhaled the aerosolized toxin. He stumbled back against the wall, his finger convulsing on the trigger, firing a suppressed round into the ceiling. Dust rained down. He slid to the floor, his body rigid, his breath coming in ragged, wet gasps.

The claustrophobia of the apartment exploded into the wider, more terrifying claustrophobia of the hunt. Dr. Elara Vance stepped over the paralyzed men, their unblinking eyes tracking her, full of a terrible understanding. She took a comm unit from one, a sidearm from the other. Then she was in the stairwell, descending not to the lobby, but to the sub-basement garage, moving like a ghost through the concrete bowels of the building.

She emerged into the damp, cold night of the city. The rain was a fine mist, turning neon signs into smears of color. She used cash for a taxi to the bus station, then doubled back on foot through a series of alleyways, her senses screaming at every shadow, every distant siren. She was a virus herself now, moving against the host’s immune system.

For three days, she vanished. She slept in the husks of abandoned factories in the industrial district, the air thick with the ghosts of rust and chemicals. She ate cold food from cans, her body running on adrenaline and grim purpose. The data chip burned a hole in her pocket. On the fourth night, under the cover of a pounding downpour that washed the city in noise and blur, she went to the one place she’d sworn never to return: the long-term storage facility on the city’s edge.

Unit 147. Paid for a decade in advance under a false name. The key was buried in a magnetic case under a specific bridge abutment, a secret from her past life. The lock groaned open. Inside was not furniture, but a climate-controlled safe. Behind its door lay the physical artifacts of her fall: lab notebooks in her precise handwriting, sample vials of the original Lazarus strain cryogenically preserved in a portable Dewar, and her old, uncrackable research laptop.

In the dim, damp cube of the storage unit, surrounded by the detritus of other people’s forgotten lives, Dr. Elara Vance connected the laptop and inserted the chip. The Lazarus sequences bloomed across the screen, a twisted, beautiful ladder of nucleotides. She compared it to the Nemesis data she had memorized, the architecture she’d seen in NexaGene’s core.

Her breath caught. It wasn’t just inspired by her work. It was her work. A significant portion of the delivery vector, the mechanism that allowed the pathogen to cross the blood-brain barrier with such eerie precision, was a direct, optimized copy of her Lazarus design. Thorne hadn’t just recruited her. He’d plundered her. Nemesis was Lazarus’s more vicious, more controllable sibling.

The realization was a sucker punch, followed by a cold, clarifying wave. She couldn’t just stop the release. Thorne and the Syndicate had countless distribution methods, redundant plans. Destroying one lab, disrupting one test, would be a delay, not a defeat. They were a hydra.

She had to think like them. Like a scientist. For every pathogen, there is a receptor. For every key, a lock. To kill Nemesis, she needed a universal key-blocker. A countermeasure that would bind to the vector, render it inert, before it could ever deliver its payload. A vaccine was impossible—it would require exposing the immune system. She needed a pre-emptive neutralizer. And the only template for creating one was the original key itself: her Lazarus vector. She would have to use the monster to build the cage.

The magnitude of the task was paralyzing. She needed a lab. She needed resources. She needed time she didn’t have. She was one woman, hunted by a global network of limitless wealth and power.

Then she remembered the initial message. The anonymous source who had first alerted her to NexaGene’s dark turn. The one who had known to contact her. At the time, she’d been too focused on infiltration to trace it properly. Now, with the tools from her cache, she could. She booted a forensic tracking program, feeding it the metadata from the long-deleted message.

It took an hour, the program spidering through dead servers and encrypted relays. Finally, it pinged a location. Not a corporate hub. A private residential address in the old city. And attached to that address, a name retrieved from a hacked medical database: Dr. Aris Thorne. Terminal diagnosis: Glioblastoma multiforme. Stage IV. Life expectancy: 6-9 months.

Thorne.

A relative? A brother? A disinherited conscience?

The message had been sent three weeks before Julian Thorne offered her the job. It wasn’t a leak. It was a plea. And the dying man who sent it was her only conceivable ally inside the maze. He had the knowledge. He had the access, or had once. And he had the one thing even Julian Thorne could not buy: nothing left to lose.

Dr. Elara Vance powered down the laptop. The rain had stopped, leaving the city in a cold, dripping silence. She packed the Dewar and the notebooks into her bag. The gun felt heavy against her ribs. She was no longer just a fugitive trying to stop a crime. She was a scientist, armed with the blueprint of a sin, standing in the ruins of her own life, tasked with building a miracle from the ashes.

She had to find Aris Thorne. Before the Syndicate found him. And before the last flicker of his conscience was extinguished, taking her only chance for a cure with it.
