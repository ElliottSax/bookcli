Chapter 11: The Cure is Worse

The air in the primary pumping station tasted of rust, chlorine, and dread. It was a cathedral of industrial decay, a vast, echoing chamber where gargantuan pipes came together like the arteries of a petrified giant. The only light came from harsh, flickering fluorescents that threw long, leaping shadows and gleamed off puddles of stagnant water on the concrete floor. The hum was a physical thing—a deep, sub-aural vibration from the pumps that thrummed through the soles of Elara’s shoes and into her bones.

She stood before the heart of the city’s thirst: the main intake manifold. It was a monstrous, valve-studded steel nexus where river water was sucked in, cleaned, and sent out to millions. Now, it was an executioner’s block.

Victor Thorne stood beside it, a figure of elegant ruin in his tailored coat. He held a sleek, titanium case. His men, four of them with the dead-eyed efficiency of expensive tools, flanked Elara, their presence a cold pressure against her back.

“Behold the aorta of New Carthage,” Thorne said, his voice almost reverent. He placed the case on a grime-caked control console and clicked it open. Nestled in black foam were two large, pressurized canisters. One was labeled with a simple, terrifying ‘N-1’. The other, ‘N-1-B’. The backup.

“The primary insertion point,” Elara whispered, the pieces clicking into a final, horrifying mosaic. “You don’t need to aerosolize it. You just… give them a drink.”

“Elegant, isn’t it?” Thorne said, running a gloved finger along the canister. “A city poisoned by its own lifeblood. There’s a poetry to it my financial advisors never appreciated.”

Elara’s mind, frayed from days of sleepless terror, scrambled for a weakness. The Lazarus Vector—her benign, curative virus—was a weight in the inner pocket of her stolen lab coat. A thimbleful of hope against an ocean of venom.

“Why this, Thorne?” she asked, forcing her voice into something calm and clinical. She needed his narcissism like she needed air. “Nemesis is a masterpiece of targeted genetic malice. This… this is a sledgehammer. It betrays the science.”

Thorne’s composure cracked, just a hairline fracture. “The science was perverted long before I touched it,” he hissed. He turned from the canister, his eyes finding hers in the gloom. “The Lazarus Protocol was meant to be a fountain of youth, a cure for degenerative hell. My family funded its early research. Then a batch, a single flawed batch, was used in a trial here. It failed. Catastrophically. Not a resurrection, but a slow, neurological unraveling.”

He paused, the memory a bitter taste on his tongue. “The class-action lawsuit didn’t just bankrupt us. It eviscerated us. My father drank a bullet beside our swimming pool. My mother followed him into oblivion with pills. The vultures of New Carthage picked our name clean from the bones. All for a flaw they demanded we rush to market.”

Elara felt a chill that had nothing to do with the damp.
