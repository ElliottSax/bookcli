Chapter 2: A Crack in the Glass

A vacuum sealed against the world, the room was Leo Finch’s design: a windowless consultation space in the law firm’s basement, soundproofed, with walls the color of dried cement. Cool, surgical light from a single LED panel overhead left no shadow unexamined. The air carried the scent of recycled oxygen and the faint, lemon-scented ghost of industrial cleaner. This was his laboratory. The witness was his specimen.

Across the steel table, Evelyn Vance sat looking profoundly out of place—a watercolor in a graphite sketch. In her early sixties, she possessed the serene, unassailable composure of someone who had arranged both flowers and lives with equal precision. A dove-grey cashmere sweater and a single strand of pearls complemented silver hair styled in a soft wave against her jaw. Her folded hands rested perfectly still on the table. Leo had expected nervous fidgeting from someone about to have their story dissected. Evelyn exhibited only a polite, patient curiosity, as if awaiting a slightly delayed tea service.

He offered no tea. Between them, he placed a digital recorder, its red eye a pulsating bead. Next to it lay a slim folder containing nothing but a blank notepad and a single pen. No rustle of paper would provide a distraction.

“Mrs. Vance,” he began, his voice softening in the sterile quiet. “Thank you for agreeing to this. My name is Leo Finch. I’ve been engaged by Mr. Thorne to review your recollection of the events of October 12th.”

“That’s what we’re here to establish.” Leo met her gaze, finding her eyes a clear, placid blue. “I’m going to ask you to tell me about that day, from the moment you woke up until the moment you went to sleep. Don’t edit anything. Details are the point, no matter how trivial they seem.”

Evelyn gave a slight nod, her gaze drifting to a point on the blank wall as if a screen were descending there. Her measured voice began a calm recitation.

“I woke at six-fifteen, as I always do. The room was cool. I remember the weight of the linen duvet. I made coffee in the French press—Sumatra, a dark roast. The smell was particularly sharp that morning.” She painted a mundane masterpiece: the slight ache in her right knee, a sign of coming rain; the ceramic mug’s handle, a little too narrow for comfort; the click-clack of her shears deadheading chrysanthemums on the balcony, the spent blooms a crisp brown.

Leo listened, his mind a silent cross-referencing machine. Her account of the morning news—a segment about a city council zoning dispute—matched the broadcast logs. She described sluggish traffic on the drive to the botanical garden, delayed by roadwork on the Lancaster Avenue overpass. Department of Transportation records confirmed the closure. She spoke
