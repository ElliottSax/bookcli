Chapter 2: A Crack in the Glass

The room was a vacuum, sealed against the world. Leo Finch had insisted on it: a windowless consultation space in the law firm’s basement, soundproofed, with walls the color of dried cement. The only light came from a single LED panel overhead, cool and surgical, leaving no shadow unexamined. The air smelled of recycled oxygen and the faint, lemon-scented ghost of industrial cleaner. This was his laboratory. The witness was his specimen.

Evelyn Vance sat across the steel table, looking profoundly out of place. She was a watercolor in a graphite sketch. In her early sixties, she possessed the serene, unassailable composure of someone who had arranged both flowers and lives with equal precision. She wore a dove-grey cashmere sweater and a single strand of pearls, her silver hair a soft wave against her jaw. Her hands, folded on the table, were still. Leo had expected nervousness, the fidgeting of someone about to have their story dissected. Evelyn exhibited only a polite, patient curiosity, as if waiting for a slightly delayed tea service.

Leo didn’t offer tea. He placed a digital recorder between them, its red eye a pulsating bead. Next to it, a slim folder containing nothing but a blank notepad and a single pen. He wanted no rustle of paper to distract.

“Mrs. Vance,” he began, his voice softer than he intended in the sterile quiet. “Thank you for agreeing to this. My name is Leo Finch. I’ve been engaged by Mr. Thorne to review your recollection of the events of October 12th.”

“A review,” she echoed, smiling gently. “It sounds so formal. My memory is quite clear, Mr. Finch.”

“That’s what we’re here to establish.” Leo met her gaze. Her eyes were a clear, placid blue. “I’m going to ask you to tell me about that day, from the moment you woke up until the moment you went to sleep. Don’t edit anything. Details are the point, no matter how trivial they seem.”

Evelyn gave a slight nod, her gaze drifting to a point on the blank wall as if a screen were descending there. When she began to speak, her voice was measured, a calm recitation.

“I woke at six-fifteen, as I always do. The room was cool. I remember the weight of the linen duvet. I made coffee in the French press—Sumatra, a dark roast. The smell was particularly sharp that morning.” She went on, painting a mundane masterpiece: the slight ache in her right knee, a sign of coming rain; the feel of the ceramic mug, its handle a little too narrow for comfort; the click-clack of her shears as she deadheaded the chrysanthemums on her balcony, the spent blooms a crisp brown.

Leo listened, his own mind a silent cross-referencing machine. Her account of the morning news on the radio—a segment about a city council zoning dispute—was correct. He’d checked the broadcast logs. She described the sluggish traffic on her drive to the botanical garden, due to roadwork on the Lancaster Avenue overpass. Department of Transportation records confirmed the closure. She spoke
