Chapter 2: A Crack in the Glass

A vacuum sealed against the world, Leo Finch’s design created a windowless consultation space in the law firm’s basement, soundproofed, with walls the color of dried cement. Flat and slightly rough, the texture absorbed light and sound with a greedy indifference. Cool, surgical light from a single LED panel overhead left no shadow unexamined, bleaching the color from his own hands and making the veins stand out like faint blue rivers on a map. Recycled oxygen carried a sterile scent, mingled with the faint, lemon-scented ghost of industrial cleaner—a smell that always left a metallic tang at the back of his throat. This was his laboratory. The witness was his specimen.

Across the steel table, Evelyn Vance sat looking profoundly out of place, a watercolor in a graphite sketch. In her early sixties, she possessed the serene, unassailable composure of someone who had arranged both flowers and lives with equal precision. A dove-grey cashmere sweater, so fine it seemed to drink the light, and a single strand of pearls with a silver clasp complemented silver hair styled in a soft, immaculate wave against her jaw. Her folded hands rested perfectly still on the table, the skin translucent to reveal a delicate tracery of bones beneath. Leo had expected nervous fidgeting from someone about to have their story dissected—a tremor in the fingers, a compulsive smoothing of fabric. Evelyn exhibited only a polite, patient curiosity, as if awaiting a slightly delayed tea service. Her stillness was so complete it became a subtle rebuke to the room’s sterile anxiety.

He offered no tea. Between them, he placed a digital recorder, its red eye a pulsating bead, a tiny mechanical heart. The click of its housing against the steel table was a sharp, definitive sound. Next to it lay a slim folder of grey cardstock containing nothing but a blank notepad, its paper a stark, expectant white, and a single black pen. No rustle of paper would provide a distraction. He wanted only the raw material of her voice, the unadorned architecture of her memory.

“Mrs. Vance,” he began, his voice softening in the sterile quiet to become a calibrated instrument. “Thank you for agreeing to this. My name is Leo Finch. I’ve been engaged by Mr. Thorne to review your recollection of the events of October 12th.”

“A review,” she echoed. Gentle words held a filament of something else—amusement, perhaps, or a quiet challenge. A gentle smile touched her lips but didn’t quite reach her placid blue eyes. “It sounds so formal. My memory is quite clear, Mr. Finch.”

“That’s what we’re here to establish.” Leo met her gaze, holding it. Her eyes were the clear, calm blue of a winter sky over a frozen lake. A familiar, cold focus settled over him. In this room, he was not a man but a function: a sieve for truth. “I’m going to ask you to tell me about that day, from the moment you woke up until the moment you went to sleep. Don’t edit anything. Details are the point, no matter how trivial they seem. The weather. The quality of the light. What you heard in the background.”

Evelyn gave a slight, graceful nod, her gaze drifting to a point on the blank wall as if a screen were descending there, a private cinema for one. Her measured voice began a calm, unhurried recitation, a voice used to being listened to.

“I woke at six-fifteen, as I always do. The room was cool—the first proper chill of autumn had settled in overnight. I remember the specific weight of the linen duvet, a pleasant heaviness. The light through the blinds was thin and grey, not yet sun, just a suggestion of it.” She paused, her eyes narrowing a fraction as she looked inward. “I made coffee in the French press—Sumatra, a dark roast. The smell was particularly sharp that morning, almost smoky. It filled the kitchen, a warm, earthy counterpoint to the cool air.”

Leo listened, his mind a silent cross-referencing machine. He did not write, did not move. He absorbed. Her account was a mundane masterpiece, painted with a fine brush. She described the slight, familiar ache in her right knee, a dull throb she attributed to the coming rain. She mentioned the ceramic mug’s handle, a little too narrow for comfort, the ridge of it pressing into her finger. She spoke of the click-clack of her shears deadheading chrysanthemums on the balcony, the sound crisp and final, the spent blooms a brittle brown that crumbled to dust between her fingers.

“The silence was different that morning,” she continued, her voice dropping half a note. “Usually, there are sparrows in the ivy on the east wall. A constant, cheeping chatter. That day, nothing. Just the distant, muffled groan of the city waking up. It felt… expectant.”

A minor trigger engaged in Leo’s mind. Anomaly. An unverifiable, subjective sensory detail—missing birdsong—served as a potential emotional marker. He stored it.

She painted the drive to the botanical garden with the same precision. “The traffic on Crestview was sluggish. Not the usual impatient honking, but a resigned, slow crawl. The car ahead of me had a broken brake light, the plastic casing cracked. The light inside flickered weakly, a faint, irregular pulse of red against the grey morning. It was hypnotic, and a little sad.” She described being delayed by roadwork on the Lancaster Avenue overpass; the smell of hot tar and diesel fumes had seeped into her car despite the closed windows, a gritty, chemical taste at the back of her throat. Department of Transportation records, which Leo had memorized, confirmed the closure. Her timing was exact.

“When I finally arrived at the garden,” she said, her hands unfolding for the first time, one resting lightly atop the other, “the air changed. The city smells fell away. It was damp earth, wet stone, and the sweet, heavy perfume of late-blooming osmanthus. It was so strong it was almost cloying. I remember taking a deep breath, trying to clear the tar from my lungs.”

She described her walk along the Magnolia Promenade. The path was paved with crushed oyster shells that gritted softly under her shoes. She recalled the specific, waxy green of a camellia leaf, a single bead of rainwater clinging to its tip, refracting the world into a tiny, inverted dome. She noted a gardener in a brown jacket, his back to her, pruning a hedge, the steady snick-snick of his shears a metronome in the quiet.

Then, she arrived at the glasshouse.

“The transition was always a shock,” she murmured, her gaze becoming fixed on the cement wall as if she could see the vast structure there. “From the muted, damp chill of the outside to that wall of humid warmth when you opened the door. The glass was fogged with condensation, streaked where it had begun to run. Inside, the air was thick, pressuring the ears. It smelled of loam, of verdant decay, of a thousand different greens breathing.”

Leo leaned forward an inch, a barely perceptible shift. This was the threshold. The mundane was about to collide with the moment.

“I went to see the Victoria amazonica lilies. They were past their prime, the great pads beginning to brown at the edges, but I liked their decline. It felt honest.” She took a slow, deliberate breath. “I was admiring the structure of one—the ribs underneath the leaf were like the vaulting of a cathedral—when I heard it.”

“Heard what, Mrs. Vance?” Leo’s voice was a soft prompt, devoid of inflection.

“A voice. Raised. Not a shout, but… a sharp projection. A man’s voice. It came from the direction of the tropical orchid bays, around the corner and down three shallow stone steps.” Her own voice remained even, but her fingers now pressed together, the knuckles paling slightly. “The words were muffled by the foliage and the water features, but the tone was unmistakable. It was anger. A contained, seething kind of anger.”

“Can you recall any of the words?”

She closed her eyes. The LED light cast faint lavender shadows on her lids. “It’s… fractured. The acoustics were strange. Water was dripping from somewhere—a slow, plinking sound onto a broad leaf. I heard ‘…cannot continue…’ and then a moment later, ‘…consequences will be…’ The last word was lost. Then there was a lower sound, a murmur, a response I couldn’t make out at all.”

“What did you do?”

“I stood very still.” Her eyes opened, finding Leo’s. Her composure was still there, but beneath it, he saw a flicker of something raw—the prickle of unease she must have felt in that humid air. “It felt… private. Ugly. I didn’t want to intrude, but I also didn’t want to be seen listening. I took a step back, behind the broad trunk of a fiddle-leaf fig. The leaves were huge, dusty. I remember the texture of the bark against my shoulder, rough and slightly damp.”

She described the sound of footsteps then—not walking, but a sharp, decisive turn on the gravel path. A fast, receding crunch. Then, silence, broken only by the perpetual drip of water and the low hum of the climate control system.

“After a minute, perhaps two, I heard a different set of footsteps. Slower. Heavier. They came closer.” For the first time, Evelyn’s hand moved from its resting place to touch the pearls at her throat, a brief, self-soothing gesture. “A man walked past the opening to my alcove. He was perhaps fifty, with steel-grey hair cut very short. He wore a dark overcoat, though it was quite warm in the glasshouse. His face…” She searched for the word. “It was set. Like stone. He was looking straight ahead, but not seeing the plants. He was somewhere else entirely. And in his right hand, held loosely at his side, was a walking stick. Not a cane for support. A polished malacca cane with a silver handle.”

Leo’s blood went quiet in his veins. This was the first concrete, visual detail that aligned with a known element: the victim, Alistair Drake, had been found with severe blunt-force trauma. A weapon had never been located.

“Did you see his face clearly?” Leo asked, his pen still untouched.

“Clearly enough. A strong jaw. Pale eyes. A thin, unsmiling mouth. He passed within ten feet of me. I could smell his cologne—something sharp and piney, like a cleaning product. It clashed with the humid floral air.”

“And then?”

“And then he was gone. Around the corner. The footsteps faded.” She let out a soft breath, her shoulders lowering almost imperceptibly. “I waited. My heart was beating… noticeably. Not racing, but a steady, hard knock against my ribs. I felt exposed. I decided to leave the glasshouse. I didn’t want to go the way he had gone, so I took a longer route, through the fern grotto.”

Her narrative continued, meticulous and calm once more. She described the feathery touch of a maidenhair fern against her wrist, the sudden, cooler air near the grotto’s artificial stream. She left the garden, drove home. The rest of her day was a quiet echo of the morning: sorting mail, the dry papery smell of it; reheating soup for lunch, the taste of thyme and cream; an afternoon spent reading, the weight of the book in her lap, the whisper of pages turning.

She had gone to bed early, she said, tired by the unspoken tension of the day. “I read for a while. The book was a novel about gardeners in the 18th century. I remember a line about ‘the violence necessary for cultivation.’ It struck me. I turned out the light at ten. The room was very dark. I listened to the wind pick up outside, a low moan in the eaves, and I thought about that man’s face. The set of it. I fell asleep.”

Silence filled the room, thicker now, charged with the images she had conjured. The red eye of the recorder pulsed on.

Leo let the silence stretch, counting five full seconds in his head. He watched her. The touch to the pearls. The precise, visual memory of the cane. The subjective but potent detail of the missing birdsong, the expectant silence. It was a near-perfect witness account: rich with sensory anchors, logically sequenced, emotionally consistent but not overwrought.

Too perfect?

“Mrs. Vance,” he said, his voice breaking the quiet like a thin blade. “You have an extraordinary memory.”

“I pay attention, Mr. Finch. Life is in the details, don’t you think?”

“I do.” He finally picked up the pen, but only to tap its end lightly, once, against the notepad. A tiny, dry click. “Let’s go back. To the voice. You said ‘cannot continue’ and ‘consequences will be.’ Were those the exact phonetic sounds? Or are those the words your mind has since assembled from the sounds?”

She blinked, the first sign of a break in her serene rhythm. “I… I believe they are the words. The sounds formed those words.”

“But the acoustics were poor. There was dripping water. Foliage. Could it have been ‘can now continue’? Or ‘consequences will not be’? The negation, or its absence, changes meaning.”

A faint vertical line appeared between her eyebrows. “I suppose it’s possible. It sounded like ‘cannot.’ And ‘will be.’ Not ‘will not be.’”

“You suppose.” Leo noted the correction, the slight defensiveness. “The man with the cane. You saw him for, by your estimate, three or four seconds as he passed. You noted his hair, his coat, his expression, his cane, even his cologne. Did you notice his shoes?”

Evelyn went still. Not her earlier composed stillness, but the frozen stillness of a mind searching a file and finding it empty. “His shoes?”

“Yes. Were they leather? Rubber soles? Scuffed? Clean? Was there gravel or moss on them from the path?”

“I… I didn’t look at his shoes.”

“What was on the handle of the cane? You said silver. Was it smooth? Ornate? A bird’s head? A sphere?”

Her lips parted slightly. The placid blue of her eyes clouded with the effort of recall. “It was… a simple curve. A rounded handle. I didn’t see an engraving.”

“When you stepped behind the fiddle-leaf fig, you felt the bark against your shoulder. Was your sweater snagged? Did you feel the moisture from it seep through the cashmere?”

Her hand went unconsciously to her right shoulder, as if checking. “No. It was just… a presence.”

Leo nodded slowly, placing the pen down with deliberate care. “You’ve given a remarkably vivid account, Mrs. Vance. Thank you. The mind is a fascinating instrument. It often fills in blanks with plausible information, creating a coherent picture. My job is to find where the picture is a perfect photograph, and where it might be a skilled painting.”

The color in her cheeks, a soft rose earlier, had faded to a more porcelain hue. Her composure was back, but it was tighter now, a glove pulled taut over the knuckles. “Are you suggesting I’m painting, Mr. Finch?”

“I’m suggesting memory is not a recording. It’s a living thing. It breathes. It changes. The smell of the coffee, the ache in your knee, the flickering brake light—those are brilliant, visceral details. They ground your story.” He leaned forward, the steel table edge pressing a cold line into his forearms. “The argument in the glasshouse… that is the story. And with that, the mind, understandably, might become more of an artist. It might, for instance, supply a weapon where one was only implied.”

Her breath caught, just a tiny hitch in the perfectly recycled air of the room. The sound was more telling than any gasp. “I saw what I saw.”

“I believe you did.” Leo’s voice was gentle again, almost kind. It was the gentleness of a pathologist. “We will go through it again. Slower. We will separate what your eyes registered from what your mind has since… contextualized.”

He reached out and pressed a button on the recorder. The red light went out. The sudden absence of its pulse left the room feeling colder.

“But first,” he said, “let’s take a moment. The air in here is very dry. It can be taxing.” He did not offer water. He simply let the silence, now his instrument, expand.

Evelyn Vance did not look at the blank wall anymore. She looked at Leo Finch. And in her clear, blue, watercolor eyes, he saw the first hairline fracture appear in the glass of her composure. It was not fear, not yet. It was the dawning realization that in this room, under this surgical light, she was not just a witness recounting a day. She was a system under stress testing, and the process had just begun. The sterile smell of lemon and metal was now undercut by a new, human scent: the faint, salty tang of perspiration, and the slow-burning aroma of unsettled certainty.
