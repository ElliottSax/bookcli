He perceives the world in overwhelming, perfect detail\u2014every sight, sound, smell, and emotion is recorded permanently and involuntarily.

      "description": "Initially presents as a sympathetic, tweed-clad academic figure who understands Leo's condition. Revealed to be a ruthless and ideologically driven scientist who has shed his academic skin for a more operational, sinister persona. He is the architect of the memory-implant technology and the murder cover-up.",
      "arc": "From benevolent authority to exposed villain. His arc is one of degradation, moving from the ethical high ground to seeing ethical boundaries as 'craters' to be crossed. His downfall is his own arrogance\u2014recording his confession\u2014and his failure to account for a witness (Leo) he cannot control or erase."

  "plot_summary": "Leo Finch, an archivist with perfect, involuntary memory, uses his condition to maintain precise records in a university archive. His life of managed sensory input is shattered when he discovers a digital file implicating a woman, Evelyn, in a murder. His memory reveals a flaw in the recording\u2014a detail that proves the memory was artificially implanted. Investigating, Leo uncovers a conspiracy led by his superior, Dr. Alistair Thorne, who is using experimental technology to edit witness testimony and fabricate reality. Thorne, having shed his academic guise, attempts to use a 'dampener' device to erase Leo's mind. However, Leo's organic memory is immune. He confronts Thorne, reciting the man's own digitally recorded confession verbatim. Leo emerges not to publicly expose the truth immediately, but to become its permanent, living archive. He accepts his role as the keeper of an unalterable record, walking into a silent, enduring vigil for the truth, carrying the proof of both a crime and an innocence within the impeccable prison of his own mind.",
