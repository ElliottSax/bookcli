Chapter 12: Veritas

The silence in the Alexander Institute’s main archival hall wasn’t an absence of sound, but a presence. It was the hum of climate control, the sigh of settling paper, the faint, ozone-tinged breath of servers stacked like tombs in the rear vault. To Leo, it was the sound of his own mind—ordered, catalogued, waiting. Tonight, it felt like a trap he’d walked right into.

He stood at the central bank of monitors, the cold blue light etching the hollows of his face. The stolen data was a live wire in his mind, every byte, every corrupted frame of Thorne’s confession playing on a loop behind his eyes. He had chosen this ground. Here, among the memories of others, he would fight for his own.

The main door hissed open. Not with the hurried swipe of a night guard, but with the deliberate, authorized thunk-click of a master key.

Samuel Thorne entered, no longer the harried, sympathetic administrator, but a man who had shed a skin. His usual tweed was gone, replaced by a dark, efficient sweater and trousers. In his hand was a device the size of a television remote, sleek and gunmetal grey, with a single, softly pulsating amber light.

“Leo,” Thorne said. His voice filled the archival space, too loud, a violation. “You shouldn’t have come back. This is the one place we can be sure of.”

Leo didn’t turn. He watched Thorne’s reflection warp in the dark monitor screen. “Where else would I go? You taught me that truth is in the record. The unalterable record.”

“The record is what we preserve.” Thorne moved closer, his shoes whispering on the polished concrete. The device in his hand whined, a sub-audible frequency that made Leo’s teeth ache. “What you have in your head… that’s not a record. It’s a disease. A beautiful, terrible disease. Rourke never understood that. He saw a tool. I saw a threat.”

Leo finally turned. The sight of the device clarified everything. A portable dampener. A crude, broad-spectrum thing meant to fog the recall of a conditioned subject, to make them pliable. Thorne thought he was a subject. He didn’t understand he was a chronicler.

“You used Evelyn,” Leo said, his voice flat. “You implanted the memory of a murder she didn’t witness. You used my research on episodic fidelity to make it stick. But you got greedy. You recorded your own confession. Insurance against Rourke. A digital memory you couldn’t trust to a human mind.”

Thorne’s face tightened, a flicker of surprise buried under cold anger. “You saw the file.”

“I remember the file,” Leo corrected. “Frame 347. The left corner of your desk, a photograph of your daughter. You said, ‘The subject is stable, but the ethical boundary is now a crater.’ Your exact words. You were proud.”

The amber light on the dampener glowed brighter. The whine pitched up, drilling into Leo’s temples. Thorne raised it. “You’re a flawed recording, Leo. All recordings need to be erased.”

He thumbed a switch.

What happened next wasn’t what Thorne expected. For Leo, it was
