Chapter 6: The Source

Chapter 6: The Source

The rain had settled into a permanent state of being, a fine mist that beaded on Leo’s office window and turned the city into a smeared watercolor of gray and sodium-orange. He hadn’t slept. The files before him were no longer paper and ink; they were a topography of lies, and he was mapping the fault lines.
Sharma’s final, frantic clue—the memory is not hers, but it is real—had unlocked a new and terrible logic. An implanted memory wasn’t conjured from nothing. It was a graft. To be flawless, to withstand the neurological scrutiny Sharma hinted at, it needed a source. A donor mind that had genuinely lived the experience. The alibi memory, that perfect, untouchable evening of solitude Evelyn Croft ‘remembered’… someone else had breathed that air, heard that music, felt that particular brand of boredom. The killer hadn’t just framed her; he’d donated a piece of his own consciousness to do it. The arrogance was breathtaking.
Leo pushed away from the crime scene photos—the ones he’d scrutinized until the bloodstain on the Persian rug looked like a familiar continent. Thorne’s manipulation was a distraction, a shiny object. The real thread was here, in the sensory residue of a borrowed evening.
He began with the music. Evelyn, under his gentle, persistent questioning, had recalled it as background noise from the apartment below. “Classical,” she’d said. “But not pleasant. All tension, no release. A cello, I think, sawing away. It gave me a headache.”

Using his HSAM, Leo replayed the interview, isolating her description. He cross-referenced it with playlists, concert schedules, radio logs from that night. Nothing fit. Then he realized the error: he was searching for public consumption. This was private listening. The taste of the individual. He compiled a list of contemporary, dissonant classical works for solo cello from the last five years, a niche within a niche. He fed it into a database against known patrons of the arts, donors to avant-garde symphonies, collectors of obscure recordings.
The list was short. One name appeared with a frequency that like a thumbprint: Silas Rourke.
Rourke was a specter in the city’s financial world. A tech mogul who’d made his fortune in predictive behavioral algorithms and then retreated from the spotlight, his company a black box that quietly powered everything from stock market trades to political polling. He was Croft’s silent, vicious rival in the Aquifer deal—a battle for a water-rights algorithm that could map and control resources for decades. Croft had won. Two weeks later, Croft was dead.
Leo dug deeper, his pulse a dull thud in his ears. He re-interviewed Evelyn, this time not about events, but about atmosphere. He asked her to close her eyes.
“The room, Evelyn. Before the headache. The air.”

“Stale,” she whispered. “The air conditioner was broken. It was too warm.”

“Smells? Not perfume, not food. The ghost of a smell.”

She was silent for so long he thought she’d retreated. Then her nose wrinkled, a micro-expression of distaste. “My father… he smoked cigars. Awful things. I hated it. This was… similar, but different. Sweeter. Like spice and cedar, but with a chemical undertone. It made my tongue feel coated.”

A cigar. Not a generic cigar. Leo, whose memory could recall the exact scent of his grandfather’s pipe tobacco (Burley, cherry-cured), knew this was the key. He plunged into the arcane world of premium cigars, focusing on limited editions, custom rolls for specific clients. He cross-referenced brands known for sweet, spicy profiles with known purchasers. Again, Silas Rourke materialized. A Forbes profile from three years prior, picturing him in a shadowy library, mentioned his singular vice: a private stock of Hacienda de la Luna cigars, rolled on a defunct plantation using a hybrid tobacco plant that was now extinct. The article quoted a connoisseur: “They smell like Christmas and poison. Utterly unique. There are maybe five boxes left in the world. Rourke owns two.”

The connection was a live wire. Croft’s rival. The owner of the specific, rare sensory detail embedded in the false memory. The donor.
But it was circumstantial. A psychological profile built from sensory ghosts. He needed verification. He needed to smell the smoke himself.
Rourke’s primary residence was a fortress, but his retreat, his private club known as The Athenaeum, was less impregnable. A converted, austere mansion in the old city, it was a temple to data and discretion. Leo’s research indicated Rourke spent every Thursday night there in solitary study. The club’s security was digital, sophisticated, but its physical plant was historical, with the vulnerabilities of age.
Leo’s plan was a desperate, silent thing. He used Thorne’s own resources against him, accessing a legal database for The Athenaeum’s original blueprints, filed during a landmark dispute. He found the servant’s passages, the old coal delivery chute now used for trash, the blind spot in the camera coverage where the stone gargoyle’s wing cast a permanent shadow.
He moved on Thursday, under the cover of the weeping sky. The mist clung to his black jacket as he navigated the alley behind the club. The coal chute was sealed with a modern magnetic lock, but the frame was rusted. Using a tool of his own design—a thin, carbon-fiber shim pulsed with a targeted electromagnetic burst—he tricked the lock into thinking it was still engaged as he pried the frame open just enough to slip through. The interior was a tomb of warm, dry air, scented with ozone from servers and the faint, sweet dust of old paper.
He followed the blueprint in his mind, a three-dimensional map superimposed over the dark, narrow service corridor. The club was silent, a vacuum. His own breathing was deafening. He reached Rourke’s private study not from the main hall, but through a panel in the wainscoting that opened into a curtained alcove.
The room was exactly as he’d imagined, and yet profoundly wrong. It was all dark wood and soft, indirect lighting. One wall was a single, seamless sheet of data, glowing with gentle, flowing visualizations of information—market trends, social media sentiment clusters, global weather patterns. It was beautiful and utterly alien. The opposite wall held physical books, leather-bound and untouched. In the center was a single, high-backed armchair of worn burgundy leather, facing a cold fireplace.
And on a low obsidian table beside the chair sat a humidor. It was open.
Leo’s heart hammered against his ribs. He crept forward, his shoes silent on the deep Persian rug. The humidor was lined with Spanish cedar. Inside, nestled in indigo velvet, were five cigars. They were dark, veiny, and imperfect. He leaned down, his nose inches from the open box.
The smell washed over him: a cloying sweetness, like candied orange peel and clove, underpinned by something darker, earthier, and a sharp, almost medicinal chemical note. It was exactly as Evelyn had described. It was the smell from the memory. The donor’s signature.
A wave of vertigo hit him. This was it. The source. The man who had lived the alibi, who had then, somehow, had that experience carved from his own mind and stitched into Evelyn’s. The arrogance was no longer theoretical; it sat in this room, in this box. Rourke had not simply killed Croft; he had framed his daughter with a piece of his own soul, sanitized and delivered.
He needed a sample. A single strand of tobacco from the ashtray. He pulled a small evidence bag from his pocket, his fingers trembling. There, in a crystal dish, was the corpse of one cigar, its ash long and pale gray, perfectly preserved.
“I prefer to let them expire in dignity,” a voice said from the shadows behind the chair. It was a calm, dry voice, devoid of surprise. “The ritual is in the smoking, not the cleanup.”

Leo froze, the evidence bag dangling from his hand. The high-backed chair swiveled slowly.
Silas Rourke was thinner than in his photos, his face a landscape of intelligent bones. His hair was silver, cut close. He wore a simple, exquisitely tailored charcoal sweater and dark trousers. His eyes were the most striking feature: a pale, watery blue that held no warmth, only a terrifying, absorbent curiosity. He held no weapon. He simply steepled his fingers.
“Mr. Finch,” Rourke replied, a faint smile touching his lips. “I’ve been expecting your impressive memory.”

The words iced Leo’s spine. They weren’t a threat; they were an acknowledgment, a professor welcoming a promising student to a tutorial he’d already designed.
“You know me,” Leo said, his own voice sounding rough and unused.
“I know of you. The man who doesn’t forget. A fascinating anomaly in a world of curated amnesia.” Rourke’s gaze flicked to the evidence bag. “You found your donor, I see. Took you longer than I’d hoped. The cigar was the obvious thread. I wondered if you’d pull it.”

Leo’s mind raced, the map of his understanding tearing apart. “You… left it for me?”

“All of it,” Rourke sighed, as if slightly disappointed. “The memory’s sensory fidelity was a light. The music, the temperature, the smoke. It was a test. A first filter. If you couldn’t follow that here, you’d be useless to me.”

“Useless?” Leo spat the word. “You murdered Alistair Croft. You implanted a memory in his daughter’s head. I’m taking this to the police.”

Rourke laughed, a soft, papery sound. “With what? A bag of ash and a theory about donated consciousness? You sound like Dr. Sharma. Before her unfortunate accident.” He watched Leo flinch. “Yes, I know about your visit. Her research was… foundational. But crude. She understood the ‘how’ of memory transfer on a biochemical level, but not the ‘why.’ Not the art of it.”

Leo took a step back, his hand closing around the shim in his pocket. “The ‘why’ is you wanted the Aquifer deal. You wanted Croft gone and his daughter to take the fall.”

“The deal?” Rourke waved a dismissive hand. The data wall behind him shimmered, a new visualization blooming—a complex neural network, firing. “A trifle. A piece on the board. Croft was a dinosaur, pounding his chest over a single watering hole. I am mapping the ocean. His death was… a necessary calibration. And Evelyn was the perfect vessel. A traumatized, suggestible mind, already fractured by her father’s cruelty. Implanting the alibi was cleaner than killing her. And far more interesting.”

He leaned forward, his pale eyes gleaming. “Don’t you see, Finch? The trial, Thorne’s manipulations, your employer’s petty deceptions… it’s all noise. The signal is the memory itself. I didn’t just give Evelyn Croft an alibi. I proved it could be done. A perfect, seamless transfer of lived experience from one mind to another. Not a story, not a suggestion. The memory itself. The source code of a moment.”

Leo world tilt. He was not investigating a murder; he was being led through an experiment. “You’re insane.”

“I’m iterative,” Rourke corrected. “Croft was step one. Evelyn, step two. You, Mr. Finch, are the potential culmination. The man with the perfect recall. Imagine. What could we learn from a donor like you? Your memories aren’t faded reconstructions; they are pristine recordings. What happens when we transplant one of your memories into another mind? Would it retain its clarity? Could we, in effect, create perfect witnesses? Or perfect alibis? Or,” he paused, “simply spread a perfect, unchanging idea across humanity, immune to the corruption of forgetfulness?”

The scope of it crashed over Leo—a wave of pure, cerebral dread. This wasn’t about one murder. It was a prototype. And he was being auditioned for the next phase.
“I’m leaving,” L answered, his voice tight. “And this ends.”

“It doesn’t,” Rourke said calmly. He didn’t move to stop him. “Where will you go? To Thorne, who is in my pocket? To the police, who are already parsing data sets my company provides to predict crime? Your evidence is a feeling, a smell. I have the only existing copy of the memory implantation protocol. The rest, including Sharma’s notes, is ash.”

He stood then, unfolding to an unexpected height. “I’m not your enemy, Leo. May I call you Leo? I’m your only relevant audience. You spend your life trapped in a museum of your own past. I am offering you a way to curate the future. Help me refine the process. In return, I can give you something you’ve never known.”

“What?” Leo whispered, the question torn from him.
Rourke’s smile was genuine now, and all the more chilling for it. “Forgetfulness. I can find the memory—the one that haunts you, the one you play on a loop—and I can cut it out of you. Like a surgeon. A clean, precise deletion. You’d be free.”

The offer hung in the scented air, monstrous and seductive. The memory of his mother’s face, not in life, but in the stillness of the funeral home, a memory so sharp it could still draw blood… the promise of its removal was a physical ache.
He saw it then, the true hook. It wasn’t about being caught. It was about being chosen. The investigation, his HSAM, his entire life had been funneling him toward this man and this offer.
Leo looked from Rourke’s keen face to the glowing data wall, a map of a world Rourke was already rewriting, one mind at a time. He thought of Evelyn, lost in a prison of someone else’s evening.
He took another step back toward the alcove. “Go to hell.”

Rourke didn’t pursue. He simply sat back down, picking up a fresh cigar from the humidor. He didn’t light it merely st rolled it beneath his nose.
“A predictable response. Principled.” He sounded amused. “But you’ll be back, Leo. When you realize there is no other puzzle to solve. I am the source. And you… you are now part of the experiment. Your next move will be most instructive.”

Leo fled, back through the dark passages, the sweet-rotten smell of the cigar clinging to his clothes, a brand. He burst into the cool, wet night, gasping. The city’s noises rushed back—sirens, tires on wet asphalt—but they sounded distant, fake.
He had found the source, and the source had been waiting for him. The hook wasn’t in the capture; it was in the invitation. And as he disappeared into the rain, Leo knew with a crushing certainty that Rourke was right. The maze had no exit. Every path led back to that room, to that choice: to be a curator of memories, or to become, finally, a patient.
