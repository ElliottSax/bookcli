 heared Evelyn's mind, her identity, her very self. And they had done it to cover up a murder.

He needed to tell Anya. He needed to tell Evelyn. But the safe house was a tomb, and the world outside was a minefield. He had to move carefully. One wrong step, and the whole house of cards would come crashing down.

He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and the metallic tang of fear. His hands were shaking, but he forced himself to focus. He had to get this right.

He opened a secure messaging app and typed out a message to Anya. "I have it. All of it. Thorne was there. He killed Vale. We need to move fast."

He hit send and leaned back in his chair, his mind racing. He knew the risks, but he couldn't turn back now. He had to see this through, no matter the cost.

The laptop screen flickered, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The room felt smaller now, the air heavier. He could hear the distant hum of the city, a constant reminder of the world outside. But for now, he was alone in the dark, with only the cold glow of the screen to guide him.

He closed his eyes, trying to steady his breathing. The memory of Arthur Vale's last moments was still fresh in his mind, the pain and the fear still raw. But he couldn't afford to dwell on it. He had to stay focused, had to keep moving forward.

He opened his eyes and looked back at the screen. The data was there, clear and undeniable. He had the proof he needed. Now, he just had to make sure it got into the right hands.

He stood up, stretching his stiff muscles. The floor creaked beneath his feet, a sound that seemed too loud in the silence. He walked over to the window and pulled back the curtain, just enough to see outside. The street was empty, the buildings dark. It was late, and the city was quiet.

He let the curtain fall back into place and turned back to the laptop. He had work to do. He had to prepare the evidence, make sure it was airtight. He couldn't afford any mistakes.

He sat back down and got to work, his fingers flying over the keyboard. The data was complex, but he was methodical. He isolated the key pieces of evidence, the fragments that would tell the story. He annotated each one, making sure the connections were clear.

As he worked, he could feel the adrenaline fading, replaced by a cold, hard determination. He was no longer just a man in a safe house, a fugitive hiding from the law. He was a man on a mission, a man with a purpose.

He finished the last of the annotations and leaned back in his chair, satisfied. The evidence was ready. Now, he just had to wait for Anya's response.

He checked his watch. It was almost midnight. He knew he should get some sleep, but he couldn't bring himself to stop. He was too close now, too close to the truth.

He stood up and walked over to the small kitchenette. He poured himself a glass of water, the sound of the tap filling the silence. He drank it down, the cold liquid soothing his throat.

He set the glass down and walked back to the laptop. He opened a new document and started to type, outlining the next steps. He had to be careful, had to plan every move. One wrong step, and it would all be over.

He worked for hours, the night stretching out before him. The city outside was quiet, the only sound the distant hum of traffic. But in the safe house, the air was thick with tension, the weight of the truth pressing down on him.

He finally finished the outline and leaned back in his chair, exhausted. He knew he should get some sleep, but he couldn't bring himself to stop. He was too close now, too close to the truth.

He stood up and walked over to the window again, pulling back the curtain just enough to see outside. The street was still empty, the buildings still dark. It was late, and the city was quiet.
