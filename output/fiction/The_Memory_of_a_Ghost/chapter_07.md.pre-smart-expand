Chapter 7: A Deal with the Devil

CHAPTER 7: A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL

The rain had stopped, leaving the city glistening under a bruised, twilight sky. Leo stood before the austere steel-and-glass monolith of Rourke Consolidated, his reflection a ghost in the darkening facade. The detail from the crime scene photo was a brand behind his eyes: a single, high-resolution thread of wool, navy blue, caught on the rough edge of Croft’s antique desk. It matched, with microscopic precision, the bespoke fabric of the suit jacket Simon Rourke had worn the day Leo first met him in Thorne’s office. A thread Thorne’s investigators had missed, the police had overlooked, but which Leo’s HSAM had snagged on, pulling until the entire tapestry of lies began to unravel.

The lobby was a cathedral to cold capital. The air smelled of ozone and floor polish. A silent elevator whisked him to the penthouse, its motion so smooth it felt like standing still while the world fell away. When the doors sighed open, he was not in an office, but a living space of terrifying minimalism. One entire wall was glass, overlooking the city’s electric sprawl. The only furnishings were a low slate table and two chairs that looked like sculpted bone. Simon Rourke stood at the window, his back to Leo, a silhouette against the dying light.

“Mr. Vane,” he said, without turning. “I wondered when you’d come. The thread, was it?”

Leo’s breath hitched. The admission was so casual, so complete, it stole his momentum. “You knew I’d see it.”

“Thorne said your memory was photographic. A regrettable oversight on my part. I should have had the suit burned.” Rourke finally turned. He wore a charcoal sweater and trousers, looking like a retired academic, not a titan of industry. His face was calm, almost kindly. It was the eyes that betrayed him—flat, assessing, like chips of obsidian. “Would you like a drink? Something to steady the nerves. This must be… disorienting.”

“I don’t want a drink. Why did you kill Arthur Croft?”

Rourke gestured to a chair. Leo remained standing. With a faint shrug, Rourke settled into the other chair, steepling his fingers. “Croft was a sentimental fool. He was going to scuttle the merger over ‘ethical concerns.’ A nine-figure deal, years in the making, undone by a pang of conscience.” He said the word like it was a peculiar flavor. “He threatened to go public with some of our… more aggressive acquisition strategies. It wasn’t business. It was suicide.”

“So you stabbed him with a letter opener.”

“It was impulsive,” Rourke conceded, as if discussing a minor golfing error. “He turned his back. The implement was there. It felt… efficient. The mess, however, was not. A problem presented itself. I am a man of considerable visibility. My absence from a charity gala that evening would have been noted. I needed to be in two places at once.”

Leo’s mind raced, piecing it together. “The alibi. Evelyn Caine.”

A genuine smile touched Rourke’s lips. “Ah, Evelyn. A wonderful, malleable woman. She wor
