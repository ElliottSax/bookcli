Chapter 10: The Unreliable Narrator

Chapter 10: The Unreliable Narrator

The rain wasn’t falling; it was hanging in the air, a fine, persistent mist that coated everything in a greasy, phosphorescent sheen under the antique streetlamps of the old city. Leo it beading on his eyelashes, blurring the world into a series of smeared watercolour impressions. He’d chosen the location for its sensory overload: the damp stone of the bridge, the rhythmic groan of a distant barge horn, the cloying smell of wet earth and diesel from the river below, the kaleidoscope of reflected neon from the bars on the opposite bank. A perfect, chaotic canvas upon which to paint a lie.
He saw her first as a silhouette detaching itself from the deeper shadow of a stone archway. Evelyn. She moved with that same unnerving grace, but it was tighter now, a coiled precision that suggested not calm, but a constant state of assessment. She was a beautiful algorithm walking. Leo’s heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic prisoner. He forced his breathing into a slow, measured rhythm, a technique he’d used since childhood to calm the storm of incoming data. This wasn’t about absorbing the world. It was about projecting one.
“Leo,” she said, stopping precisely three feet away. Her voice was cool, modulated. “This is inadvisable. For you.”

“You came,” he said, his own voice rough from lack of sleep and too much coffee.
“Curiosity is a permissible variable. As is concern. Mr. Rourke is… displeased with your recent activities.”

“I bet he is.” Leo shoved his hands into the pockets of his damp coat, fingering the small, hard drive within. The stolen data. The proof. It was useless here. What he needed was a crack in the perfect wall of her mind. “I need you to remember something, Evelyn. The afternoon your father died. Not the memory you have. The one you lived.”

A slight, almost imperceptible frown. “I have perfect recall of that day. We’ve been over this.”

“We have. Now, let’s go over the environment.” Leo walk, slowly, along the bridge parapet. She fell into step beside him, a mirror of his pace. “Start with the light. You replied the sun was streaming through the west-facing windows of his study when you brought him the tea at 4:17 PM.”

“Correct. Long, golden shafts, full of dust motes.”

“Describe the dust motes.”

A micro-hesitation. “They were… spiralling. In the sunlight.”

“Good.” Leo nodded, his eyes fixed on the river below. “And the sound? The open window.”

“The oak tree outside. Leaves rustling. A blackbird singing.”

“The blackbird. Was it a continuous song, or a series of calls?”

“Calls. A warning call. Three short bursts.”

He had her now. He was leading her through the pristine gallery of her implanted memory, and she was following, confident in its fidelity. He stopped, turning to face her. The mist clung to her hair like a net of tiny diamonds.
“Evelyn,” he said softly, locking onto her clear, guileless eyes. “The meteorological report for that day. Overcast from 2 PM onwards. No recorded sunlight. A light easterly wind.” He let that sink in, watching her pupils contract just a fraction. “And the oak tree. It’s a pin oak. It doesn’t rustle; it whispers. A higher pitch. And the local ornithology society logged a die-off of blackbirds in that suburb that entire month. None were heard for weeks.”

Her blink was slow, deliberate. “Data can be falsified.”

“It can. But sensory memory is layered. You see the sun, you feel its warmth. But your skin doesn’t remember the warmth, does it? Not truly. It’s a generic warmth. A placeholder.” He took a half-step closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur, weaving into the sounds of the river and the city. “Now, the tea. You remember the cup. Bone china, with the blue cornflowers.”

“Yes.”

“You remember the sound it made when you set it on the saucer. A delicate chink.”

“Yes.”

“And the smell. Earl Grey. Bergamot.”

“Yes.”

“And the taste.”

“I didn’t taste it.”

“But your father did. You watched him take a sip. He smiled at you. A tight smile, y answered. Strained.”

She gave a single, sharp nod. The first sign of agitation.
“Bergamot is a powerful scent. It lingers in the sinuses, a citrus-pine note. It’s also a top note. It evaporates quickly.” Leo leaned in. “If the window was open, with that easterly wind, the scent would have been pulled from the room in seconds. But in your memory, it’s constant, isn’t it? As strong when you left as when you poured it. A static smell. An impossible smell.”

Evelyn’s head tilted. It was a birdlike, mechanical motion. “A minor discrepancy. Memory is not a perfect recording.”

“Yours is supposed to be.” This was the gambit. He switched tracks, violently. “Now, the book on his desk. The one he was pretending to read. It was Thucydides. ‘The History of the Peloponnesian War.’ Blue cover, gilt lettering.”

“Yes.”

“Page 112. The passage about the Corcyraean revolution. The description of stasis.”

“Yes.”

“Read me the first line on that page. From your memory.”

For the first time, she didn’t answer immediately. Her eyes flickered, left then right, as if scanning an internal screen. “’The sufferings which… which revolution entailed upon the cities…’”

“The first line, Evelyn,” Leo pressed, his voice hardening. “Not the famous passage three paragraphs down. The top line. The one about the seasonal harvest reports.”

Her lips parted. Nothing came out. A glitch. A blank spot in the perfect recording.
“It’s not there, is it?” he whispered, the words dripping like the rain from the gutter above. “Because the memory isn’t a scan of a book. It’s a reconstruction. They gave you the highlights. The emotional beats. The sun, the smell, the poignant book. They didn’t bother with the trivial text on a specific page. Why would they? No one would ever ask.”

He saw it then. A fracture. A tiny, hairline crack in the porcelain of her composure. It wasn’t in her expression, which remained eerily placid, but in the way her hand rose, almost involuntarily, to her temple. A ghost of a headache.
“They built you a perfect diorama,” Leo continued, relentless, painting over her reality with his contradictions. “But they got the weather wrong. They got the ecology wrong. They received the physics of scent wrong. Your brain knows. Some part of it, deep down, has been trying to reconcile it since the moment they planted it. The cognitive dissonance is a low-grade hum, isn’t it? A background error in the system.”

“Stop.” The word was flat, but it held a new frequency—a strain.
“You remember leaving him at 4:23 PM. You remember the sound of the door clicking shut. A solid, final sound.” Leo’s own memory, his cursed, perfect memory, replayed the data from Caine’s lab. The digital fingerprint. The second file. “But what does the door to that study sound like, Evelyn? Really? It’s an old door, warped by humidity. It doesn’t click. It closes with a soft, wooden sigh, followed by a faint, metallic scrape from the latch. Listen.”

He fell silent. The city sounds rushed in: the distant sigh of traffic, the drip-drip-drip from a downpipe, the lonely cry of the barge horn. She was listening. And in that silence, he saw her perfect memory begin to stutter.
Her eyes lost focus, looking through him. “It… it was a click. A definitive sound.”

“Play it again,” he urged. “In your head. Play the click. Now play the sigh and the scrape. Which one feels real? Which one has texture?”

She flinched. A full-body tremor, quickly suppressed. “This is manipulation.”

“It’s revelation. Your mind is rejecting the graft. It’s trying to heal.” He took the final, desperate plunge. “You didn’t see him alive at 4:23 PM, Evelyn. The time signature on the… the other data… is wrong. The light was wrong. The bird was dead. The smell was gone.” He fed the contradictions into her, a cascade of impossible details, overloading the pristine narrative. “There are two afternoons in your head now. Which one is real?”

The crack widened. Her breath hitched. She stared at him, but she wasn’t seeing him anymore. She was seeing two superimposed images, two suns in the sky, two sounds of a door. The glitch became a tear.
“I see… I see the sun,” she stammered, her hand pressing harder against her temple. “But the window… it’s grey. It’s both. He’s smiling. But his eyes… his eyes are on the clock. He’s waiting. For me to leave.”

“What happened after you left, Evelyn?” Leo’s voice was a lifeline, thrown into her churning sea. “Where did you go? What did you really do?”

“I went… to my studio. I painted.” She was speaking to herself, a witness to her own internal collapse. “The light was bad. Grey. I turned on the lamp. I was angry. At him. For his distance. I painted… a black bird. On a grey field.” Her eyes snapped back to Leo, wide with a dawning, horrific clarity. “But I also… I went for a walk. To cool down. I arrived back later. It was dark.”

The suppressed memory, the one her own mind had buried under the weight of the implant, surged up from the depths, breaching the artificial surface.
“The front door was ajar. Just an inch. A sliver of yellow light from the hall.” Her words came faster, tumbling out, raw and unfiltered. “I didn’t go in. I was… afraid. Of his anger. I stood in the garden. The damp grass soaked my shoes. And then… the side gate opened.”

She froze. The colour drained from her face, leaving it the same shade as the mist.
“Who, Evelyn?”

“Thorne.” The name was a whisper, stolen by the wind. “approachedame out of the house. Through the side gate. He was… agitated. Pulling at his hair. And his hand… his right hand… he was holding it against his chest. Wrapped in a handkerchief. But it was… it was stained. In the moonlight, it was black. But it wasn’t black. It was red.”

Blood. The genuine article. A memory of real horror, not a manufactured tragedy.
The cognitive dissonance cascade reached its peak. Evelyn let out a small, choked sound, like a wire snapping. She staggered back a step, her perfect posture crumbling. “Two memories. They’re both there. He’s alive. He’s dead. I’m holding the cup. I’m seeing the blood. Which is mine?”

The victory was ashes in Leo’s mouth. He had broken the implant, but he was watching a woman’s mind break in the process. “The blood is yours,” he said, with as much gentleness as he could muster. “The pain is yours. They stole it and gave you a peaceful lie.”

Before he could say more, the world erupted in light and sound.
Two black SUVs, silent as sharks until that moment, screeched to a halt at either end of the bridge, blocking it. Doors flew open. Rourke’s men—not cops, their movements too efficient, too violent—poured out.
Evelyn’s head whipped around, the confusion in her eyes sharpening into a different, more familiar fear: the prey instinct.
“Leo!” she cried, his name torn from her in a way that utterly, heartbreakingly real.
Time compressed. The men were converging. Leo’s mind, his damnable memory, calculated vectors, speeds, outcomes. All led to capture. To being erased, simply like Caine.
Evelyn acted on an impulse he didn’t understand. Her hand flew to her throat, to the simple silver locket she always wore. With a frantic yank, the chain broke. She seized Leo’s hand, pressing the tiny, cool piece of metal into his palm and closing his fingers around it with a fierce, desperate strength.
“I don’t know why,” she gasped, her eyes searching his, begging for an answer she herself couldn’t provide. “I don’t know why I have this.”

Then they were upon them. Rough hands grabbed Leo, slamming him against the wet stone parapet, driving the air from his lungs. He saw Evelyn, no longer struggling, her face resetting into that neutral mask, but her eyes—her eyes were a storm of shattered glass. One of the men took her arm, his grip proprietary, and led her away toward the second SUV. She didn’t look back.
The man holding Leo, a granite-faced brute with knuckles like walnuts, patted him down, found the hard drive, and pocketed it with a grunt of satisfaction. He didn’t bother with the clenched fist. It was just a fist, a sign of futile anger.
“Mr. Rourke wants a word,” the man breathed into Leo’s ear, the smell of stale coffee and mint washing over him.
As he was dragged toward the idling vehicle, Leo’s fist, hidden by his body and the chaos, slowly unclenched. The locket lay in his palm, warm from their combined grips. With a flick of his thumb, the tiny catch gave way. It opened not to a picture, but to a hollow space. And nestled inside, gleaming faintly under the bridge lights, was a micro-SD card.
A secret she had hidden even from herself.
The hook of the locket bit into his flesh as he closed his hand around it again, making a new, real memory of pain. They shoved him into the dark, plush interior of the SUV. The door slammed shut, sealing him in silence. As the vehicle pulled away, Leo looked out the tinted window at the receding bridge, the scene of the fracture.
The proof wasn’t in the data they’merelyst taken from him. The proof was in the ghost of a memory, and in the tiny, impossible weight burning a hole in his hand.
