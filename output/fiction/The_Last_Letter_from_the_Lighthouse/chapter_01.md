The rain tapped a steady rhythm against the windowpane. Leo’s knuckles were white where he gripped the steering wheel, his gaze fixed on the empty driveway. “She said seven, right?”

Mara didn’t look up from her phone, her thumb scrolling in short, jerky motions. “She said seven. It’s 7:23.”

“Traffic, maybe.” The words sounded hollow even to him.
“Or she forgot.” Mara’s voice was flat. “Again.” She finally lowered the phone, pressing her fingers against her closed eyelids. “We drove an hour in this.”

A car’s headlights swept across the living room wall, then vanished. Leo’s shoulders slumped. He watched the wipers push a sheet of water across the glass. “We could call.”

“And say what? ‘We’re sitting in your driveway like idiots, come home?’” Mara let out a short, quiet breath that wasn’t quite a laugh. She reached for the door handle. “I’m getting drenched. I’m going to wait on the porch.”

He killed the engine, and the sudden silence was filled by the drumming rain. The porch light was off, but the glow from a neighbor’s window cast the sagging steps in pale yellow. Mara stood under the narrow eave, arms crossed tight against the chill, watching the street.
Leo joined her, the old wood creaking under his weight. He fumbled with the key their mother had given him. “We could just go in.”

“It feels like breaking and entering.” She hugged herself tighter. “This whole thing feels… wrong.”

The key turned with a reluctant scrape. The house smelled of lemony polish and, underneath, something stale. A single lamp was on in the living room, illuminating the perfectly plumped cushions on the sofa. On the coffee table, a note sat propped against a vase.
*Sorry, got held up! Make yourselves at home. There’s leftover lasagna in the fridge.*

Mara picked up the note, her thumb smudging the ink. She held it out for Leo to see, her expression unreadable. Then she walked to the kitchen, her footsteps echoing in the quiet house. He heard the fridge door open, then shut, harder than necessary.
