Outside, the storm raged, its fury a perfect mirror to the turmoil brewing inside Elara. Frozen in place, she let her sodden coat slip to the floor, staring at the man before her. Fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows that danced and leapt across the walls. Warmth filled the room, yet a chill traced its way down her spine at the sight of the stranger standing there.

Silas—no, Leo—locked eyes with her, and for a moment, she drowned in their depths. The weight of the truth pressed down, making each breath a struggle. Ten years believing him dead, ten years burying grief, guilt, and love. Now he stood alive, his presence a physical ache beneath her ribs.

Her mouth opened, but words tangled in her throat. What could she say? How to explain the maelstrom of emotions? Trapped in a nightmare, she couldn’t wake. Outside, the storm grew louder, thunder booming in her ears as she fought for her voice.

Leo turned, his expression unreadable. Firelight flickered across his face, deepening the hollows beneath his cheeks and the lines around his eyes. He looked older, harder—the boy she had loved worn away by time and secrets. An ache bloomed in her chest as her eyes drank in every detail: the lines etched into his skin, the weight of his secrets, the pain that seemed to seep from every pore.

“I never meant for you to find out like this,” he said, his voice low and rough. The words cut through the air, striking her with precision. Anger and betrayal flared, then dissolved into a deep, hollow sadness.

“You thought what?” Elara demanded, her voice sharp with pain. The words tumbled out, a jumbled mess. She was screaming, but her voice emerged barely audible. The room seemed to shrink, the walls closing in as she gazed at Leo.

He flinched at the word *loved*, as if struck. The sight made her chest tighten, tears welling. She was losing him all over again, reliving the agony of his departure.

“I’m not that man anymore, Elara,” he whispered. The words hung heavy with unspoken meaning, threatening to pull her under.

“Then who are you?” Her voice trembled. The question sliced through the air, bringing with it a pang of fear and uncertainty.

He turned away, running a hand through his damp hair—a gesture of surrender. Sadness and loss washed over her.

“Silas is the man who survived,” he said, his back to her. The words whispered through the room like a gentle breeze, raising goosebumps along her arms.

Silence stretched between them, thick and heavy. A frantic drumbeat echoed in her ears. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to demand answers, but her feet remained rooted to the floor.

“Why?” The word was barely a breath, a plea to the universe for explanation. Answers remained just out of reach, like distant stars.

He turned, his eyes dark with pain. “Because I had to,” he said, his voice raw. The words cut deep, reigniting anger and betrayal before they melted into that same profound sadness.

“Because I couldn’t stay,” he continued. “Because I couldn’t face you, because I couldn’t face the truth.”

Again, silence settled, dense and loaded. That frantic drumbeat pulsed in her ears. She wanted to reach out, to offer comfort, but paralysis held her fast.

“What truth?” Her voice shook. The question rustled through the quiet like a faint wind.

He looked away, jaw clenched—a gesture of defiance. Sadness and loss tightened their grip.

“The truth that I failed,” he whispered, the words barely audible. They brushed against the stillness like a sigh.

“The truth that I couldn’t save him.” The words cut the air with surgical precision. Anger flashed, then dissolved into deep sorrow.

Her breath caught. The weight of his secrets threatened to pull her under. She wanted to reach out, to offer solace, but her limbs refused to obey.

“Who?” A whisper, a prayer for revelation. Answers still hovered beyond her grasp.

He nodded, his eyes pools of pain—a gesture of surrender. Sadness and loss ached within her.

“Your father,” he breathed, the words a faint rustle in the quiet.

Elara’s breath hitched. Drowning, she fought against the tide of his secrets threatening to consume her. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to comfort him, but she was frozen, her feet rooted to the floor.

“Why?” she asked, her voice trembling. The question was like a prayer, a plea to the universe to explain the mysteries of Leo's past. Answers remained just out of reach.

He looked away, his jaw clenched. The movement was a gesture of defiance, a sign that he was fighting against the truth. A pang of sadness, of loss, tightened in her chest as she gazed at him.

“Because I was too late,” he said, his voice barely audible. The words were a whisper, a gentle breeze that rustled the leaves of her heart. A shiver ran down her spine.

The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken meaning. A frantic drumbeat echoed in her ears. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to demand answers, but she was frozen, her feet rooted to the floor.

“Leo—” she whispered, his name a plea on her lips.

He turned to face her, his eyes dark with pain. The movement was a gesture of surrender. A pang of sadness, of loss, gripped her as she gazed at him.

“I’m not Leo anymore,” he said, his voice raw. The words were a knife, cutting through the air and striking her with precision. Anger and betrayal flared, then dissolved into a deep sadness.

“I’m Silas. And I’m sorry.”

The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken meaning. A frantic drumbeat echoed in her ears. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to comfort him, but she was frozen.ozen, her feet rooted to the floor.

“Silas,” she whispered, his name a plea on her lips. The words were like a prayer, a plea to the universe to explain the mysteries of Leo's past. Elara felt like she was searching for answers in the stars, but they remained just out of reach.

He turned away, his back to her. The movement was like a gesture of defiance, a sign that he was fighting against the truth. Elara felt a pang of sadness, of loss, as she gazed at him.

“I should go,” he said, his voice barely audible. The words were like a whisper, a gentle breeze that rustled the leaves of Elara's heart. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed at Leo.

Elara's heart ached with a pain she had not felt in years. The grief, the guilt, the love—all of it came rushing back, a tidal wave of emotion that threatened to drown her. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to comfort him, but she was frozen, her feet rooted to the floor.

“Please,” she whispered, her voice barely a whisper. The words were like a prayer, a plea to the universe to explain the mysteries of Leo's past. Elara felt like she was searching for answers in the stars, but they remained just out of reach.

He turned to face her, his eyes dark with pain. The movement was like a gesture of surrender, a sign that he was giving up. Elara felt a pang of sadness, of loss, as she gazed at him.

“I have to,” he said, his voice raw. The words were like a knife, cutting through the air and striking Elara with precision. She felt a pang of anger, of betrayal, but it was quickly replaced by a deep sadness.

“I have to go before I say something I can’t take back.”

The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken meaning. Elara's heart pounded in her chest, the beat echoing in her ears. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to demand answers, but she was frozen, her feet rooted to the floor.

The storm raged on outside, its fury a perfect mirror to the turmoil brewing inside Elara. She stood frozen, her sodden coat slipping to the floor as she stared at the stranger who stood before her. The fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the walls as the flames danced and leapt. The room was warm, but Elara felt a chill run down her spine as she gazed at Leo.

The silence between them was oppressive, a heavy weight that pressed down on Elara's chest. She felt like she was drowning, the weight of Leo's secrets threatening to consume her. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to comfort him, but she was frozen, her feet rooted to the floor.
