Outside, the storm raged, its fury matching the turmoil brewing inside Elara. She stood frozen, her sodden coat slipping to the floor, as she stared at the man before her. The fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the walls. The room was warm, but a chill ran down her spine as she looked at the stranger.
Silas - no, Leo - locked eyes with her, and for a moment, she lost in their depths. The truth was almost too much to bear, making each breath a struggle. For ten years, she had believed him dead, burying her grief, guilt, and love. Now he stood alive, his presence a physical ache beneath her ribs.
Her mouth opened, but words got stuck in her throat. What could she say? How could she explain the turmoil of emotions inside her? She trapped in a nightmare, unable to wake up. The storm outside grew louder, thunder booming in her ears as she fought to find her voice.
Leo turned, his expression unreadable. The firelight danced across his face, deepening the hollows beneath his cheeks and the lines around his eyes. He looked older, harder - the boy she had loved was gone, worn away by time and secrets. A pang of sadness hit her chest as she took in every detail: the lines on his skin, the pain in his eyes.
"I never meant for you to find out like this," he said, his voice low and rough. His words cut through the air, striking her with precision. Anger and betrayal flared up, then gave way to a deep sadness.
"You thought what?" Elara demanded, her voice sharp with pain. The words tumbled out, a jumbled mess. She was screaming, but her voice was barely audible. The room appeared to shrink, the walls closing in as she glanced at Leo.
He flinched at the word "loved", as if he had been struck. The sight made her chest tighten, tears welling up. She like she was losing him all over again, reliving the agony of his departure.
"I'm not that man anymore, Elara," he whispered. His words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken meaning.
"Then who are you?" Her voice trembled. The question cut through the air, bringing with it a pang of fear and uncertainty.
He turned away, running a hand through his damp hair. Sadness and loss washed over her.
"Silas is the man who survived," he said, his back to her. His words were barely audible, but they sent shivers down her arms.
The silence between them was thick and heavy. A frantic drumbeat echoed in her ears. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to demand answers, but her feet rooted to the floor.
"Why?" she whispered, a plea for explanation. Answers seemed just out of reach.
He turned, his eyes dark with pain. "Because I had to," he replied, his voice raw. His words cut deep, reigniting anger and betrayal before giving way to sadness.
"Because I couldn't stay," he continued. "Because I couldn't face you, because I couldn't face the truth."

Again, silence settled between them, dense and loaded. The drumbeat pulsed in her ears. She wanted to reach out, to offer comfort, but she was frozen.
"What truth?" Her voice shook. The question rustled through the quiet.
He looked away, his jaw clenched. Sadness and loss tightened their grip on her.
"The truth that I failed," he whispered, his words barely audible.
"The truth that I couldn't save him." His words cut through the air, precise and painful. Anger flashed, then gave way to deep sorrow.
Her breath caught. The weight of his secrets threatened to overwhelm her. She wanted to reach out, to offer solace, but her limbs refused to move.
He nodded, his eyes pools of pain. Sadness and loss ached within her.
"Your father," he breathed, his words a faint whisper.
Elara's breath hitched. She like she was drowning, fighting against the tide of his secrets. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to comfort him, but she was frozen.
"Why?" she asked, her voice trembling. The question was a plea for explanation. Answers remained just out of reach.
Hegazedd away, his jaw clenched. A pang of sadness tightened in her chest as she gazed at him.
"Because I was too late," he said, his voice barely audible. A shiver ran down her spine.
The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken meaning. The drumbeat echoed in her ears. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to demand answers, but she was frozen, her feet rooted to the floor.
“Leo—” she whispered, his name a plea on her lips.
He turned to face her, his eyes dark with pain. The movement was a gesture of surrender. A pang of sadness, of loss, gripped her as she gazed at him.
“I’m not Leo anymore,” answeredaid, his voice raw. The words were a knife, cutting through the air and striking her with precision. Anger and betrayal flared, then dissolved into a deep sadness.
“I’m Silas. And I’m sorry.”

“Silas,” she whispered, his name a plea on her lips. The words were like a prayer, a plea to the universe to explain the mysteries of Leo's past. Elara like she was searching for answers in the stars, but they remained simply out of reach.
He turned away, his back to her. The movement was like a gesture of defiance, a sign that he was fighting against the truth. Elara pang of sadness, of loss, as she gazed at him.
“I should go,” he said, his voice barely audible. The words were like a whisper, a gentle breeze that rustled the leaves of Elara's heart. She shiver run down her spine as she gazed at Leo.
Elara's heart ached with a pain she had not in years. The grief, the guilt, the love—all of it came rushing back, a tidal wave of emotion that threatened to drown her. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to comfort him, but she was frozen, her feet rooted to the floor.

“I have tmurmuredhe said, his voice raw. The words were like a knife, cutting through the air and striking Elara with precision. She pang of anger, of betrayal, but it was quickly replaced by a deep sadness.
“I have to go before I say something I can’t take back.”

The storm raged on outside, its fury a perfect mirror to the turmoil brewing inside Elara. She stood frozen, her sodden coat slipping to the floor as she stared at the stranger who stood before her. The fire crackled and spat, casting flickering shadows on the walls as the flames danced and leapt. The room was warm, but Elara chill run down her spine as she gazed at Leo.
The silence between them was oppressive, a heavy weight that pressed down on Elara's chest. She like she was drowning, the weight of Leo's secrets threatening to consume her. She wanted to reach out, to touch him, to comfort him, but she was frozen, her feet rooted to the floor.
