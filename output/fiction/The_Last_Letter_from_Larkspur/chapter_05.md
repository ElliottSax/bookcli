Chapter 5: His Side of the Story

Chapter 5: His Side of the Story

The envelope was heavier than it should have been. It felt, in Elara’s hands, like a geological specimen, a sedimentary rock composed of compressed years. She carried it from the festival’s closing reception back to her rented room above the bookshop, the noise of the crowd fading into the hushed, dusty quiet of the space. A single lamp cast a buttery pool of light on the worn oak desk. Outside, the first stars pricked the violet shell of the sky over Larkspur.

For a long time, she simply sat, the envelope before her. Leo had pressed it into her hand as they parted outside the workshop tent, his fingers brushing hers—a touch that was no longer the confident possession of youth, but something tentative, freighted. “My side,” he’d said, his voice low. “It’s all in there. You don’t have to read it. But it’s yours.”

His side. For a decade, his side had been a monolith in her mind: a cold, selfish betrayal, etched in the stark relief of another woman’s perfume on his collar, the evasive shift of his eyes. It was a story she had curated, polished to a hard, brilliant finish in her first novel, The Unspoken Place. She had written him as Julian: charming, brilliant, ultimately hollow. Writing him had been an exorcism. Or so she’d believed.

Now, after this strange day—after seeing the grey at his temples, the new carefulness in his gestures, after hearing him quote her own anonymous letters back to her with a reverence that shook her—the monolith had cracks. And light, a terrifying, curious light, was seeping through.

She broke the seal. The paper inside was thick, cream-colored, covered in his familiar, precise script. But it was not a single letter. Atop the sheaf of pages lay a smaller, cardstock item. A ticket. “The Glasshouse Tour: Midnight Blooming of the Selenicereus grandiflorus, The Queen of the Night. Private Viewing. Saturday, 11:30 PM. Meet at the Orchid Pavilion.” This Saturday. Two days from now. Her breath caught. The Queen of the Night—a cactus that bloomed, extravagantly and fragrantly, for a single night before withering at dawn. A silent plea, indeed.

Beneath the ticket, the letter began.

Elara,

If you are reading this, you have not thrown it into the first fire you found. For that, I am more grateful than I can express. I write this not to exonerate myself—there is no exoneration for the hurt I caused—but because you deserve the truth, however poorly it reflects upon the man I was.

I have begun a hundred letters to you over the years. All ended in the wastebasket, ashes of cowardice. It was only after reading The Unspoken Place, and then, miraculously, finding your voice again in those beautiful, anonymous letters to the world, that I found the courage—or perhaps the desperation—to try.

The scent of the paper was faintly of old books and, inexplicably, of petrichor. She brought it closer to her face, then felt foolish. But the smell was there, a ghost of the storms that used to roll over the hills of their university town, sending them running for shelter into the dusty sanctuary of the library.

You asked me today, with a fury I wholly deserved, why I did it. The simple, ugly answer is fear. But not fear of commitment, as you must have believed. It was the slow, corrosive fear of becoming irrelevant to you.

Do you remember the night you won the Caldwell Prize? You were twenty-two. I had just scraped a pass on my botany mid-term, my head aching from the Latin names of mosses, while you were being hailed as the most promising young writer of your generation. The ceremony was in that grand, gilded hall. You wore a simple green dress, and when you read your excerpt, the room didn’t just fall silent—it ceased to exist. There was only you, and the world you were spinning from language. I stood at the back, a proud boyfriend. And I was proud, Elara, so fiercely proud it hurt my chest. But later, at the party, I saw how people looked at me. “The boyfriend,” they’d say, before turning back to you. I was an appendage. A footnote.

That night, you were buzzing, alive with ideas for your novel. You talked about structure, about voice, about renting a cottage in Scotland to write. I listened, and all I could think was: Where do I fit in this glorious future? I, who could name every lichen on a gravestone but couldn’t string a sentence together that didn’t sound clinical. My love for you was the biggest thing I had ever felt, but next to your talent, it felt small. Unremarkable.

The fear grew like a weed. It choked me. I began to see every hour you spent writing as an hour you were outgrowing me. Every compliment you received was a brick in a wall between us. I convinced myself I was holding you back. That my steady, earth-bound nature was a anchor on your soaring ship. The thought of you one day realizing this, of looking at me with pity or, worse, polite indifference, was unendurable. So, in a act of spectacular, selfish cowardice, I decided to control the narrative. I would be the villain, and you would be free.

Elara’s hand trembled. She had to set the page down. She stared at the water stain on the ceiling, seeing not the cracked plaster but Leo’s face that last semester—the distracted frown, the way he’d sometimes pull back from her kiss as if burned. She’d interpreted it as fading love, the pull of another. She’d never seen it as a panic attack of the soul.

Clara was not my lover. She was, and is, a friend from my conservation program. A kind, no-nonsense person who thought I was having a mental breakdown (I was). I asked her to meet me at the café where I knew you’d come looking. I staged the entire, tawdry scene. The intimate lean, the hand on her arm. I saw you in the doorway, your face collapsing, and I have carried the image of it like a shard of glass in my heart every day since. I thought it would be a clean break. A sharp pain, then healing. I was an idiot. I inflicted a wound that festered for us both.

A sound escaped her—a half-gasp, half-sob. The ‘other woman’. Clara. She had a name now, and a context. Not a rival, but a prop in Leo’s pathetic, tragic play. The anger that rose was hot, but it was different. It wasn’t the clean, righteous fury at betrayal; it was a messy, complicated storm of rage at his stupidity, his arrogance, his profound underestimation of her and of their love.

She read on, the words now swimming.

I left. I took the field position in Costa Rica, thinking distance and strange flora would scour me clean. It didn’t. The jungle was full of you. The green of certain leaves was the green of your eyes. The silence at night was your absence. I came back two years later, hollowed out. And then, in a airport bookstore, I saw it: The Unspoken Place. Your face on the back cover, older, wiser, beautiful. I bought it and read it on the flight home in a state of exquisite agony.

You had written us. You had written me. Julian was so perfectly, painfully me—the charming cad, the intellectual thief, the man who could not bear the weight of a real woman’s heart. You captured my mannerisms, my turns of phrase, with devastating accuracy. But reading it, I realized you had only ever seen the surface of me, the performance I’d given the world. The man who was afraid, who loved you so desperately it broke him, was absent from the page. I had succeeded too well. I had hidden my true self behind a villain’s mask, and you had believed it. I had given you the lie, and you, brilliant creator that you are, had fashioned it into a truth more coherent than reality. It was the most profound loneliness I have ever known.

For years after, I was a ghost. I worked, I existed. I followed your career from a distance, each new book a fresh testament to the life you had built without me. Then, three years ago, I stumbled upon “Letters from Larkspur.” The first one was about the sound of rain on different leaves—tinny on ivy, soft on moss, a drumroll on the magnolia. I knew, with a certainty that stopped my heart. It was you. The voice was different—softer, more open, less armored than your novels—but the essence, the way you saw, was unmistakable. Here was the woman I had fallen in love with: the noticer, the wonderer, the one who found the universe in a dewdrop. You were talking to the world, and I, a haunted man, started listening.

The letters became my air. Your loneliness in them mirrored my own, but it was a loneliness that reached out, that sought connection. I wanted to answer. Not as Leo, the ghost from your past, but as a fellow traveler in the quiet hours. My first letter was a risk. I wrote about the symbiotic relationship between a specific orchid and a moth, a dance of survival so intimate it seemed like love. I posted it from a city miles away, my hands shaking. When you published a response, musing on the nature of invisible bonds, I wept. It was a conversation. A thread, gossamer-thin, across the void.

I never meant for it to become a deception. It was a lifeline. Through our correspondence, I came to know the woman you are now—more resilient, more nuanced, yet still containing the girl who found magic in a dusty library. And I fell in love with you all over again, a love compounded by regret and a depth of understanding I never had at twenty-two. The festival was my final, desperate gamble. I had to see you. I had to offer you the key to the prison I built for us both.

The letter ended not with a request, but a statement.

The ticket is enclosed. It is for the one place I feel most myself, and the one phenomenon that speaks most to our story: a fleeting, breathtaking beauty that happens once in a lifetime, often in the dark. I will be at the Orchid Pavilion on Saturday night at 11:30. I will wait until dawn. If you come, we will talk. If you do not, I will understand. I will cease the letters, and you will never hear from me again. Either way, you have the truth. It is the last, and only, real thing I have to give you.

Yours, in every universe that might have been,
Leo

The final page slipped from her fingers onto the desk. The room was utterly silent, save for the frantic drum of her own heart. She felt unmoored, as if the floorboards had dissolved and she was suspended in the night air. The past ten years were not erased—the pain was too real, too deeply woven into her—but they were suddenly, irrevocably, rearranged.

She thought of his hands that afternoon in the workshop, steady as he demonstrated how to press a fragile fern, his touch both expert and tender. She thought of the way he’d looked at her when he quoted her letter about lost things—not with ownership, but with a kind of awe. She thought of Julian, the caricature she’d crafted from her hurt, and then of Leo, the man who had just handed her a map to his own interior wreckage.

The ticket glinted in the lamplight. The Queen of the Night. A bloom that offered its entire heart for a single, secret night.

For two days, Elara moved through the festival’s final events in a daze. She gave a reading, her voice on autopilot. She signed books, smiling at faces that seemed to swim before her. All the while, the ticket burned a hole in her pocket, and the scent of petrichor from the letter seemed to cling to her skin.

Saturday evening descended, heavy and warm. She stood at the window of her room, watching the sunset bleed into the hills. She had not decided. Every rational fiber told her to stay away. To take his truth, acknowledge its power, and let it be the end. To protect the life she had built, a life that was good, and solid, and hers.

But another part of her, the part that wrote letters to strangers and believed in the language of moths and orchids, was drawn to the precipice. Not for reconciliation—that was a bridge too far, a country on a map she couldn’t read. But for closure of a different kind. To see him in his element, to look the truth in the eye, to witness this rare, nocturnal bloom for herself. To see if the man in the letter matched the ghost in the garden.

At 11:15, she found herself putting on a light sweater. The night air had a chill. She slipped the ticket into her hand.

She walked through the sleeping town, past darkened shop fronts and under the fragrant canopy of linden trees. The festival grounds were quiet, the tents skeletal in the moonlight. She followed a gravel path that wound towards the restored Victorian glasshouses, their panes glowing with a soft, interior light.

The Orchid Pavilion was a smaller, domed structure, a jewel box of humidity and scent. She pushed the heavy door open. The air was a warm, damp kiss, thick with the perfume of earth and a thousand flowers. It was a jungle under glass. Vines trailed from the ironwork, orchids clung to faux trees with roots like grey lace, and the only sound was the gentle drip of water.

And there, in the center, beside a seemingly unremarkable cactus with long, spiny tendrils, stood Leo.

He was looking at the plant, his profile lit by a single, discreet spotlight. He wore a simple linen shirt, sleeves rolled up. He looked, not like a man expecting a miracle, but like a man keeping a vigil. The quiet concentration on his face was the same as when he’d examined a leaf specimen. It was utterly, vulnerably real.

He turned, sensing her. His eyes met hers across the verdant space. No smile, no spoken greeting. Just a slow, deep breath, as if he’d been underwater and had finally broken the surface. In his gaze, she saw the boy from the library, the man who had broken her heart, and the penitent who had written the letter. They were all there, fused.

He simply nodded towards the cactus. “It’s starting,” he said, his voice barely a whisper.

She moved forward, the gravel crunching softly under her feet. She stopped a few feet from him, following his gaze. A large, closed bud at the end of one of the cactus’s arms was trembling. Slowly, with a grace that seemed impossible for such a rugged plant, the outer petals began to unfurl. They were a pale, creamy yellow, peeling back to reveal a heart of pure, luminous white. The scent hit her then—not the cloying sweetness of a rose, but something exotic, intoxicating, a blend of vanilla and citrus and something deeply, mysteriously floral. It was the scent of a secret being told.

They stood in silence as the flower performed its ancient, ephemeral dance. It opened fully, a spectacular, plate-sized bloom, a moon captured on earth. Its beauty was urgent, tragic, magnificent.

“It spends all that energy,” Leo said softly, not looking at her, “for just a few hours. To be seen by the moths that have evolved just for it. It seems like a waste, doesn’t it?”

Elara watched the perfect, white petals. “Or it’s the only thing that makes sense,” she heard herself say. “To be fully what you are, when it’s time.”

He finally turned his head to look at her. The spotlight caught the silver in his hair, the lines of regret and hope around his eyes. “Thank you for coming, Elara.”

She didn’t answer. She was still holding the ticket. She looked from the breathtaking, dying flower to the man who had broken her, and then remade her understanding of the past. The hook was not in his letter, or his ticket. It was here, in this humid, scented dark. It was in the terrifying, open space between them, where a decade of hurt and a single, shared, miraculous bloom now hung in the balance. The conversation had not yet begun. The real question, the one that tightened her throat and quickened her pulse, was no longer about the past.

It was about what, if anything, could possibly bloom in its place.
