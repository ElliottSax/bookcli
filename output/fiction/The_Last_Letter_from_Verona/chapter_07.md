Chapter 7: The Bargain

The storm that had threatened all day broke just as Leo finished speaking, as if the heavens themselves had decided to weigh in on the conversation. Rain, warm and heavy, lashed against the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets.'s tall windows, turning the view of the cypress avenue into a smeared watercolour of grey and green. The sound was a constant, hushed roar, sealing them inside a world that felt both dangerously intimate and impossibly vast with the weight of what had just been said.

Elara stood at the fireplace, her back to him, one hand resting on the carved mantel as if for balance. The flames guttered, casting long, dancing shadows that made the painted cherubs on the ceiling seem to flinch. She could still feel the echo of his words in the quiet room, each one a stone dropped into the still pool of her understanding, sending out ripples that distorted everything she thought she knew.

The air was heavy with the scent of wet stone, the dampness hanging in the air like a shimmering veil that clung to their skin. Elara's damp hair clung to the nape of her neck, her breath coming in quick, ragged gasps as if she herself had been the source of the storm. Leo's voice, low and rough, was like a memoirist detailing the unlived moments of his life.

A marriage of convenience. To save the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets..

He had laid it out with a brutal, administrative clarity. The precipice his family had been on, not just financially but culturally—the threat of losing not only Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets., its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets. but the entire archive, the letters, the history that was their charge. The benefactor, a Milanese industrialist with more money than lineage, and his quiet, agreeable daughter. A transaction, pure and simple. The industrialist's money in exchange for his daughter's title, and the preservation of a crumbling legacy.

The sound of raindrops pounding against the pavement outside created a rhythmic accompaniment to Elara's mental turmoil. Smudged rain tracks traveled along the stone floor, a witness to the tentativeness that had brought them to this place, to this moment of reckoning. The fragments of their shared past, now gunpowder, awaiting the spark that would set them off.

“It was never a marriage,” Leo said, his voice rough from the unspooling. He hadn't moved from the wingback chair, sitting forward, elbows on his knees, staring at the space between the Persian rug and his worn boots. “We shared a roof in Milan for two years. Separate wings. She was as trapped as I was, poor thing. We were… custodians of a contract. It was annulled. Quietly. No one's fault. Just the conclusion of a failed business arrangement.”

Elara finally turned. The firelight caught the sheen in her eyes, but her face was composed, a mask of terrible calm. “When?” The single word was husky, hostage to the renewed sense of desolation that had descended upon her.

“The negotiations began a month after you left for London.” He didn't look up. “The ceremony was three months after that.”

The air left her lungs in a soft, pained rush. She had been in London then, in a cramped, rain-slicked flat, nursing a heartbreak so acute she felt physically ill. She'd written letters she never sent, stared at a silent phone, clung to the fragile hope that his silence was a test, that he would come to his senses. All the while, he had been here, or in Milan, signing papers, selling his future to save these stones and parchments.

The impact of witnessing the loss not just of her own dreams, but of what she now understood to be the narrative she'd thought they shared, reverberated within her like a building falling to its knees. The stone beneath her feet felt unstable.

“You thought cutting me out was kinder?” The calm cracked, a fissure of raw anger. “Leo, you owed me the truth. You owed me the choice! Do you have any idea what I constructed in that silence? That I'd bored you? That our summer was just a… a diversion for you? That I'd somehow misunderstood everything?”

Now he looked up, and the raw anguish in his face was almost too much to bear. It looked like it had clawed its way up from the depths of him, dragging out a desperate attempt at validation. She could almost read the question on his face: How could she not know? How could she not see? The tortured lifetime of secrets that clung to him like a stranger's shroud.

“Why didn't I speak?” she asked, the sound hoarse, crumpling, beneath the pain.

The tension between them the weight of light chains, but one accidental movement would snap them free. It felt like trying to break free from dissolving glue. He thought of the howling voids left in his thoughts where her name had been, years fallen by the wayside, lost like words ripped from sentences. He didn't answer.

“Save me the sanctimony, Leo.” Elara managed, voice cool and telling, chill conclusive in the emotion-defying heat inside her, it coiled here. “Just tell me.”

He started with the knowledge of internal, gnawing conviction. The wildest knowledge that an aphorism 'His justifications were the easiest things to prove.’ He paused, listening to her ragged breathing, grasping into thin air for a liberty most merited to and characterised at overcoming freedom frames in discourse achieved tend claimed interactions retreated far.

Now he looked up, and the raw anguish in his face was almost too much to bear. “What choice could I have given you, Elara? ‘Wait for me while I marry someone else’? ‘Come back to a man who belongs to a ledger sheet’? I was ruined. Not just penniless, but indentured. The shame of it…” He shook his head, a sharp, jerky motion. “I was a shell. I had nothing to offer you but a life of debt and secrecy and disgrace. Letting you go, letting you hate me—that felt like the only clean thing I could do.”

Elara's voice had stilled, her chest tight with the unseen force of the words that had gone unspoken. She covered her mouth with her hand, trying to silence the emotions that surged up like unfiltered anger, curiosity, resentment and anger swaying her. The legacy of their time together hung heavy, breaking her along its insecurities. "We wasted what little we had for costumes that would fit the boundaries of records." She wept quietly.
