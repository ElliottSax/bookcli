Dust in Elara Vance’s studio possessed a specific gravity, a tangible presence more like a collaborator than a contaminant. It hung in the slanted afternoon light, motes dancing above the surgical field of her worktable where a 14th-century psalter lay splayed like a wounded bird. Sheathed in nitrile, her fingers moved with a surgeon’s precision, coaxing a fragment of gold leaf back into alignment with a sable brush so fine it was almost a thought.

The heavy black relic on the far wall shattered the silence on the seventh ring. She didn’t flinch, her focus remaining on the vellum until Leo’s shadow fell across the table. He wiped a smear of adhesive onto his apron.

“Phone for you. A Matteo Russo. Italian lawyer. Insists it’s urgent.”

“Take a message.”

“He mentioned the British Library. A private commission.” Leo shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “Sounds… substantial.”

Her hand hovered. A private commission meant no committees, no stipulations. Slowly, she laid the brush on its rest. “Transfer it to the office.”

The closet-sized room was a sterile haven. She picked up the receiver. “Elara Vance.”

“Signorina Vance. *Grazie mille* for taking my call.” The voice was polished marble, smooth and cool. “I represent a collector, a man of significant means. He possesses a library. A unique one. It has suffered a misfortune—water. It requires the finest conservator in Europe. Your name was the only one provided.”

“And the collection’s focus?” Her thumb traced a small, tight circle on the lacquered desk.

“That is for my client to reveal, should you agree. The scope is extensive. Several hundred volumes, fifteenth to eighteenth century, with some earlier treasures. The work would be on-site. The villa is isolated, near Verona.”

A name surfaced from old conference whispers. “Villa Rossi. The Rossi library. That’s an academic ghost story.”

A beat of silence hummed on the line. “It is not a ghost story. It is stone and paper, and it is bleeding. My client, Conte di Valore, requires discretion and your complete focus. You would reside on the estate. The fee is one hundred and fifty thousand euros. Half to begin, half to conclude, however long it takes. All expenses are, of course, covered.”

The number didn’t just hang in the air; it settled in the room, dense and altering. It was a bulwark against years of uncertainty. And a warning. The cool plastic of the receiver grew warm against her ear.

“Such secrecy invites questions. And Italy has its own experts.”

“The Conte admires your particular objectivity. Your reputation is for the work, not its history. As for secrecy…” A soft, rustling sound, perhaps a shrug. “Some families prefer their shadows to remain undisturbed. Do you require time to consider?”

Through the open door, her studio lay in perfect, knowable order. This offer was a threshold into a fog. But beyond it lay the Rossi collection—a siren’s song of uncatalogued, unseen pages. Her breath caught, a sharp, quiet hitch in her throat.

“No,” she said, the word leaving her lips before she could second-guess. “I don’t need time. Send the contracts.”

Two weeks later, the train from Milan deposited her into the simmering heat of the Veneto. A taciturn driver met her, loading her custom-built conservation case into a dusty Fiat before winding into the hills beyond Verona. The city of lovers faded into a postcard blur, then into wilder, sun-baked landscape. Cypress trees stood like sentinels against a sky of aching blue.

The car slowed, tires crunching on gravel. Through wrought-iron gates sagging on their hinges, she caught her first glimpse of the decaying Rossi villa. It rose from a tangle of overgrown gardens, its ochre walls bleached pale by the sun, its shuttered windows like closed eyes. The driver turned onto the long, cypress-lined drive, and the villa’s shadow fell across the car, cool and deep. It was not grand in the palatial sense, but vast in its melancholy. A faded grandeur clung to the peeling stucco, a whisper of what had been, now swallowed by the silent, watching hills. ochre facade, its plaster cracked and peeling like sunburnt skin. Green shutters, some hanging askew. A terrace strewn with fallen leaves. It was a beautiful face lined with old grief. The car crunched up a gravel drive, weeds clawing through the stone, and stopped. The silence was immediate and profound, broken only by the drone of cicadas. Elara stepped out, the heat wrapping around her. The main door was enormous, oak blackened with age. As she raised a hand to the tarnished knocker, it swung inward. The man who stood there was in his late sixties, lean and wiry, with a face the colour and texture of walnut. He wore a simple work shirt and trousers. “Elara Vance,” he said, not as a question. “I am Giacomo. The caretaker. Come. I show you to your rooms, then the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets..” His English was functional, his manner devoid of warmth. He led her through a cavernous, cool entrance hall, up a marble staircase worn smooth in the center by generations of feet. Her room was on the second floor, high-ceilinged, sparsely furnished with antiques that had known better days. The view from the window was of overgrown formal gardens and, beyond, the hazy blue of the distant hills. It was beautiful, and it felt utterly empty. “The Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. is this way,” Giacomo said, waiting in the hall. He took her to the west wing. The corridor darkened, the air growing cooler, damper. He produced a heavy key, unlocked double doors, and pushed them open. The smell hit her first: the sweet, rotten perfume of moldering paper, the damp, mineral tang of wet stone, the underlying must of profound neglect. Then, the sight. The Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. was a long, high gallery, its walls lined from floor to ceiling with carved oak bookshelves. A mezzanine level ran around three sides, accessed by a slender spiral staircase. But it was a scene of devastation. A large, dark stain bloomed across the far wall and ceiling. A section of the ornate plasterwork had collapsed, leaving a jagged wound open to the lath beneath. Beneath it, a mound of debris— plaster, splintered wood, and the heartbreaking, sodden carcasses of books— lay piled on the floor and across a massive reading table. Water had clearly cascaded down the shelves, leaving tidal marks of warped leather and bloated pages on hundreds of volumes. The air was still, heavy with loss. Elara’s professional mind immediately began assessing, compartmentalizing the disaster into a series of solvable problems: stabilize the environment, remove the debris, triage the collection. But her heart gave a single, hard thud. It was a massacre of history. “When did this happen?” she asked, her voice hushed. “The storm, three months past. A tile went from the roof. The water, it came inside.” Giacomo’s tone was flat, as if describing a minor inconvenience. “And no one has touched anything?” “The Conte said to wait for you.” She walked slowly into the room, her boots whispering on the grit-strewn marble floor. She passed shelves where volumes slumped against one another, their spines cracked, their gilding clouded. She saw a 16th-century herbal, its painted botanicals blurred into ghostly watercolour blooms. A set of Dante, the fine tooling on the leather swollen and distorted. The scale was immense, the damage catastrophic. And yet, amidst the ruin, she saw flashes of sublime beauty: the crisp, unbroken lines of a 1492 Pliny, the rich crimson morocco of a set of French poetry, the glint of gold on a shelf high above. “It’s all here,” she murmured, almost to herself. “The Aldines, the Plantins… legends.” “You know books,” Giacomo said, a faint note of surprise cutting through his reserve. “I know ghosts,” she replied. She turned to him. “I’ll need to set up a workspace. Somewhere with stable temperature and humidity, good light. And I’ll need to meet with Conte di Valore to discuss priorities.” Giacomo’s eyes shifted away, towards a grimy window. “The Conte is not in residence. He communicates through Matteo Russo. You have full authority.” A flicker of frustration ignited in her chest. “I need access to records. A catalogue, even a partial one. I can’t work blind in a collection of this importance.” “There is no catalogue. The old Conte, he knew each book by heart. Since he died…” Giacomo shrugged. “The books just are.” Elara absorbed this. A collection of this magnitude, uncatalogued, was almost unthinkable. It was chaos. It was also, perversely, a kind of paradise. She would be its first cartographer. “Very well,” she said, her resolve hardening. “I’ll start with triage tomorrow. Salvage what we can from the debris pile first.” Giacomo gave a curt nod and left her alone in the silent, wounded room. The next week fell into a rhythm of profound, absorbing labour. Elara commandeered a bright, airy salon on the ground floor for her conservation studio. Giacomo, she discovered, was a man of few words but capable hands, following her precise instructions without complaint. They worked in a wordless partnership, moving the most vulnerable books to a dry area, setting up dehumidifiers, carefully excavating the tragic heap under the collapse. She found wonders in the rubble. A first edition of Petrarch’s Canzoniere, its pages miraculously spared by falling in a closed position. A bundle of 17th-century love letters, the ink still a fierce, passionate black, tucked inside a volume of Ovid. Each discovery was a thrill, a tiny victory against entropy. Yet the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets. itself remained a puzzle. She heard no other voices, saw no evidence of another soul. Only Giacomo, who appeared with simple meals and disappeared into the shadowy recesses of the house. Her questions about Conte di Valore were met with polite, firm deflection. It was on the eighth day, in the deep, quiet hour of the afternoon when the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. was a cathedral of dust and slanting light, that she decided to tackle the core. The books on the shelves directly affected by the leak were a lost cause, but those on the periphery of the water’s path might be saved. She needed to assess them, shelf by shelf. She was on the mezzanine, running a soft brush along the top edge of a row of uniformly bound 18th-century philosophical treatises, when her light caught the spine of something different, shoved to the back of the shelf. It was smaller, bound in a faded blue paper, its spine unmarked. Curious, she carefully worked it out. It was a notebook. A common, cloth-bound thing, the kind a schoolchild might use. It felt light, insubstantial in her gloved hands. She opened it. The handwriting was not old. It was a vigorous, sloping script in dark blue ink. Italian. She could read enough to follow. It was not a catalogue. It was a diary. A personal one. “ Luglio 14. He says the light in the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. in the afternoon is the colour of honey, and that I am too fond of metaphors. I told him metaphors are the only way to speak of some things. Of this. He did not disagree. We did not speak much after that. ” Elara’s breath caught. The intimacy of the entry was a shock in this tomb of silent volumes. She turned a page. “ Agosto 2. Found him asleep in the armchair by the Cicero. A shaft of light across his face, so peaceful. I traced the line of his jaw with my eyes, memorizing it. I think he was pretending. I think he felt my gaze like a touch. ” The words were simple, direct, and utterly devastating. They spoke of a secret, of a love that was both acknowledged and unspoken, lived in the hushed spaces of this very room. A romance breathed between the lines of old texts. She felt like a trespasser, but she couldn’t stop. She flipped towards the end. The entries grew shorter, more fraught. “ Settembre 10. It cannot be. It is a beautiful dream that will ruin everything. He leaves tomorrow. Back to his world. We said nothing of today. We said everything last night, without words. The last letter will have to say the rest. I will leave it where he will find it, one day. If he ever comes back. ” The final entry was a single line, the ink blotted as if by a hasty, trembling hand. “ Settembre 11. He is gone. And I am a ghost in a sunlit room. ” Elara closed the notebook, her heart pounding a strange, syncopated rhythm. The atmospheric wistfulness of the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets. suddenly had a source, a specific, aching pulse. This was not just a house of old books; it was a house of an old, The late afternoon sun streamed through the tall windows, painting the ruined room in tones of gold and amber. She moved to the central table, her back to the great doors, forcing her focus onto a water-stained volume of Virgil. She was here to mend paper, not hearts. The practical, the tangible. That was her shield.

Then the light changed.

A long, cool shadow fell across the parchment, stretching from the doorway to touch her boots. The air thickened, grew still. A presence, silent and solid, filled the space behind her. Giacomo never entered so quietly. Her breath hitched, the diary’s warning echoing in her mind. He is not what he seems.

Before she could turn, a voice spoke. Not Giacomo’s. This voice was deeper, textured with a familiarity that tore through a decade of careful walls, landing like a blow directly in the center of her chest. It was a voice from a life she had sealed away as thoroughly as any damaged folio.

“Hello, Elara.”

Time fractured. The voice belonged to Leo. The man who had vanished eight years ago, leaving only a ghost and a gutted heart. The man whose name she had last seen, she now realized with dizzying horror, inscribed in a different, older hand on the flyleaf of a forbidden book upstairs. The connection was a lightning strike. He wasn’t just from her past. He was part of this place, this mystery. And he had found her.

She turned, slowly, the assessment form fluttering from her numb fingers. He stood in the doorway, the setting sun haloing his form, his face in shadow. But she knew the set of his shoulders, the quiet intensity. He took a single step into the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., his eyes holding hers, and she saw it there: not just shock, but a grim, shared understanding.

“I wondered if they’d send you,” he said, his gaze dropping to the protective sleeve containing the diary on the table beside her. “Now that you’re here, we need to talk. Before they realize you’ve found it.”
