 ng away. The moment shattered. The spell was broken. Elara exhaled, her lungs burning as if she’d been holding her breath for years.

She picked up the bone folder, her fingers still tingling. The tool felt heavy in her palm, its smooth surface cool against her skin. She could still feel the ghost of his touch, the warmth of his fingers lingering like a brand. The memory of that moment in Oxford flooded back, unbidden. The way his eyes had crinkled at the corners when he smiled, the way his hand had brushed against hers as they pored over the ancient text. It had been so long ago, yet it felt like yesterday.

The Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. seemed to close in around her, the air thick with the weight of unspoken words and unresolved emotions. She could hear the faint rustle of pages as Leo turned them, the scratch of his pen against paper. Each sound was a reminder of the distance between them, a chasm that had grown wider with each passing year.

Elara forced herself to focus on the task at hand, her fingers moving with practiced precision. She carefully lifted a fragile page, her breath steadying as she worked. The letter from Carlo Conti lay before her, its secrets still unspoken. She could feel the weight of its history, the echoes of a love that had once burned brightly before being extinguished. It was a reminder of the fragility of human connections, of the way love could be both beautiful and destructive.

As she worked, she couldn’t help but steal glances at Leo. His dark hair was slightly tousled, as if he had run his fingers through it in frustration. His brow was furrowed in concentration, his lips pressed into a thin line. He was a man of contradictions, a mix of strength and vulnerability, of passion and restraint. She remembered the way he had looked at her all those years ago, the way his eyes had held a promise of something more. But that promise had been broken, shattered by the weight of their own fears and insecurities.

The silence between them was heavy, a tangible presence that filled the room. It was a silence that spoke of unspoken words, of regrets and longing. Elara could feel it pressing against her, a weight that threatened to crush her beneath its burden. She wanted to reach out, to bridge the gap between them, but she knew that the past was a fragile thing, easily shattered by the weight of the present.

She turned her attention back to the letter, her fingers tracing the delicate script. It was a relic of a time long past, proof of the enduring power of love and loss.
