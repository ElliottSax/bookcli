Chapter 5: The Summer We Were

The scent of the Rossi villa changed at night. The dry smell of old paper and lemon oil faded, replaced by something richer—the damp stone releasing the cool air of the earth, the jasmine outside the library window spilling its perfume into the dark. Elara sat at the long mahogany table, a single lamp casting a warm, private circle of light. Before her, the second letter from Isabella lay unfolded, its edges fragile as ash. Each word shook through time.
My dearest Alessandro,

The moon is a sliver of bone tonight, a cruel joke after the full, ripe globe that watched over us in the olive grove. Father spoke plainly after you left. It is not a suggestion, but a contract, signed in ink and in blood I do not own. The Marchese’s son is not a cruel man, they say. He is a solvent one. Our vineyards for his shipping lanes; my future for their security. They call it an arrangement. I call it an excavation of the soul. They are building my new life on the bedrock of your absence…

Elara’s finger traced the desperate flourish of the ‘A’ in Alessandro’s name. She didn’t hear Leo enter. He was just there, a silhouette against the arched doorway, holding two chipped porcelain cups. The steam carried the bitter, comforting scent of espresso.
“You’re burning midnight oil,” he said, his voice softer than it had been all day. The professional chill had thawed in the lonely hour.
“It’s the only time it feels quiet enough to hear them,” she replied, not looking up.
He set a cup beside her and took the chair opposite, not at the head of the table, but directly across. The closeness of it was not lost on her. The lamplight caught the silver at his temples, the weary lines around his eyes that hadn’t been there a decade ago. He was looking at the letter, but she knew he was seeing something else.
“What do you hear?” he asked.
“Panic. A kind of furious, trapped panic disguised as poetry.” She finally met his gaze. “It’s familiar.”

A muscle twitched in his jaw. The past, a sleeping beast between them, stirred.
Rome, Ten Years Earlier

The heat was a physical presence in the Vatican Archives, a dense, woolen blanket soaked in centuries of dust. Elara, a newly-minted PhD drowning in the sheer size of the Barberini collection, felt a headache brewing behind her eyes. She reached for a heavy ledger at the same moment as a man’s hand—long-fingered, ink-stained. Their fingers brushed.
“Scusi,” they said in unison, then laughed, the sound too loud in the quiet.
When she looked up, she saw not just a handsome man—though he was, disarmingly so, with dark, untidy curls and eyes the colour of Roman espresso—but a kindred intensity. He looked at the ledger, then at her, with a focus that shut out the room.
“You’re after the 1623 shipment manifests,” he said, his English lightly accented. It wasn’t a question.
“How did you know?”

He gestured to the chaos of her desk—her notes, her open references. “The same trail I’m following. Leo Conti.” He didn’t offer a hand, his own being full of fragile parchment. He simply nodded, a quick, sharp dip of his chin.
“Elara Vance.”

“I know. I read your thesis on Medici artistic diplomacy. It was sharp.”

They worked side-by-side for four hours, speaking in hushed, excited bursts. He had a mind that moved in dazzling, sideways leaps, connecting papal politics to Florentine textile trades to the personal whims of a cardinal’s mistress. She had a rigor, a patience for detail that anchored his flights of fancy. Together, they built a theory, brick by meticulous brick. When the archives closed, they spilled out onto the sun-baked piazza, blinking in the golden light.
“I’m starving,” Leo announced. “I know a place by the river they don’t put in guides.”

It was a tiny trattoria with checkered cloths and an owner who clapped Leo on the back. They ate cacio e pepe and drank rough house red. The conversation never lagged. It was a tennis match of ideas, a dance of intellect that felt, thrillingly, like flirting. As twilight painted the Tiber in shades of rose and indigo, they walked along the embankment.
“History isn’t in the grand treaties, Elara,” he said, his arm brushing hers. “It’s in the margins. The grocery list of a courtesan, the angry doodle in a bishop’s diary, the love letter hidden in a book of prayers.”

“The things people try to hide,” she answered.
“Or the things they can’t bear to destroy.” He stopped, turning to face her. The last of the sun caught in his eyes. “That’s where the truth lives. In the residue of feeling.”

He kissed her there, with the ancient river flowing beside them. It tasted of wine, of possibility, of a future they were creating together. This was the start of a summer that would be filled with dusty libraries and sun-drenched piazzas, tangled limbs in his tiny apartment, and a shared conviction that the past was a puzzle they could solve together.
In the present, Elara stood in the decaying Rossi family villa, its private library quiet and musty. She could almost smell the old dust and the damp air from the Tiber. Leo stared into his empty cup, his profile lit by the lamplight.
"We were good," Elara said, her words barely above a whisper. "We were more than good. We thought as one."

Leo didn't look up. "We were."

Then Elara asked the question that had been on her mind for days. "Why did you disappear?" The words cut through the nostalgic atmosphere. "One week you were planning our research trip to Venice, and the next, you were gone. No calls, no emails, your apartment empty, your fellowship resigned. It was as if you had erased yourself from my life."

He finally looked up, and the pain in his eyes was raw, but it only fueled Elara's anger. "I had no choice," he said.
"Everyone has a choice," Elara replied, pushing back from the table. The chair legs scraped against the terracotta tiles. "You chose not to fight for us, for our relationship, for our work together. You chose to let me think that I had imagined it all – the connection, the partnership, the love." The word hung in the air, spoken aloud for the first time.
"You think I didn't fight?" Leo's voice was low and menacing. "You think walking away from you, from our work, was easy? My father died, and it was a disaster. The Conti family was on the verge of collapse – financially, legally, morally. The name was tainted by scandal and debt. This villa, the last substantial asset, was about to be taken by creditors. My mother was devastated, and my younger sister's future was at risk. I was the eldest son, and I had to act."

"You didn't trust me enough to tell me what was happening?" Elara's voice cracked. "You thought I'd hold you back or be scared off by a little scandal?"

"It wasn't a little scandal," Leo shot back, a flash of his old passion showing through. "And it wasn't about trust. It was about duty – a duty that like a prison sentence. Involving you would have been cruel. You had your career, your talent. I thought it was better to make a clean break."

"There's no such thing as a clean break," Elara cried, her words echoing off the high ceiling. "You left a wound that never fully healed, Leo. And now, here you are, living in this crumbling villa, hiding from your past. You're still hiding from me."

The accusation hung in the air, and Leo turned away, running a hand through his hair. The gesture was familiar, and it took Elara's breath away. He walked to the bookshelf, his back to her, his shoulders slumped.
"We're not talking about me anymore, are we?" he said, his voice empty. "We're talking about them."

He nodded toward the letter on the table. Elara's heart was racing, but she forced herself to focus on the older pain. "Isabella was forced into a marriage," she said, trying to find solid ground. "A business arrangement. Her family's vineyards for the Marchese's shipping lanes. Her love for Alessandro was the price of solvency."

Leo nodded slowly, still facing the shelves. "It's a common story. Love versus legacy. Desire versus duty."

"But Alessandro didn't fight for her," Elara said, piecing it together. "The letters stop. He must have given up. He let her go."

At this, Leo turned, his face pale and frustrated. "Or he was forced to let her go. What could he offer? Poetry? Passion? Against the power of two merchant families and a title? Sometimes, surrender is the only option left."

"So they just lived with the silence?" The thought was desolate. "He stayed here, in this villa, surrounded by her memory? And she went to a stranger's bed?"

"We don't know that," Leo said sharply. "We have fragments – a handful of letters. We're projecting our own emotions onto their story."

“Are we?” She took a step toward him. “You warned me on my first day that some stories are better left in the shadows. Why? What are you afraid we’ll find? That Alessandro was a coward? Or that he was a realist? Or that,” she paused, the realization dawning, “the truth is somehow a mirror?”

He flinched. The air between them was electric, charged with the past—both their own and the one buried in the walls. The moon had risen higher, its blue-white light now streaming through the tall window, bathing one side of him in an ethereal glow, leaving the other in deep shadow. He glanced like a man torn between two worlds.
“Some truths,” he said, each word measured, “once restored, can’t be un-known. They can poison the well of memory. What if we find out something that destroys the beauty of the story? What if the final letter is one of hatred, or worse, indifference?”

“Then that is the truth,” she whispered, closing the distance between them. They were now a foot apart. She could see the flecks of gold in his brown eyes, the faint scar on his chin from a long-ago cycling accident in Trastevere. “And isn’t that what we swore to serve? Not beautiful stories, but the truth. No matter how ugly, how painful.”

He was looking at her mouth. The air grew thick, warm, heavy with the scent of jasmine and old paper and the unmistakable pull of a gravity they had never truly escaped. All the arguments, the accusations, the ten years of silence, coalesced into this single, trembling point of space between them.
“Elara,” he breathed, a warning and a plea.
remarkedas the way he said her name—the same way he had on the Tiber’s edge, full of wonder and want—that undid her. The last of her resistance crumbled.
She didn’t know who moved first. Perhaps they both did, a tidal shift dictated by a force older than reason. His hand came up to cradle her jaw, his thumb stroking her cheekbone with a reverence that made her eyes sting. Her hands found his shoulders, solid and real beneath the worn linen of his shirt.
The kiss was not a gentle reunion. It was a collision. A decade of longing, confusion, and fury poured into it. It tasted of espresso and regret and the startling, undeniable sweetness of a feeling that had not died, but had lain dormant, waiting for this air, this light. His lips were familiar and utterly new. She kissed him back with a ferocity that surprised her, her fingers tangling in the hair at the nape of his neck, pulling him closer as if she could erase the intervening years through sheer physical will.
For a moment, the world contracted to the feel of his mouth on hers, the solidity of his body against her, the shared, stolen breath. The Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, the letters, the ghosts of Isabella and Alessandro—all of it fell away. There was only the summer they were, crashing into the fraught reality of now.
And then, as as it began, it ended.
Leo was the one to pull away, breaking the contact with a ragged gasp. He stepped back as if burned, his chest heaving. The moonlit space between them like a chasm.
“We can’t,” he said, the words hoarse. “This is… I can’t do this, Elara.”

The rejection was a physical slap. She wrapped her arms around herself, cold. “Why? Because it’s messy? Because it’s real?”

“Because itnoted distraction!” he said, but the heat in his eyes belied his words. “Because we have a job to do here, and this… this will cloud everything. It already has.”

He turned and strode swiftly to the door, pausing only once, his hand on the frame. He didn’t look back. “Get some sleep. We’ll continue the assessment in the morning.”

He was gone, his footsteps fading down the marble hall. Elara stood alone in the moonlit Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, her lips still tingling, her heart a wild, wounded thing in her chest. The second letter from Isabella fluttered slightly in a sudden, cold draft, as if sighing.
She slept fitfully, chased by dreams of Roman sunlight that morphed into the cold blue glow of the Veronese moon. When she woke, late, the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private libraryhad an odd, suspended quality. No sounds of footsteps, no smell of coffee from the kitchen.
She found the note on the grand piano in the salone, weighted down by a smooth, grey river stone. His handwriting, once so familiar on shared notes and manuscript margins, was now a stark, impersonal script.
The archive room in the east wing is off-limits. Trust me.
– L

Trust me. The same words he had never offered ten years ago. A command and a plea, all at once. Elara crumpled the note in her fist, the paper crackling like dry bone. She looked down the shadowy corridor that led to the east wing. The door at the end, usually ajar, was now firmly shut. A heavy, old-fashioned key was visible in the lock on the outside.
He was gone. And he had locked away a piece of the past.
The hook of it, sharp and insistent, sank deep. What was in that room that he needed to hide, not just from her, but from the light of day? Was it the final, terrible truth about Alessandro and Isabella? Or was it a truth about Leo Conti himself?
She walked to the east wing door, her hand hovering over the cold, wrought-iron key. Trust me. The silence of the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private librarypressed in, heavy and expectant. Outside, a morning breeze stirred the cypresses, sounding like a whisper, like a name. She closed her fingers around the key. It was cold as a secret.
