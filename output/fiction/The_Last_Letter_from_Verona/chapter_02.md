Chapter 2: Ghost in the Villa

Decay held a different scent by daylight—less mysterious, more mournful. Elara stood in the grand, corpse-like room she had only glimpsed in shadows the night before. Sunlight, thick with dancing motes of dust, fell in heavy bars through gaps in the shuttered windows, illuminating a battlefield of neglect. Towers of books slumped against each other like drunken soldiers. Leather spines were furred with pale mould. Once surely a rich, gleaming brown, the great mahogany shelves had turned grey and parched, their scrollwork choked with cobwebs that glittered ominously in the slanted light. Old paper, damp stone, and the faint, sweet-sour tang of rotting wood hung in the air.
Her tools lay on a sheet of clean canvas: brushes, scalpels, Japanese paper, pots of wheat starch paste—a bastion of order against the chaos. That morning had been spent assessing, her professional mind compartmentalising the tragedy into manageable tasks. Priority One: the ledger shelf, showing active foxing. Priority Two: the stack near the leaking exterior wall. But beneath the calm checklist, a current of unease thrummed, persistent as a distant bell. This silence was not empty; it was watchful.
A careful lift of a water-stained volume of Petrarchan sonnets—then a footfall on the marble of the hall, too firm for Signora Rossi’s shuffling step. The decisive tap of a man’s shoe followed on the library’s oak threshold.
Elara turned, the book still cradled in her gloved hands.
He stood a silhouette against the brighter light of the hallway, tall and lean. Then he stepped into a pillar of sunlight, and the world did not so much tilt as shatter, the fragments falling in slow, cutting silence.
Leo.
A decade fell away in a heartbeat, not as a gentle memory but as a physical blow. Those sharp, intelligent bones of his face remained, though harder now, the angles more severe. That same dark, unruly hair, though threaded with silver at the temples, brushed his collar. A simple, faded linen shirt and trousers spoke of solitude, not style. But his eyes—deep-set, espresso-dark—were unchanged. They held the same unsettling intensity, the same capacity for absolute focus, now fixed entirely on her.
Shock flooded through her, cold then scalding. Her breath hitched, trapped. The careful, professional distance built for this job crystallised—then audibly cracked. A small, sharp sound escaped her throat.
He did not speak. He simply stood, absorbing her presence as she absorbed his. The air between them thickened, charged with the ghost of every unspoken word, every touch, every promise from ten years ago. His jaw tightened, a tiny muscle flickering. Hands, loose at his sides, curled slowly into fists before relaxing with visible effort. He looked like a man seeing a ghost. Or perhaps he was the ghost, summoned by this foolish return to a city of old stones and older regrets.
“Elara.” Her name from his lips was not a greeting, but an acknowledgement, stripped bare—a stone dropped into a deep well.
“Leo.” Her voice, thank God, remained steady, cold. It was the one reserved for difficult clients. “This is a revelation.”

A faint, bitter twist touched his mouth. Not a smile. “I suppose it is.”

“You suppose.” Carefully, she set the Petrarch down on the canvas. The action granted a moment to steady herself, to lock away the screaming part within. “The contract. The anonymity. This was your doing.”

“It was.” A few steps carried him into the room, his gaze leaving her face to sweep over the ruined library. The professional in her noted the way his eyes tracked the damage, the slight wince at a particularly ravished folio. It was the only hint of the man she’d known—the one whose passion for history was a living, breathing thing. “Your reputation precedes you. Elara Vance, the saviour of impossible texts. The British Library’s secret weapon. There is no one better.”

“Flattery from a ghost is particularly hollow.” The words emerged sharp and wounded. She hadn’t meant to sound so personal so quickly. Ice had been the intention.
His eyes snapped back to hers, and for a fleeting second, the guard dropped. A flash of the old Leo appeared—the one who’d whispered against her skin in a cheap pensione, who’d argued about Renaissance politics with wine-flushed cheeks, who’d looked at her as if she were the only manuscript worth deciphering in the world. Then the shutters came down, leaving his expression cool, remote.
“This is not flattery. It is fact. The collection here is unique. A family archive spanning five centuries. Letters, ledgers, journals, literary drafts. It is crumbling into nothing. It needs you.”

“And you couldn’t ask me yourself? You had to lure me here under false pretences?” Her arms crossed, a defensive gesture she immediately hated.
“Would you have come,” he asked, his voice low, “if you had known it was me?”

The question hung in the dusty air. The honest answer was a deafening *no*. She ignored it. “That isn’t the point. The deception is.”

“The deception was necessary.” He moved to a shelf, running a finger along its dusty edge without looking at her. “Our past… is irrelevant.”to this work. It is a closed book, Elara. This,” he gestured around them, “is what matters now. I am prepared to offer you double your usual fee. Full autonomy. Signora Rossi sees to your needs. You restore the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets.. We interact only as required, on professional terms.”

The clinical efficiency of it was a new kind of shock. It stripped the encounter of any lingering romance, any hope of explanation. This was a business proposition from a stranger who happened to wear the face of the man who had broken her heart. He vanished, she reminded herself. One letter, then silence. He chose this.
Fury, clean and hot, melt the ice in her veins. “You don’t get to dictate terms about our past. You don’t get to declare it ‘irrelevant’ after what you did.”

Now he glanced at her, and his gaze was like flint. “What I did,” he said, each word precise, “was what was necessary. The reasons belong to that closed book. We can work together professionally, or you can leave. The choice is yours. The advance has been transferred. You can keep it, regardless.”

Leave. The word echoed. She could walk out of this tomb of a Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, away from this ghost, back to her ordered, solitary life in London. She could preserve the scar tissue over the old wound he had just ruthlessly reopened.
Her eyes travelled over the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library. They fell on a small, vellum-bound ledger, its pages swollen with damp, its ink threatening to bloom into illegibility. Next to it was a bundle of letters, their seals cracked. She thought of the whispers of history trapped here, the voices waiting to be heard before they faded forever. This was why she had come. Not for him. For this.
“The work is why I’m here,” she said finally, her voice taut. “Not for you. For them.” She nodded at the books. “I’ll stay. On my terms. I set the schedule. You stay out of my way. And we do not speak of anything other than the conservation of this collection. Is that clear?”

A flicker of something—relief? regret?—passed behind his eyes. He gave a single, curt nod. “Clear.” He turned to go, then paused. “The east wing is unstable. Signora Rossi will show you the safe areas. Dinner is at eight. It is… expected that you join me. To discuss the collection’s priorities.”

It was not an invitation. It was a command from her employer. She nodded, equally curt.
He left then, his footsteps receding down the hall. The Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private libraryappeared to exhale, the dust settling back into its slow dance. Elara sank onto the stool by her worktable, her legs unsteady. The confrontation had lasted minutes, but she hollowed out, as if she’d run for miles. The ghost was flesh and blood, and he was colder than any spectre.
The dinner was an exquisite, silent torture.
It was held in a tiny, vaulted chamber off the kitchen, not the cavernous formal dining room. A simple wooden table was set with two places, a carafe of local Valpolicella, and a dish of olives. Signora Rossi served a fragrant risotto al tastasal and then disappeared, leaving them in a pool of candlelight thato emphasise the chasm between them.
They spoke in staccato bursts about paper acidity, about pest eradication methods, about the relative merits of different deacidification sprays. It was a bizarre pantomime of professionalism. Elara found herself watching his hands as he poured the wine—the same long, elegant fingers that had once traced the line of her jaw, now bearing a new, thin scar across the knuckle. She listened to his voice, deeper now, with a new, gravelly undertone, and tried to match it to the voice in her memory that had spoken fluent, passionate Italian in her ear.
“The ledgers from the 18th century are the most urgent,” he replied, not looking up from his plate. “They detail the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library’s trade with the Orient. The ink is iron gall, and it is eating through the paper.”

“I assessed them today. The damage is severe but stabilisable.” She took a sip of wine. “I found evidence of earlier attempts at repair. In the 1920s, perhaps. They used a glue that has now turned acidic.”

He nodded, a glimmer of professional respect in his eyes. “My grandfather. He was… enthusiastic but ill-informed.”

A personal detail. Small, but it like a breach in his own wall. She didn’t push it.
The silence stretched, filled only with the scrape of cutlery on china and the mournful cry of an owl in the cypress trees outside. Everything they weren’t saying pressed down on them: the shared years at university, the research trip to Venice where they’d gotten lost in the backstreets and found a forgotten chapel, the plans they’d made—plans for a life, for a partnership, both professional and personal. The last letter she’d received from him, posted from Verona, full of excitement about a family discovery he needed to attend to, a discovery that would “change everything.” And then, nothing. A void. Her frantic letters returned unanswered, her calls unconnected. A grief so deep she had buried it under layers of career and careful, emotionless precision.
“Why this collection, Leo?” The question escaped her, softer than she intended, drawn out by the candlelight and the history held in the stones around them. “You walked away from academia. From… everything. To become a hermit guarding a pile of rotting paper?”

He put his fork down carefully. The candle flame reflected in his dark eyes, making them unreadable. “This is not a pile of rotting paper. It is a legacy. My family’s. And in its way, a city’s. Some things are worth preserving, even in isolation.” He looked directly at her then, and the charge returned. “Even if the cost is high.”

“What cost?” she whispered, the professional facade crumbling.
He stood up abruptly, his chair scraping loudly on the stone floor. “The priorities are in the folder on the desk. I will not disturb you again unless necessary. Goodnight, Elara.”

He was gone before she could respond, melting into the dark shadows of the corridor.
Sleep was impossible. The villa creaked and sighed around her, a living thing breathing the stories of centuries. The moon was high, casting a blue-silver light through her window. Driven by a restlessness she couldn’t name, Elara pulled on a sweater and, taking a powerful torch, made her way back to the library.
In the stark beam of the torch, the room was even more hauntingly beautiful. It like her domain now, a kingdom of silent, waiting words. She went to the shelf of 19th-century ledgers, the ones he’d mentioned were less critical. Perhaps she needed the mindless, tactile work of an initial assessment.
She pulled out a heavy, cloth-bound ledger from 1842. *Conti Family Holdings: Vineyard Yields and Expenses*. As she opened it, a puff of musty air escaped. She gently fan the pages, checking for mould, for binding integrity. It was methodical, calming.
As she reached the middle, the spine gaped slightly, a common fault. She aimed her torch into the crevice, checking for broken threads. There, tucked deep into the gutter, not a part of the book at all, was a folded piece of paper.
Frowning, she used a pair of tweezers to carefully extract it. It was a single sheet, heavier than the ledger paper, stained and brittle at the edges. As she unfolded it on her worktable under the bright light, her heart stuttered.
One side was badly damaged, blackened and curled, as if it had been snatched from a fire. The other was mostly intact. It was a letter, written in a flowing, elegant Italian hand in dark brown ink. The date at the top was partially burned away, but she could make out *Verona, 18....*

And then she read the opening line. The blood drained from her face, a deafening silence ringing in her ears.
It began: *“Mio unico, mio cuore perduto…”*

My only one, my lost heart…

The very words Leo had written to her, in his own, modern hand, in the last letter she had ever received from him ten years ago. The line that had been burned into her memory, the prelude to his disappearance.
Her hands trembled as she read the next, older lines, the paper whispering under her trembling breath.
*“Mio unico, mio cuore perduto,”*

The sun has not risen since you left the city. The stones of the Piazza delle Erbe hold no warmth, the wine tastes of ash. They tell me it is madness, this waiting, this hoping for a word that cannot, by the laws of man and heaven, ever come. They do not understand that my soul is not my own to govern; it fled with you, and resides now in the shadow of your smile, in the echo of your laugh. This house is a tomb. I am a ghost within it, haunting the places we once were. Every ledger I open, every contract I sign, is a lie. The only truth is written here, in this secret, hopeless alphabet of longing. I fear this will never reach you. I fear you will never know that I broke every vow, save the one I made to my own heart. Burn this, my love. But know, as it turns to smoke, that my love is its twin—impossible to contain, impossible to extinguish, destined only to rise and vanish into the indifferent air.”

There was no signature. Only a devastating, final smear of ink, and the cruel, scorched edge of the paper.
Elara sat in the profound silence, the torchlight pooling around the fragile, burned page. The familiar endearment, a haunting echo across centuries, now like a key turning in a lock deep within the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library’s heart. This was no coincidence. This was a thread, thin and charred, connecting her past to this place’s hidden history. Leo’s secret was here, buried in the archives. And it was speaking, directly and impossibly, to her.
