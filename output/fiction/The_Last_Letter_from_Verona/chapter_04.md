Chapter 4: Whispers in Vellum

The silence of the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets. was no longer empty. It was filled, now, with the ghosts of two summers: one from a century and a half ago, pressed into ink, and their own, a raw, unfinished thing that hovered in the space between every word they didn’t speak. Elara worked with a new, feverish intensity in the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., the single discovered letter a siren’s call. She knew there had to be more. Paper, like love, rarely existed in isolation.

She found them three days later, not in the grand shelves, but in the desk. It was an accident, a moment of frustration. A drawer in the vast, carved oak desk—the one Leo used as a sort of command centre—had stuck. He was elsewhere, perhaps in the overgrown orangery she’d seen him retreat to each afternoon. She jiggled the brass handle, then pulled harder. With a protesting groan, the drawer came free, and behind it, tucked into the cavity of the desk’s body, a small, velvet-wrapped bundle slid partially into view.

Her breath caught. This was not her domain; this was intrusion. But the shape was unmistakable. She glanced at the doorway, a listener in the quiet. Then, with fingers that trembled only slightly, she reached in and drew out the parcel. The velvet was moth-eaten, the colour of dried blood. Unfolding it, she revealed a stack of perhaps ten letters, tied with a faded ribbon. The paper was different from the first—thicker, more personal. The handwriting was the same elegant, forward-slanting script: Alessandro’s. But these were addressed. Alla mia anima, Isabella. To my soul.

The first few were effusive, poetic outpourings from a man intoxicated. Descriptions of Isabella’s eyes (‘twin pools of twilight where I gladly drown’), of stolen kisses in the lemon grove, of a night spent listening to the nightingales by the river Adige. Elara read them at her conservation table, the afternoon sun painting a slow, golden rectangle across the vellum. She felt like a thief, but one compelled by a higher law. The words were alive. They smelled of pressed flowers and desperation.

And then, Isabella’s replies began to appear. Her hand was sharper, more disciplined, but no less passionate. She wrote of the constraints of her world, of watchful eyes, of a family that viewed the poet’s affections as a dangerous diversion. The romance, Elara pieced together, had bloomed in the summer of 1872. Alessandro was a guest of the Conti family, a rising literary star. Isabella was… not a Conti. A neighbour, perhaps? A visitor from a more rigid, aristocratic milieu.

The parallels were not subtle. They were a punch to the gut. The secret meetings. The language of souls recognizing each other. The looming, unspoken threat of the outside world. Elara saw herself and Leo in every line—the reckless, all-consuming hope of their early twenties, when he was the brilliant doctoral student and she the quiet art history undergrad who understood the weight of old things. They had planned a life, a partnership of minds. Then, one autumn, without explanation, he had vanished from his Cambridge college, leaving only a brief, devastating note that spoke of family obligations and an impossibility that crushed her world to dust.

She was holding a page from Isabella, her words blurred by what looked like water damage—or tears—when Leo’s shadow fell across the table.

She jumped, her heart hammering against her ribs. She hadn’t heard him approach. He stood, looking at the spread of letters, his expression unreadable. For a long moment, he said nothing. The air tightened.

“You found the rest,” he said finally, his voice flat.

“They were in the desk. The drawer stuck. It was an accident.” The justification sounded feeble.

He nodded slowly, not accusing, just absorbing. “I’d forgotten they were there. My grandfather showed them to me once, a lifetime ago. Called them ‘the scandal in paper.’” He reached out, not for the letters, but for the empty velvet wrap, running his thumb over the worn pile. “He said some histories are better left bound and buried.”

“Why?” The word was out before she could stop it, charged with a decade of her own unanswered questions.

He looked at her then, really looked at her, and the professional mask he’d worn since her arrival fissured. She saw exhaustion, and a profound loneliness that mirrored the empty halls of the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets.. “Because they’re messy,” he said, his voice low. “They don’t fit the narrative. The Conti narrative is one of lineage, stability, respectability. Not of poets and doomed affairs that threaten alliances.”

“Is that what happened? An alliance?”

“I don’t know all of it,” he admitted. He pulled out the chair opposite her and sat, the movement weary. “Isabella was from the Della Rovere family. Old money, older blood. A marriage was arranged for her with a Milanese industrialist. Alessandro… was inspiration, but not investment.”

The clinical terms hung in the air. Investment. Alliance. Elara thought of her own middle-class upbringing, her parents’ quiet, contented life in Dorset. She had never been an investment to Leo, she was sure of that. But she had, perhaps, been an impossibility in a different calculus.

“And your family? What did they do?”

“What families like mine do,” he said, a bitter edge creeping in. “They buried it. They sent Alessandro packing, probably with a generous ‘patronage’ gift to secure his silence. They forbade Isabella from returning. The letters here are the ones he sent that were intercepted, or that she left behind. My great-great-grandfather collected them like evidence of a crime. Then sealed them away, hoping time would erase the story.”

“But you became a historian,” she said softly. “You dig up what’s buried.”

A faint, grim smile touched his lips. “A reaction, I suppose. I grew up in this house, Elara. Every portrait whispered perfection. Every heirloom had a sanctioned story. But I could always smell the rot under the floorboards. The unspoken things. I went into history not to celebrate the past, but to autopsy it. To find the truth in the stains and the silences.” He paused, his gaze drifting to the window, where the cypresses stood like sentinels. “It made me rather unpopular here.”

The confession was a crack in the wall. Elara felt a dangerous urge to reach across the table, to bridge the space. She didn’t.

“Is that why you came back? For the autopsy?”

He was silent for so long she thought he wouldn’t answer. “I came back because it was dying,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “The house, the legacy, the lies. My father was gone. My mother in a clinic in Switzerland. There was no one else to watch it fall. So I came to witness. And to… understand what I’d run from.”

What you’d run from. The words echoed. He had run from Cambridge, from his work, from her. Did he include her in the constellation of things he needed to understand?

As if reading her thought, he straightened. “It’s getting late. And you’ve been breathing in mould and dust all day.” He gestured to the letters. “We should… we could discuss this properly. Over dinner. In the kitchen. It’s the only room with a reliably warm stove.”

It wasn’t an apology, nor was it a social overture. It was a practical suggestion from one scholar to another. But it was also the first time he had offered a shared space that wasn’t the charged battlefield of the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. or the frozen formalities of the foyer.

“Alright,” she said, surprising herself.
The kitchen was a vast, cavernous room at the back of the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets., dominated by a great hearth and a heavy, scarred table of pale maple. Unlike the rest of the house, it held a residual warmth, both physical and human. Copper pots hung from hooks, and the scent of garlic, rosemary, and woodsmoke lived in the stones. Leo moved with a quiet efficiency here, different from his stiff Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. demeanour. He lit lamps, their soft glow pushing back the encroaching twilight, and produced a simple meal: a plate of cured meats and olives, a wedge of sharp, aged cheese, bread he warmed in the oven, and a bottle of local Valpolicella.

They ate at one end of the long table, the letters between them like a silent third guest. The conversation began haltingly, orbiting the safe moon of historical context.

“The water damage on this one,” Elara said, carefully lifting Isabella’s tear-stained page with tweezers. “It obscures a key line. I can try a gentle ethanol vapour later, but it’s risky.”

“What can you see?” he asked, pouring wine into two simple tumblers.

“Fragments. ‘They will never…’ and ‘…my family has made…’ The rest is a blur.”

“A familiar refrain,” Leo murmured, taking a sip of wine. He looked older in the lamplight, the shadows carving deeper lines around his eyes, but also more real. The boy she knew was still there, buried under the weight of the man he’d had to become. “Choice. The illusion of it, at least. In families like Isabella’s, and mine, choice is often just the ratification of a decision made generations before you were born.”

“Is that what happened to you?” The question slipped out, quiet but clear in the intimate space.

He didn’t flinch. He studied the dark liquid in his glass. “In a way. My father’s illness—it wasn’t just physical. It was financial. The Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets., the lands, they were a beautiful corpse, haemorrhaging money. The only asset left was the family’s reputation, a currency still spendable in certain circles. My sudden return, my… severance from my academic life abroad… was part of a salvage operation. A marriage was proposed. An advantageous one.”

Elara’s blood ran cold. She put a piece of bread down, her appetite gone. “You were engaged?”

“No,” he said quickly, meeting her eyes. “No. I agreed to come back. I agreed to try and steady the ship. But I could not agree to that. It was the one line I wouldn’t cross.” He let out a long, slow breath. “The consequence was exile within these very walls. The money dried up. The proposed bride’s family was insulted. I became the recluse, the failed heir, tending to his crumbling inheritance and his ailing mother’s needs. This,” he gestured around the kitchen, “is the extent of my kingdom now. And the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets..”

She understood then. His vanishing act hadn’t been a rejection of her, not purely. It had been a collapse—of a family, of a future, of a self. He had chosen this prison over a different, gilded one. The anger she had nursed for a decade shifted, its geometry altered painfully.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” The words were a raw whisper. “You just left a note, Leo. You broke… everything.”

The pain on his face was immediate and unguarded. “Because I was ashamed,” he said, the admission ripped from him. “Ashamed of the gilded cage I came from. Ashamed of the disaster I was being summoned to. I was twenty-four, Elara. I thought I could outrun it, outthink it. And when I realized I couldn’t, I thought the noblest, most stupid thing I could do was set you free of the mess. I thought my note was a clean cut. I see now it was just a coward’s wound.”

Tears pricked hotly at the back of her eyes. She looked down at her hands, at the fine scars and stains of her trade. She had built a life, a celebrated career, on fixing broken things. But some breaks were too complex, the pieces too reshaped by time.

“It wasn’t yours to make,” she said finally, not looking at him. “That choice.”

“I know,” he said. “It is the greatest regret of my life. Not coming back, but how I left you.”

The air was thick with the unsaid, with the ghost of the future they’d planned. The silence stretched, but it was different now—not hostile, but heavy with a shared, mournful truth.

To break it, Elara turned back to the letters. “We should finish this,” she said, her voice thick. “Isabella. We owe it to her to hear the rest.”

He nodded, grateful for the pivot. They worked through the remaining letters. The tone darkened. Alessandro’s plans for elopement grew more frantic. Isabella’s replies became shorter, more despairing. The outside pressure was a vise. Then, they reached the last one in the cache. From Isabella. It was dated September 2, 1872.

My dearest Alessandro,

Your words are fire, but my world is ice. They have found your last letter. All is discovered. My father has locked me in my rooms. The man from Milan arrives tomorrow. There is to be an announcement.

Do not think of folly, my love. Do not come for me. The walls are too high, the guards too many. They will never let us be. My family has made its choice, and in doing so, has made mine for me. I am to be a transaction, a balance on a ledger. My heart is to be listed under ‘losses.’

Forget me. No—do not forget me. But live. Write your verses. Let one of them, in some small, secret way, be for the girl who loved you in the lemon grove, when the world was still summer.

Yours, in this life and any other,
Isabella

Elara finished reading aloud, her voice failing on the last line. The kitchen was utterly still. The tragedy of it, so complete, so final, wrapped around them. Isabella had been given no autopsy. Her truth had been buried alive.

“God,” Leo breathed, rubbing a hand over his face. “They crushed them.”

“She sounds so final,” Elara said, a tear escaping and tracing a path through the dust on her cheek. “Like she’s saying goodbye.”

“She was.”

Elara stared at the letter. The finality was the hook, the thing that caught in her historian’s mind. “But we only have his side of the correspondence after this. What if… what if she changed her mind? What if there was one more letter? A secret one? Something that didn’t get intercepted?”

Leo looked skeptical, but the ember of his own obsession was lit. “It’s possible. But where? If my ancestors found it, they would have destroyed it or added it to this pile.”

“Unless it never reached the house. Or unless someone else hid it.” Elara’s mind was racing, the professional puzzle a welcome relief from the emotional quagmire. “The letter we found first was separate, hidden in the book. What if there’s another? A reply to this?” She tapped Isabella’s farewell.

The challenge hung between them, a new, shared purpose. The weight of their own past receded slightly, pushed back by the urgency of this older, unresolved story.

“Where would you even begin?” Leo asked, but he was leaning forward now, the historian in him fully engaged.

“With the last place she felt free,” Elara said, the idea forming as she spoke. “You said it—the lemon grove. The nightingales by the river. Places they mention. Is the lemon grove still here?”

“It’s a wild thicket now. But yes, it’s down by the old wall.”

“We should look. Not just for letters. For anything. A locket, a token. Something she might have left, or he might have hidden.” She was aware of the ‘we’. It felt momentous.

Leo held her gaze for a long moment, the lamplight dancing in his dark eyes. The wistful atmosphere of the room deepened, charged with the thrill of the hunt and the echo of old heartbreaks. “First light,” he said. “The light is softest then. Best for seeing.”

It was a plan. A collaboration. The first since she’d arrived.

They cleared the meal in a companionable, quiet rhythm. As she was leaving, heading towards the cold grandeur of the main house and her lonely guest room, Leo spoke from the kitchen doorway.

“Elara.”
She turned.
“Thank you,” he said simply. “For not being afraid of the stains.”

She nodded, unable to speak, and walked into the dark hall.

Back in the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., unable to sleep, she returned to the water-damaged letter from Isabella. The one with the fragmented plea. The ethanol vapour treatment was delicate work, requiring patience and a steady hand. She set up her equipment, the small lamp a pool of light in the oceanic dark of the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets.. Slowly, carefully, she began the process, coaxing the moisture out, flattening the fibres, making the ink legible again.

It took an hour. The phrase emerged letter by letter, like a message from the deep.

‘They will never let us be. My family has made its choice.’

But then, beneath it, as the paper yielded its final secret, a new line appeared. A postscript, written in a hastier, more desperate hand, the ink a different shade, as if added later, in a moment of wild courage or despair.

‘But I have not. Meet me where the river kisses the old stone. Midnight. Bring only your heart. I will have a plan.’
