Chapter 10: The Last Letter

Chapter 10: The Last Letter

The storm that had been a bruise on the horizon all day finally broke over Verona just past midnight. It did not arrive with gentle rain, but with a violence that seemed personal. The first clap of thunder shook the very bones of Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets., its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets., a percussive shock that rattled the panes in the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets.’s French doors. Elara, who had been dozing fitfully on the chaise longue, jolted awake, her heart hammering against her ribs. The electricity flickered once, twice, and died, plunging the room into a darkness so complete it felt solid.

She fumbled for the hurricane lamp Leo had left on the desk. The match flared, casting a frantic, jumping light. In its glow, the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. was transformed. The familiar, comforting ranks of books became looming shadows; the painted cherubs on the ceiling were grotesque, leering faces. The wind screamed through the cypress trees, a sound like tearing silk and dying animals.

She was alone. Leo had gone back into the archive annex hours ago, determined to prepare the most fragile documents for tomorrow’s event—their last, desperate gamble. A live restoration and reading of Alessandro’s and Isabella’s letters for a select group of donors and journalists. “We’ll show them the heart of the place,” he’d said, his eyes fever-bright with a mix of hope and exhaustion. “We’ll make them feel what we feel. They have to.”

Now, in the howling dark, the plan felt like a child’s fantasy.

The storm’s intensity escalated. Rain lashed the windows not in drops, but in solid sheets. Another crack of thunder, closer this time, was followed by a sound that was utterly wrong—a deep, grinding groan, then a crash that was more felt than heard, a shudder that travelled up through the marble floors into the soles of her feet.

It came from the annex.

“Leo?”

Her voice was a whisper, swallowed by the storm. She seized the lamp, the hot metal of its handle biting into her palm, and ran. The corridor to the annex was a black tunnel. The air, usually cool and dry, was now thick with the smell of wet stone and something else—the sharp, clean scent of shattered timber.

The door to the annex was ajar. Her lamp light spilled into the space, and her breath caught.

A portion of the far wall, the ancient one that bordered the original Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets., had partially collapsed. A cascade of terracotta roof tiles and timber beams had fallen through, creating a jagged maw open to the lashing rain. A lake of water and debris was spreading across the floor, lapping at the legs of the steel restoration tables. But it was the bookshelves, two of them, that held her gaze. They were tilted at a terrifying angle, pinned by a massive, splintered beam. And between them was the reinforced cabinet where they had stored Alessandro’s journal and Isabella’s final letters for safekeeping.

And Leo was there.

He was on his knees, back to her, shoulders straining as he tried to lift the end of the beam. The water around him was already ankle-deep.

“Leo!”

He turned, his face a mask of grime and rain streaking through the opening. “Elara! Stay back! The ceiling’s unstable!”

“What are you doing? Get away from there!” She sloshed forward, the icy water shocking her.

“The cabinet,” he gasped, heaving at the wood. “The beam has it pinned. If the water rises any higher, or if another section goes…” He didn’t finish. He didn’t need to. The documents inside would be pulp in minutes.

“Forget the cabinet! Leo, please!” Panic, cold and slick, rose in her throat.

He looked at her then, and in the wild, dancing light, his eyes were not those of a rational man, but of a descendant. Of Alessandro. “I can’t,” he said, the words raw. “I won’t. Not after what we read. Not after knowing.”

Alessandro’s journal. They had read the final entries together just that evening, sitting side-by-side at the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. desk, their shoulders touching as if for courage.

The journal had charted the slow death of a soul. The entries after Isabella’s departure were sparse, the elegant script deteriorating into harsh, impatient scratches. Lists of Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets. management. Dry notes on vineyard yields. Then, months later, a single line: “The roses she planted have bloomed. I ordered them torn out. I could not bear their scent.”

The years condensed into a chronicle of quiet despair. A marriage of chilling politeness. The birth of a son, recorded with clinical detachment. The transformation of Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets., its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets. from a home into a beautiful, empty museum.

Then, the final entry. Not in the journal proper, but on a loose sheet, folded and tucked into the back, the paper thin and fragile as a dried leaf. Leo had unfolded it with trembling hands.

“To whoever finds this, if any soul ever does, I beg you: listen.

I chose the path of duty. I chose the preservation of stone and name over the preservation of my own heart. I told myself it was noble. I told myself the love I shared with Isabella was a fever dream, unsustainable, that the world we built in this Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets. was a fantasy. I was a coward. I used tradition as my shield and my family’s honour as my sword, and I cut away the only part of my life that ever truly mattered.

I have lived a long life in this beautiful, silent tomb. I have everything I was supposed to want, and it is nothing. It is ash in my mouth. Every room echoes with her laughter. Every book holds a note she might have written. I see her in the sunrise over the hills, and the memory is a physical pain.

Do not make my mistake. Do not believe that duty is always noble, or that sacrifice is always right. If you have found a love that feels like a world discovered, a love that speaks in letters and lives in libraries, fight for it. Forge a new path. A wall is only a wall until you decide to walk through it. I did not. I have paid for it every single day of my life since.

Do not let our story end here. Let it be a beginning for you.
A.”

Elara had wept silently. Leo had sat perfectly still, a tear tracking through the dust on his cheek. They had not needed to speak. The ghost of Alessandro was in the room with them, a palpable, sorrowful presence. His regret was the third party in their own strained alliance, his warning a clarion call.

Now, in the collapsing annex, that warning was a roar in Elara’s ears. History was repeating itself, not in slow, societal pressure, but in the violent, immediate threat of crushing beams and rising water.

“We have to get the documents and get out,” Leo shouted over a fresh peal of thunder. “Help me!”

Reason lost. She set the lamp on a high, dry shelf and waded in beside him. The water was shockingly cold. Together, they gripped the splintered beam. It was oak, old and waterlogged, impossibly heavy.

“On three!” he yelled. “One… two… THREE!”

They lifted, muscles screaming. The beam shifted a few inches with a sickening groan. The cabinet door was now partially clear. Leo released his hold and lunged for it, yanking the small, watertight case from within just as Elara’s strength gave way. The beam slammed back down, sending a spray of filthy water over them both.

“Got it!” He clutched the case to his chest.

A new sound filled the space—a high-pitched, sustained creaking from above. They looked up. A long crack was snaking its way across the ceiling plaster.

“Run!” Elara screamed.

They turned, but it was too late. With a sound like a cannon shot, another beam, dislodged from above, swung down. It didn’t hit them. It crashed horizontally across the only doorway, sealing the opening with a barrier of solid, twisted wood and rubble.

They were trapped.

The reality of it settled over them, colder than the water. Leo shone his flashlight around their prison. The annex was a small room, maybe fifteen by twenty feet. Their only exit was blocked by an immovable pile of wreckage. The hole in the wall was a sheer drop to the flooded garden below, made inaccessible by the jagged teeth of broken masonry. The ceiling continued to weep plaster dust.

For a moment, they just stood there, breathing heavily, the storm raging impotently around their little pocket of disaster. Then Leo, still holding the case, let out a shaky laugh. “Well. This is a twist Alessandro didn’t foresee.”

The absurdity of it, the sheer Gothic drama, broke the paralysis. Elara found herself laughing too, a thin, hysterical sound. They stumbled to the only dry island left—a small, cleared space near her restoration table, now piled with tools and displaced books. They sank onto the floor, backs against a stable-looking shelf.

Leo placed the case between them like a talisman. “Are you hurt?”

“No. You?”

“Just my pride.” He looked at the blocked door. “The main house phone line is down with the power. My mobile is on the desk in the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets..”

“Mine’s upstairs,” Elara said. The full implication dawned. Chiara was in the city for the night. The groundskeeper wouldn’t be back until dawn. They were utterly alone. “They’ll find us. Eventually. When the storm passes.”

“If the ceiling holds,” Leo said quietly.

The silence that followed was filled with the drumming rain and the ominous creaks of the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets.. They were sitting inches apart, the warmth of their bodies a stark contrast to the chill air. The adrenaline was fading, leaving a strange, hyper-real calm in its wake.

“We never finished talking about Chiara,” Elara said softly, not looking at him.

He sighed, a long, weary exhalation. “There’s little more to say. You know the deal. What you don’t know is that she came to me, the day after you arrived. She said she’d seen us in the garden. She said I looked at you the way I had never looked at her.” He picked at a splinter on the floor. “She released me from the arrangement, Elara. She said she wouldn’t be the Isabella in someone else’s tragedy. She’s not the villain. Just… another person caught in a old, bad system.”

Elara absorbed this. The complicated sympathy for Chiara she’d felt before twisted into something sharper, more poignant. “So the marriage… it’s off?”

“It was never truly on. It was a transaction. One she ended.”

“And the money?”

“Gone with it.” He gave a helpless shrug. “This,” he gestured to the case, to the crumbling room, “was the only plan left.”

The storm seemed to be pulling its fury back, the thunder rolling away into the distance, leaving only the steady, soaking rain. In the relative quiet, their breathing synchronized. The shared danger, the intimacy of their confinement, the ghost of Alessandro’s regret—it all dissolved the final barriers between them. The strategic alliance was over. There was only this: two people in the dark, with everything to lose.

“Elara,” he whispered. His voice was rough.

She turned her head. In the dim, refracted light from the lamp, she could see every detail of his face—the rain-tracked grime, the shadow of stubble, the desperate hope in his eyes. It was the face of the boy she’d loved and the man he’d become, etched with pain and longing.

“I let you go once,” he said, the words barely audible. “I did my duty. I tried to be what everyone needed. It was the greatest failure of my life. Alessandro’s letter… it wasn’t a warning. It was an indictment. Of me. I was already repeating his mistake, choosing the Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., and the city's ancient streets., the legacy, over…”

“Over us.”

He nodded, unable to speak.

She reached out then, her fingers finding his in the dark. The touch was electric, a jolt that travelled straight to her core. All the years of loneliness, the quiet ache of his absence, the fierce, defensive anger of their reunion—it all coalesced into this single, urgent point of contact.

“No more,” she said, and it was a vow.

He brought her hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to her knuckles that was more eloquent than any speech. Then he leaned in, and his mouth found hers.

It was not like their first kiss, all those years ago—a sweet, sun-drenched promise. This was a reclaiming. It was salt and rain and the bitter taste of fear transformed into a wild, defiant need. It was years of lost time poured into a single, breathless connection. She kissed him back with equal fervour, her hands coming up to cradle his face, to feel the solid, real truth of him.

The world outside ceased to exist. The storm, the ruined room, the threat of the ceiling—it all faded into a distant hum. There was only the heat of his mouth, the strong line of his back under her hands, the frantic beating of his heart against hers.

They didn’t speak. Words were useless now, relics of a past life. Their communication was in touch, in sigh, in the urgent, shared language of the body. He peeled her sodden sweater away, his hands warm and sure on her chilled skin. She fumbled with the buttons of his shirt, her fingers trembling not with cold, but with a longing so deep it felt like coming home.

They made love there on the hard, dusty floor, surrounded by the wreckage of history, with the precious case of letters beside them like a blessing. It was not gentle, but it was profoundly emotional—a furious, tender, weeping union that was as much an act of remembrance for Alessandro and Isabella as it was a celebration of their own survival. It was a promise etched not on paper, but on skin and soul. A promise to fight, to build, to choose each other, no matter the cost.

Afterward, they lay tangled together, wrapped in a dry canvas drop cloth they’d pulled from a shelf, sharing the warmth of their bodies. The lamp guttered low, painting their sanctuary in soft, golden tones. Elara’s head rested on his chest, listening to the steady, strong rhythm of his heart.

“We’ll get out,” he murmured into her hair, his lips brushing her forehead. “And we’ll do the reading. Even if it’s in a tent in the garden. We’ll tell their story.”

“Our story,” she corrected softly.

He held her tighter. “Our story.”

As dawn began to bleed a pale, grey light through the hole in the wall, the rain softened to a drizzle. They could hear distant sounds—a car engine, a shout. Rescue was coming.

Leo shifted, sitting up slightly. “I should try to signal them. Make some noise.” He went to stand, but as he moved, his foot dislodged a pile of fallen books near the collapsed wall. Something fluttered out from between the pages of a heavy, waterlogged volume.

Not paper. Parchment. Thicker, older.

Elara sat up, pulling the cloth around her. Leo bent and carefully retrieved it. It was a single sheet, folded in quarters, sealed with a blob of faded red wax imprinted with a crest—a lion and a rose. It had been hidden, preserved between the pages of a forgotten book for centuries.

The seal cracked with the lightest touch. Leo unfolded it with a reverence that made Elara hold her breath.

The handwriting was Isabella’s. But it was not the flowing, romantic script of her love letters. This was jagged, hurried, the ink blotted in places as if by tears or rain.

“My dearest Alessandro,

I write this knowing you may never read it. They are taking me to the convent at dawn. My brother has discovered everything. But this is not a letter of farewell. It is a map.

You spoke once of the old Roman conduit that runs from the well in your cellar to the river. You said it was collapsed, forgotten. My love, it is not. I have seen the entrance in the grotto behind the fallen oak. It leads to a chamber under the east wall of your garden. If your heart has not turned to stone with duty, if you still hold even a fragment of what we were in yours, meet me there. In three nights’ time. I will wait.

Do not let this be our end. Do not make a tragedy of us. Come and find me.

Forever yours,
Isabella.”

Leo’s face was ashen. He looked from the letter to the blocked doorway, to the hole in the wall, his mind racing. “The grotto… the fallen oak… it’s still there. On the boundary of the property.”

“She never gave up,” Elara breathed, awe-struck. “She had a plan. She fought until the very end.”

“And he never came,” Leo finished, the horror of it dawning. “He never got this letter. It was here, in this Present-day Verona: The decaying Rossi family villa, its private library, and the city's ancient streets., all along. He thought she accepted her fate. He thought his sacrifice was noble, but it was based on a lie. A lost message.”

The tragedy of it was so perfect, so devastating, it stole the air from the room. Their love had not been ended by society or family alone, but by a cruel trick of fate—a letter misplaced, a secret path unknown.

Voices were clear now, calling their names from the garden. A beam of torchlight cut through the dusty air.

“We’re here!” Leo shouted, his voice hoarse. “In the annex!”

But as the rescuers began to clear the rubble from the doorway, Leo didn’t move towards the sound of salvation. He was staring at Isabella’s final, desperate letter, then at the ancient, water-stained wall of the annex. His eyes traced a line along the stonework, down to where it met the flooded floor.

“Elara,” he said, his voice low and charged with a new, terrifying intensity. “The east wall of the garden. This is the east wall. This room… it was added later. It’s built over the garden’s original east wall.”

He dropped to his knees in the water, ignoring the shouts of the men now pulling at the debris. He ran his hands over the large, foundational stones at the base of the collapsed section. His fingers found a deep, regular fissure, too straight to be natural damage.

“The conduit,” he whispered. “The Roman conduit. Isabella’s way out.” He looked up at her, his eyes blazing in the dawn light. “It’s not a story in a letter. It’s real. And I think the collapse… I think it might have exposed the entrance.”

Before Elara could process his meaning, before she could shout a warning, Leo braced his hands against the large, cracked stone and pushed with all his weight. With a grating rumble that drowned out the rescuers’ calls, the stone shifted inward, revealing not solid earth, but a yawning, black void behind it—a tunnel, exhaling the cold, damp breath of centuries.

And from the impenetrable darkness within, something metallic glinted, catching the first weak ray of morning sun.
