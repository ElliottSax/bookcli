Chapter 7: The Extraction

Chapter 7: The Extraction

The wall in Liam’s bedroom had developed a mouth. It wasn’t a clean, theatrical opening, but a ragged, wet-looking patch of plaster that seemed to breathe, its edges puckered like a poorly healed wound. From it came the smell of damp soil and something sweetly rotten, like fruit left too long in a closed cupboard. Liam’s arm was submerged to the bicep. He wasn’t screaming anymore. He was just staring, his face bleached of all color, his breath coming in short, sharp hitches.

“Pull!” David roared, his feet braced against the skirting board, his hands locked around Liam’s torso. Sarah had Liam under the other arm, her fingers digging into his ribs. Oliver, sobbing silently, clung to his father’s leg, an anchor of useless weight.

The wall sucked. It was a palpable, viscous resistance, as if the plaster had turned to gluey muscle. With a final, sickening pop, Liam came free. They all tumbled backward in a heap onto the rug. Liam cradled his arm against his chest, whimpering.

Sarah scrambled for the lamp. In the jaundiced light, they saw the marks. They weren’t bruises. They were bites. Dozens of them, covering his forearm in a constellation of perfect, overlapping arcs, each one a livid purple-black, the skin unbroken but deeply indented, as if pressed by spectral teeth. They pulsed with a cold that radiated into the room.

“It… it talks,” Liam whispered, his voice raw. He wouldn’t look at his arm. He stared at the wall, which had smoothed back into innocuous, if slightly damp, plaster. “It’s been talking for days. A whisper in the pipes. In the floorboards when I try to sleep.”

David knelt, trying to examine the wounds. Liam flinched. “What does it say, son?”

Liam’s eyes, wide and glassy, finally slid from the wall to his father’s face, then past him, to where Oliver huddled. “It says… it likes the little ones best. The ones who are still soft. It says it’s hungry for the sound of a little boy’s laugh.” He swallowed, a dry, painful sound. “It told me I could go free. I could walk right out the front door and it wouldn’t stop me. All I had to do was… offer it Oliver.”

The silence that followed was thicker than the dark had been. The central heating kicked on with a muffled rumble, blowing a breath of artificially warm air over them. Sarah felt her own blood turn to ice. She pulled Oliver into her lap, covering his ears, though it was far too late.

“It’s dividing us,” she said, her voice trembling with a fury that was her last defense against sheer terror. “It’s picking us off one by one by making us do it ourselves.”

David stood, his knees cracking. He looked from Liam’s bitten arm to Oliver’s tear-streaked face, then to the closed bedroom door. The house felt watchful. “It’s not dividing us, Sarah. It’s presenting a logic. A terrible, evil logic, but a logic nonetheless. We have until midnight. We have to choose, or it chooses for all of us again.”

“We are not playing its game!” Sarah hissed, rising, Oliver clinging to her leg. “Last time we ‘chose,’ we lost Chloe’s innocence. We lost our peace. We have a pantry full of food that tastes like ash because we paid for it with a piece of our daughter’s mind! What will this cost, David? Hmm? What part of us do we trade for Liam’s arm, or Oliver’s… offer?”

“The cost of not playing is worse!” David’s composure snapped. The words echoed in the small room. “You saw what it did when we failed last month. The lights, the voices, the thing in the basement scratching at the door for three days! Chloe still wakes up screaming about the man in the wallpaper! This isn’t a moral debate, Sarah. This is a siege. And in a siege, you make hard choices to protect as many as you can.”

“Protect them for what?” Sarah’s voice broke. “To be slowly carved up and served to this house? To become like the people in those photos? Smiling ghosts?”

“To survive,” David said, the word final and hollow.

Liam looked between his parents, a silent, frantic pendulum. The bite marks on his arm throbbed in time with his heartbeat, a cold, insistent reminder. The house’s whisper was in his head now, a constant, sibilant thread: A trade. A simple trade. The small one for you. You could be free. You could feel the sun.

The hours bled away, syrupy and toxic. They moved to the living room, a family of ghosts haunting their own home. Chloe sat curled in an armchair, sketching furiously in her pad—dark, spiraling shapes that seemed to swallow the page. She hadn’t spoken since the extraction. Oliver, exhausted from fear, slept fitfully on the sofa, his head in Sarah’s lap. She stroked his hair, her fingers tracing the delicate shape of his skull beneath the skin.

David stood at the window, watching the perpetual, misty twilight of Sycamore Lane. The grandfather clock in the hall ticked, each second a hammer blow on the anvil of their nerves.

“It’s almost time,” David said, not turning around.

“We don’t have to go,” Sarah murmured into Oliver’s hair. “We can stay here. Together. Face whatever it does together.”

“And when it takes Oliver in his sleep?” David’s question hung in the air, cruel and necessary. “Or when it makes Chloe walk into a wall that doesn’t let go? Consensus, Sarah. The intercom said consensus. All of us, or none of us. That’s the rule.”

“Since when do you care about its rules?”

“Since they are the only rules that matter here!” He finally turned, his face gaunt in the dim light. “I am trying to keep this family alive. Not happy, not whole, just alive. That is the only victory left.”

Liam stood up abruptly. “I’ll go.”

They all looked at him. He was holding his bitten arm, his shoulders hunched. “To the Suite. I’ll… be the one. I’ll say it.”

“No, Liam,” Sarah began, but he cut her off, a new, harsh strength in his voice.

“It wants him, Mum. It’s been whispering it to me for days. It doesn’t just want an offering. It wants him. If we don’t give it a name, that’s who it will take. I saw it. In the wall. I felt its… preference.” A shudder wracked his frame. “I’m already marked. Maybe this is the trade. Me for him.”

It wasn’t nobility. Sarah saw the raw, animal terror in his eyes. It was the calculus of a cornered creature. Sacrifice a limb to escape the trap.

David’s expression was one of profound, weary relief. The decision had been made, lifted from his shoulders. Sarah saw it and hated him for it, hated herself for the tiny, shameful spark of the same feeling.

Chloe looked up from her drawing. “It won’t be like last time,” she said, her voice monotone. “Aunt Maggie was ready. She was tired. Liam isn’t.”

“Chloe, please,” Sarah begged.

“It’s true. The house is hungrier now.”

The clock began to chime midnight.

The walk to the Eviction Suite was a funeral procession. The hallway seemed longer, the floral wallpaper pressing in, the blooms looking more like fleshy, grasping organs in the low light. The door to the Suite was already ajar.

Inside, the green velvet drapes were drawn. The single bulb in the ceiling fixture buzzed, casting a jaundiced glow over the mahogany table and the four chairs. The speaker grille of the intercom was a dark, waiting eye.

They filed in. David, then Sarah guiding Oliver, then Liam, with Chloe trailing last. They took the same seats as before, the ritual already fossilizing. The air was cold and still, smelling of ozone and dust.

The intercom crackled to life. “The third month tenancy review is concluded. A breach of the peaceful enjoyment clause has been registered. The selection for remedial eviction is required. Please state the agreed name.”

Silence. Sarah held Oliver’s hand under the table. His palm was clammy. She looked at Liam. His head was bowed, his blond hair falling over his eyes, his bitten arm cradled in his lap. He was shaking.

David opened his mouth. Closed it. He looked at his eldest son, and for a fleeting moment, Sarah saw the father he used to be—the one who carried Liam on his shoulders, who taught him to ride a bike—drowning in the man he was now. He couldn’t say it.

“Consensus is required,” the voice intoned, neither male nor female, but horribly patient. “The selection must be unanimous.”

The pressure in the room increased, a squeezing, atmospheric dread. The bulb dimmed, then brightened. The velvet of the drapes seemed to absorb the light, deepening the shadows around them.

“We can’t,” Sarah whispered. “We can’t do this.”

Liam’s head snapped up. His eyes were red-rimmed, wild. The whispers had won. The terror of the hungry wall, the promise of freedom, the cold ache in his arm—it all coalesced into a single, desperate imperative. Survive.

“Liam,” he choked out, the word a dry sob. “Liam Miller.”

The moment hung, suspended. David flinched as if struck. Sarah let out a small, wounded sound. Oliver began to cry softly.

“Consensus verified,” the voice said. There was a faint, electronic click, like a lock disengaging. “The eviction of Liam Miller will proceed.”

Nothing happened in the room. No flash, no sound. But the change was immediate. Liam’s shaking stopped. He sat up straight, his expression emptying of fear, filling with a vacant, dreadful acceptance. He stood, his movements smooth and unnaturally calm.

“Liam?” Sarah said, rising from her chair.

He didn’t look at her. He walked to the door of the Suite, opened it, and stepped out into the hall. The family stumbled after him.

He wasn’t heading for the front door. He walked, with the steady pace of a sleepwalker, towards the basement door under the stairs—the one that was always locked, the one from which the scratching had come. As he approached, the lock turned with a heavy thunk, and the door swung inward, revealing not stairs, but an impenetrable darkness that smelled of wet stone and old iron.

Liam paused on the threshold. For a second, the house’s control seemed to slip. He turned his head, just slightly, and looked back at them. His eyes found Sarah’s, and in them was not accusation, but a profound, apologetic sorrow. And a warning.

Then he stepped into the dark. The door swung shut behind him. The lock clicked once more.

The hall was silent. The oppressive weight lifted, replaced by a ringing, sterile emptiness. From the kitchen, the familiar hum of the refrigerator resumed. The central heating vent blew warm air over their feet.

It was over.
* * *
The reward came at dawn. Sarah, who had not slept, heard the familiar, grotesque series of clicks and whirs from the kitchen. She found the countertops laden: a ham glazed with honey and cloves, a basket of perfect, crusty bread, a bowl of oranges that shone like miniature suns, a wheel of cheese, its rind dusted with what looked like edible gold leaf. The coffee maker was full of rich, aromatic brew. It was a feast fit for a celebration.

She stared at it, nausea rising in her throat. This was the price. This was the bounty paid for her son.

David entered. He looked at the spread, his face a mask of complex hunger—physical and moral. He reached for an orange, his fingers hovering over its bright skin, then pulled back as if burned.

“We need to keep our strength up,” he said, but the words had no conviction.

“Where is he, David?” Sarah asked, her voice flat. “Where did that door go?”

“I don’t know.” He wouldn’t meet her eyes. He picked up the knife and began to slice the ham, the sharp blade sawing through the tender meat with obscene ease. The smell filled the kitchen, cloying and rich.

Chloe came down later. She ignored the food. She went straight to the photo gallery in the hallway. Sarah watched her from the kitchen doorway, a piece of uneaten bread turning to paste in her mouth.

Chloe stopped before the newest frame. The one that had appeared after Aunt Maggie, which had remained empty. Now, it held a picture.

From across the hall, Sarah saw it was Liam. His school photo from last year, the one she’d packed in her suitcase. He was wearing his blue jumper, his hair neatly combed. But the house had altered it. The pleasant, slightly awkward smile she remembered was gone. In its place was a rictus of agony. His mouth was stretched wide in a silent scream, his eyes bulging with terror. The photo was in perfect, crisp color. You could see the tears tracking through the freckles on his cheeks. You could see the faint, purple echoes of the bite marks on his forearm, now visible below his sleeve.

Chloe reached out and touched the glass, her fingertip resting on her brother’s screaming mouth. She didn’t cry. She just tilted her head, studying the image with the detached curiosity of a scientist.

“It’s different,” she said, loud enough for Sarah to hear. “Aunt Maggie was just gone. Liam is still here.”

She turned to look at her mother, her eyes clear and chillingly adult.
“The house isn’t just evicting them,” she said. “It’s collecting them. And it’s keeping them awake.”
