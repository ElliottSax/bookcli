 e wall. It showed me. Oliver’s face. His little hands. His laugh. It wants to hear him scream.”

Oliver stirred, his eyelashes fluttering. Sarah’s arms tightened around him, a reflex of pure, animal instinct.

“You’re not going anywhere,” David said, his voice low. “We’re not making that choice.”

“It’s already made,” Liam said. “It’s just waiting for us to say the words. We have to. We have to, or it will take him anyway. And it will be worse. It will be slower. It will hurt him more.”

The room seemed to contract, the walls pressing in. The air was thick with the scent of old wood and something faintly metallic, like the tang of blood in the back of the throat. The grandfather clock’s ticking grew louder, each swing of the pendulum a countdown.

“No,” Sarah whispered, her fingers tightening in Oliver’s hair. “No, no, no.”

Liam’s eyes were wet, but his voice was steady. “I’m sorry, Mum. I’m sorry, Dad. I’m sorry, Ollie. But I’m not letting it have you. I’m not letting it have any of you.”

He turned toward the door, his steps slow but deliberate. The house seemed to lean in, the air growing colder, heavier. The wallpaper in the hallway rippled, the patterns shifting into something darker, something that watched.

“Liam, stop!” David’s voice was a command, but Liam didn’t pause. He reached for the doorknob, his fingers trembling.

“Liam, please,” Sarah begged, her voice breaking. “Please don’t do this.”

Liam’s hand hovered over the knob. For a moment, he hesitated, his breath coming in short, sharp gasps. Then, with a final, shuddering breath, he turned the knob and stepped into the hall.

The door clicked shut behind him.

The silence that followed was absolute. The grandfather clock’s ticking seemed to slow, each second stretching into an eternity. Sarah’s heart pounded in her ears, a drumbeat of terror and grief.

“He’s gone,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “He’s really gone.”

David stood frozen, his face a mask of shock and horror. Oliver, now fully awake, clutched at Sarah’s shirt, his small body trembling.

“He’s gone,” Oliver repeated, his voice small and broken. “Liam’s gone.”

The house seemed to exhale, a long, slow sigh that carried the scent of damp earth and something sweetly rotten. The walls pulsed, the air thick with the weight of something unseen but deeply felt.

“We have to go after him,” Sarah said, her voice trembling. “We have to bring him back.”

David shook his head, his eyes fixed on the closed door. “It’s too late. The choice is made.”

“No,” Sarah said, her voice rising. “No, it’s not. We can still fight. We can still—”

A sound cut her off—a low, guttural laugh that seemed to come from the walls themselves. The laughter grew louder, a chorus of voices that echoed through 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane. Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness.: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane. Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness., a sound that was both mocking and triumphant.

The door to the Suite creaked open, the sound a slow, deliberate groan. A cold draft seeped into the room, carrying with it the scent of decay and something else—something sweet and cloying, like the perfume of a funeral flower.

“Liam?” Sarah called, her voice barely a whisper.

There was no answer. Only the laughter, growing louder, more insistent. The walls seemed to pulse, the air thick with the weight of something unseen but deeply felt.

“Liam?” David called, his voice hoarse. “Liam, answer me!”

Still, no answer. Only the laughter, the sound of something moving in the darkness, the slow, deliberate creak of the Suite’s door as it swung wider.

Sarah stood, Oliver clinging to her leg. She took a step toward the door, her heart pounding in her chest.

“Liam?” she called again, her voice trembling. “Liam, please. Come back.”

The laughter stopped. The house held its breath, the air thick with anticipation. Then, from the darkness of the Suite, a voice answered—a voice that was both Liam’s and not Liam’s, a voice that carried the weight of something ancient and terrible.

“It’s too late,” the voice said, the words a slow, deliberate whisper. “The choice is made. The trade is done.”

Sarah’s breath caught in her throat. The voice was Liam’s, but it was also something else—something cold and hollow, something that carried the weight of 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane. Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness.: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane.

“Liam?” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Liam, please. Come back.”

The voice answered, the words a slow, deliberate whisper. “I can’t. I’m here now. I’m part of it. I’m part of 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane. Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness.: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane. Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness..”

The words hung in the air, a chilling declaration of surrender. The house seemed to exhale, a long, slow sigh that carried the scent of damp earth and something sweetly rotten.

Sarah’s heart pounded in her chest, a drumbeat of terror and grief. She took a step back, her fingers tightening in Oliver’s hair.

“No,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “No, no, no.”

The voice from the Suite answered, the words a slow, deliberate whisper. “It’s too late. The choice is made. The trade is done.”

The house seemed to lean in, the walls pressing closer, the air thick with the weight of something unseen but deeply felt. The grandfather clock’s ticking grew louder, each swing of the pendulum a countdown to something terrible and inevitable.

Sarah’s breath came in short, sharp gasps, her heart pounding in her chest. She looked at David, her eyes wide with terror and grief.

“We have to go,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “We have to leave. Now.”

David nodded, his face a mask of shock and horror. He took Oliver’s hand, his fingers trembling.

“Come on,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “We have to go. Now.”

They moved as one, their steps slow and deliberate, their hearts pounding in their chests. The house seemed to watch them, the walls pressing in, the air thick with the weight of something unseen but deeply felt.

They reached the front door, their hands trembling as they turned the knob. The door swung open, the cold night air a stark contrast to the oppressive weight of 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane. Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness.: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane. Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness..

They stepped out into the night, the door slamming shut behind them. The house seemed to exhale, a long, slow sigh that carried the scent of damp earth and something sweetly rotten.

They stood on the porch, their breath coming in short, sharp gasps, their hearts pounding in their chests. The night was silent, the air thick with the weight of something unseen but deeply felt.

“We have to go,” Sarah whispered, her voice trembling. “We have to leave. Now.”

David nodded, his face a mask of shock and horror. He took Oliver’s hand, his fingers trembling.

“Come on,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “We have to go. Now.”

They moved as one, their steps slow and deliberate, their hearts pounding in their chests. The night seemed to watch them, the air thick with the weight of something unseen but deeply felt.
