The wall showed me Oliver's face. His little hands. His laugh. It wants to hear him scream. The thought seemed to scrawl across the faded wallpaper in letters that pulsed with a life of their own. Sarah shiver run down her spine as she gazed at the image, the skin on her arms prickling into goosebumps.
The faint scent of old wood wafted up from the floorboards, mingling with the tang of something metallic – like the faint taste of blood in the back of her throat. The air seemed heavy with anticipation, and the grandfather clock's ticking grew louder, each swing of the pendulum a countdown to something terrible.
Oliver stirred, his eyelashes fluttering as he fought to wake up. Sarah's arms tightened around him, a reflex of pure, animal instinct. She could feel his heart beating against hers, a steady rhythm that seemed to falter for a moment before picking up speed.
"You're not going anywhere," David said, his voice low and steady. He stood beside the bed, his eyes fixed on the wall as if he could will the image to disappear.
"It's already made," Liam said, his voice barely above a whisper. "It's just waiting for us to say the words. We have to. We have to, or it will take him anyway. And it will be worse. It will be slower. It will hurt him more."

The room seemed to shrink, the walls pressing in on them like a vise. The air was thick with the weight of their fear, and the grandfather clock's ticking seemed to grow louder, each swing of the pendulum a countdown to something terrible and inevitable.
"No," Sarah whispered, her fingers tightening in Oliver's hair. "No, no, no." She wave of nausea wash over her, her stomach churning with a mix of fear and grief.
Liam's eyes were wet, but his voice was steady. "I'm sorry, Mum. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry, Ollie. But I'm not letting it have you. I'm not letting it have any of you."

He turned toward the door, his steps slow but deliberate. The house seemed to lean in, the air growing colder, heavier. The wallpaper in the hallway rippled, the patterns shifting into something darker, something that watched. The shadows seemed to grow longer, twisting and writhing like living things.
As Liam reached for the doorknob, his fingers trembling, Sarah jolt of fear run through her. "Liam, stop!" David's voice was a command, but Liam didn't pause. He hesitated for a moment, his breath coming in short, sharp gasps, before turning the knob and stepping into the hall.
The door clicked shut behind him, and the silence that followed was absolute. The grandfather clock's ticking seemed to stretch each second into an eternity, and Sarah's heart pounded in her ears, a drumbeat of terror and grief.
"He's gone," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "He's really gone."

David stood frozen, his face a mask of shock and horror. Oliver, now fully awake, clutched at Sarah's shirt, his small body trembling.
"He's gone," Oliver repeated, his voice small and broken. "Liam's gone."

The house seemed to breathe, a long, slow sigh that carried the scent of damp earth and something sweetly rotten. The walls pulsed, the air thick with the presence of something unseen but deeply felt. It was a presence that seemed to press in on them, making the air feel thick and heavy.
"We have to go after him," Sarah said, her voice trembling. "We have to bring him back."

David shook his head, his eyes fixed on the closed door. "It's too late. The choice is made."

"No," Sarah said, her voice rising. "No, it's not. We can still fight. We can still find a way to—"

A sound cut her off – a low, guttural laugh that seemed to come from the walls themselves. The laughter grew louder, a chorus of voices that echoed through the house, a sound that was both mocking and triumphant.
The door to the Suite creaked open, the sound a slow, deliberate groan. A cold draft seeped into the room, carrying with it the scent of decay and something else – something sweet and cloying, like the perfume of a funeral flower.
"Liam?" Sarah called, her voice barely a whisper.
There was no answer. Only the laughter, growing louder, more insistent. The walls seemed to pulse, the air thick with the presence of something unseen but deeply felt.
"Liam?" David called, his voice hoarse. "Liam, answer me!"

Still, no answer. Only the laughter, the sound of something moving in the darkness, the slow, deliberate creak of the Suite's door as it swung wider.
Sarah stood, Oliver clinging to her leg. She took a step toward the door, her heart pounding in her chest.
"Liam?" she called again, her voice trembling. "Liam, please. Come back."

The laughter stopped. The house held its breath, the air thick with anticipation. Then, from the darkness of the Suite, a voice answered – a voice that was both Liam's and not Liam's, a voice that carried the weight of something ancient and terrible.
"It's too late," the voice said, the words a slow, deliberate whisper. "The choice is made. The trade is done."

Sarah gasped. The voice was Liam's, but it was also something else – something cold and hollow, something that carried the hunger of 13 Sycamore Lane.
"Liam?" she whispered, her voice barely audible. "Liam, please. Come back."

The voice answered, the words a slow, deliberate whisper. "I'm not Liam anymore. I'm part of it. I'm part of 13 Sycamore Lane."

The words hung in the air, a chilling declaration of surrender. The house seemed to exhale, a sigh that carried the scent of damp earth and something sweetly rotten.
Sarah's heart raced, a drumbeat of terror and grief. She took a step back, her fingers tightening in Oliver's hair.
"No," she whispered, her voice trembling. "No, no, no."

The voice from the Suite answered, the words a slow, deliberate whisper. "It's too late. The choice is made. The trade is done."

The house seemed to press in around them, the air heavy with an unseen presence. The grandfather clock's ticking grew louder, each swing of the pendulum counting down to something terrible and inevitable.
Sarah's breath came in short, sharp gasps, her heart racing in her chest. She looked at David, her eyes wide with terror and grief.
"We have to go," she whispered, her voice shaking. "We have to leave. Now."

David nodded, his face frozen in shock and horror. He took Oliver's hand, his fingers trembling.
"Come on," he said, his voice barely audible. "We have to go. Now."

They moved together, their steps slow and deliberate, their hearts pounding in their chests. The house was watching them, its presence making the air feel thick and heavy.
As they reached the front door, they could feel the weight of the house's gaze upon them. The door seemed to loom before them, its surface etched with the faint outline of a face – a face that seemed to watch them with cold, calculating eyes.
They turned the knob, and the door swung open with a slow, deliberate creak. The cold night air was a stark contrast to the oppressive feeling of 13 Sycamore Lane. The darkness seemed to swallow them whole, but it was a darkness that was almost welcome – a respite from the crushing weight of the house's presence.
They stepped out into the night, the door slamming shut behind them. The house seemed to release a sigh, a long breath that carried the scent of damp earth and something rotten.
They stood on the porch, their breath coming in short, sharp gasps, their hearts still racing. The night was silent, the air feeling heavy with an unseen presence.
But as they moved down the steps, the night seemed to grow quieter – the silence deepening into something almost palpable. The darkness seemed to press in around them, making the air feel thick and heavy.
They reached the end of the driveway, their hands shaking as they turned the corner. The house seemed to loom over them, its walls pressing in, making the air feel heavy.
They walked, their steps slow and deliberate, their hearts still pounding. The night was watching them, making the air feel thick and heavy.
As they moved away from the house, the darkness seemed to grow quieter – the silence deepening into something almost palpable. But Sarah knew that it was just an illusion – the house was still watching them, its presence lingering in the air like a cold, damp mist.
They walked, their steps slow and deliberate, the only sound the crunch of gravel beneath their feet. The night seemed to stretch out before them, a long, dark road that seemed to lead them further and further away from the house.
But as they walked, the darkness seemed to grow quieter – the silence deepening into something almost palpable. And in that silence, Sarah could feel the house's presence – a presence that seemed to follow them, watching them, waiting for them to return.
She knew that they would never be free of 13 Sycamore Lane – that the house would always be a part of them, a shadow that hung over their lives like a dark and foreboding cloud.
As they walked, the night seemed to grow darker – the shadows deepening into something almost palpable. And in that darkness, Sarah knew that they were not alone – that the house was still with them, watching them, waiting for them to return.
