# Chapter 5: The Gift and the Debt

The silence after the Wilsons were evicted was not peaceful. It was a held breath, thick and expectant, tasting of dust and dried tears. For three days, 13 Sycamore Lane absorbed their absence. The floorboards seemed to swell with a terrible satisfaction underfoot. The air grew denser, warmer, as if the house were digesting.
The first gift came on the fourth morning. David, moving through the fog of his own shame—a metallic taste at the back of his throat that no coffee could wash away—went to the front door for the newspaper. Parked in the driveway, gleaming under a weak autumn sun that appeared to spotlight it alone, was a car. Not just any car. A vintage Jaguar XK120, its cream paintwork flawless, its chrome bumpers shining like surgical instruments against the grey gravel. The keys, heavy and cold, hung from the lion-head knocker. David’s breath caught in a dry rattle. It was the car from the sepia photograph in his study, the one he’d stared at as a boy in his grandfather’s garage, tracing the elegant curve of its fender with a grimy finger. A ghost made metal. He reached out, his fingers trembling, and touched the hood. It was warm, as if it had been driven hard and fast just moments before.
*It knows*, he thought, a thrill of horror and delight twisting in his gut. *It knows the hidden museum of my wants.*

Inside, the luxury continued with a predator’s precision. For Chloe, a matte black box from a designer she followed with hungry, scrolling eyes appeared on her made bed. Not a knock-off, not a sample. The full autumn collection: a silk dress the colour of bruised twilight, shoes that seemed crafted from crystal and shadow, a handbag with a clasp shaped like a skeletal leaf. The silk whispered as she lifted it, cool as a secret against her skin. She put the dress on and stood before her full-length mirror, which now reflected her with a sharper, more predatory beauty, erasing the faint shadows under her eyes. She looked like the version of herself she posted online, airbrushed and untouchable. She didn’t smile. She simply stared, her fingers tracing the impossibly fine stitching, wondering if it was thread or spider-silk.
*This is what you wanted*, a voice that was not quite her own murmured in her mind. *To be flawless. To be desired. This is the price of being seen.*

The house was courting them, a suitor with endless resources and no concept of ‘no.’ The heat always settled at the perfect temperature, a constant, womb-like embrace. Meals left half-finished in the kitchen were gone by morning, the plates clean and put away without a sound. The faint smell of lemon polish and old books was now undercut by the scent of their individual preferences: David’s forgotten pipe tobacco (though he hadn’t smoked in years), Chloe’s jasmine perfume, the crisp ozone smell of Liam’s gaming computer. It was an attentive, suffocating lover, learning their rhythms by heart.
And it was poisoning them.
Liam stopped eating at the table. He’d take his plate—always his favourite foods, perfectly prepared, the macaroni cheese golden and bubbling, the steak exactly medium-rare—to his room, his eyes accusing slits above his headphones. When he did speak, it was shrapnel.
“Enjoying the car, Dad?” he’d sneered as David polished the Jaguar’s fender with a reverent cloth, the act a desperate, repetitive prayer. “Cost us a family, but hey. Leather seats.”

David would flinch, the joy of the machine turning to ash in his mouth. “Liam, we didn’t have a choice. We were drowning.”

“We always have a choice,” Liam would spit back, retreating into 13 Sycamore Lane, which now more like his ally than his parents were. The Wi-Fi was always blisteringly fast for him.
Oliver had withdrawn into a silence so complete it was a physical presence, a bubble of quiet that muted sound around him. He spent hours in the hallway, standing before the gallery of tenant photos. His small head tilted, as if listening to a distant song. His eyes, wide and unblinking, tracked from one framed tragedy to the next: the smiling couple of the 40s, the grim family of the 70s, the single woman from the 90s. His thumb was permanently in his mouth, a habit he’d broken at age two. Sarah would try to lead him away, to coax him with toys or sweets that miraculously appeared in the cupboards—sweets from her own childhood, in wrappers long discontinued. He’d go limp, a dead weight, until she released him, and he’d drift back to his post.
Sarah’s own change was the most visceral. The petrification of her right hand had ceased its spread, holding at the second knuckle. The skin was cold, grey, and hard as soapstone, utterly without sensation. She kept it gloved in a soft leather she’d found in a drawer, but the dead weight of it was a constant reminder, pulling her off-balance. One afternoon, overwhelmed by the cloying, perfumed air of the sitting room, she stumbled into the cool, plain hallway, leaning against the wallpaper. As her petrified fingers brushed the floral pattern, she it.
A vibration. A deep, sub-aural pulse, like the slow heartbeat of a buried leviathan. And cold—a cold that seeped through the stone of her fingers and into the marrow of her arm. She jerked her hand back. The sensation vanished. Heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird, she slowly pressed her stone fingertips back against the wall.
*Thump… thump… thump…*

It was in the walls. In the bones of 13 Sycamore Lane. A living, pulsing presence. She could feel its rhythm, sluggish and patient, utterly alien. When she touched the wall with her living flesh, she nothing but paper and plaster. The house only revealed its heartbeat to the part of her that belonged to it.
“David,” she whispered that night in bed, the darkness pressing in on them like a coffin lid, so complete ito swallow the sound of her voice. “It’s alive. I can feel it. In the walls.”

He lay stiff beside her, staring at the ceiling where the shadows never seemed appeared to, always shifting at the edge of vision. “Don’t,” he said, his voice hollow, echoing in the vast space between them. “Just don’t, Sarah. We can’t think like that. We have to be grateful. We’re safe. We have everything.”

“We have *nothing*,” she breathed back, the words sharp with despair. “Our son looks at us like we’re monsters. Our other son is turning to stone while he sleeps. We have nothing but a beautifully wrapped nightmare.”

But 13 Sycamore Lanedemanded gratitude, and its method was relentless generosity. The guilt curdled their love, turned every interaction into a transaction. Chloe, draped in her new silks, became a ghost in her own home, floating from room to room, touching things as if to confirm they were real. The gifts were anchors, beautiful, heavy anchors chaining her to the horror.
It was David who found the ledger. He was in the study, trying to lose himself in the Jaguar’s manual, the smell of old paper and leather a poor comfort, when a section of the bookshelf behind the desk clicked with a sound like a cracking knuckle and swung inward an inch. His blood ran cold, a slush of ice in his veins. Behind the shelf was a small, dark cavity smelling of damp earth and dry rot. Inside, on a bare wooden shelf, lay a single, leather-bound book.
It was old, the leather cracked and dry like a serpent’s shed skin. The pages were vellum, the handwriting a variety of styles and inks, growing more modern as he flipped with numb fingers. It was a list. Names. Dates. And a single, stark column titled “Offering.”

*Alistair & Eleanor Finch. 10.1947 – 09.1948. Offering: Firstborn son, Theodore.*
*Marcus Green. 01.1955 – 12.1955. Offering: Sanity.*
*The Henderson Family. 03.1972 – 02.1973. Offering: Patriarch (James).*

On and on. Twelve entries. Each tenancy lasted exactly one year. Each entry ended with a terrible, final payment. The last entry was their own.
*The Reed Family. 09.2023 – Present. Offering: [Blank]*

The blank space after their name was the most terrifying thing on the page. It was a question. A menu of atrocities. David’s eyes, dry and burning, scanned the previous offerings again. *Voice. Sight. Spouse. Legacy. Breath.* The specifics varied, but the calculus was the same: a pound of flesh, tailored to the tenant, paid in monthly installments of fear and corruption until the final, catastrophic withdrawal at the term’s end.
He slammed the book shut, the sound like a gunshot in the quiet room. He shoved it back into the cavity and pushed the shelf closed, his palms slick with sweat. Now he knew. They weren’merelyst paying rent. They were filling a ledger with pieces of their souls. And they were only on entry two of twelve.
The knowledge became a rot inside him, festering. He watched Chloe admire her reflection in the hall mirror, saw the way 13 Sycamore Lane-lights seeme her, and he thought: *What will it take from you? Your vanity? Your future?* He saw Liam’s furious, betrayed eyes and thought: *Is he an entry? ‘Offering: The son who defied.’* He looked at Sarah’s gloved hand and knew, with a certainty that chilled his soul, that her petrification was just the opening bid, a down payment on a much larger debt.
Paranoia took hold at 13 Sycamore Lane, growing like a dark presence. The family started locking their bedroom doors at night, the soft click of the bolt a feeble attempt at security. Conversations were hushed, with lips barely moving and eyes darting nervously around the room, as if the house itself was listening. And it was. The air would grow still when they spoke of it, with a faint scent of ozone hanging in the air, like something was paying attention.
Chloe most trapped. Her fancy clothes suffocating, the silk choking her. She needed fresh air, not the stale air that smelled of memories and desires. One afternoon, she walked out the front door, down the garden path lined with perfectly manicured late roses, and toward the wrought-iron gate at the end of the drive. She wanted to walk to the village, buy a coffee from a real person, and feel the sun on her skin without the filter of the sycamore trees.
When she reached the gate, she pushed it, but it wouldn't budge. She rattled it, but the iron was cold and unyielding. The latch was open, but it was as if an invisible barrier had been erected across the boundary. She pressed her palms against it, feeling a cool, slightly yielding surface, but it was immovable. She walked along the low stone wall, hands outstretched, her shoes crunching on the gravel. The barrier was everywhere, a perfect, invisible enclosure around the property. The world outside - the road, the distant hedgerow, the sky - seemed like a painting, visible but out of reach. She like she was in a trap, a gilded cage.
Chloe sank to her knees on the gravel, her dress pooling around her, now dirty. She didn't scream, just silent, shuddering understanding that vibrated through her bones. They weren't tenants, they were prisoners. Being kept.
That night, the house was watching them more closely than usual. A fire crackled in the grate without being lit, casting dancing shadows on the walls. Dinner was a rich coq au vin, but the aroma that usually comforted them now overwhelming. They ate in silence, the clinking of cutlery on bone china unbearably loud. Oliver just stared past them, his eyes fixed on the dark doorway to the hall.
Sarah couldn't take it anymore. The tension in the room, the fear of the unknown, the feeling of being trapped, all came together in a desperate need to break the silence. "We have to talk about this," she said, her voice cracking.
"Talk about what?" David replied, his eyes fixed on his plate, avoiding the perfectly cooked chicken.
"The ledger, David, the barrier," Sarah said. "We're trapped. We're feeding it something, and I don't know what."

Liam pushed his food around his plate, his appetite gone. "It gave us everything," he said, his sarcasm hiding a deep hurt. "We gave it the Wilsons. Seems like a fair trade to me."

Sarah slammed her hand on the table. "It's not fair," she cried. "It's evil. It's making us complicit. It's turning us into our own jailers."

Chloe's voice was flat, dead. "What's the alternative, Mum? Starve? Go back to the flat with the mold and the bailiffs? At least here we have nice things." She fingered the silk at her throat, a nervous habit.
Sarah shouted, "These things are killing us."

In the silence that followed, a small, rusty sound emerged, like a door creaking open. They all turned to see Oliver, who had taken his thumb out of his mouth. He looked at them, his gaze clear and focused for the first time in weeks, but it was a focus that saw right through them. He walked to the doorway to the hall and pointed at the gallery of photographs.
They held their breath. The fire popped.
Oliver spoke, his voice a dry whisper, each word perfectly clear. "Baxter says it's lonely."

A chill swept through the room. Baxter, the Wilson's boy, the one they had evicted. Oliver turned to Sarah, his eyes ancient and knowing. "It wants the next one to come play."

He pointed again, this time at the blank space on the wall, waiting for the thirteenth photograph. A space perfect for a family portrait.
*Their* photograph.
Then his face went slack again, the dreadful light in his eyes snuffed out as as a candle. He put his thumb back in his mouth and wandered back to his chair, climbing up with a childish clumsiness that was now horrifying in its normalcy. He left his family frozen in the gilded, perfumed, horrifying silence of their dining room, the feast before them reeking of decay.
The hook had been set, buried deep. The house had spoken through the only mouthpiece they could still trust, using the voice of the innocent to deliver its ultimatum. The gift had been given. Now the debt was being called, and the terms were being spelled out in the simple, devastating language of a child.
The next offering was due. Not a pound of flesh, but a soul. A playmate. And 13 Sycamore Lane, lonely and patient in its pulsing walls, was waiting to play its favorite game.
