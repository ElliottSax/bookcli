  "title": "The Tenancy of 13 Sycamore Lane",
  "genre": "horror",
  "subgenre": "haunted house",
  "premise": "A desperate family wins a year's rent-free tenancy in a historic mansion through a mysterious lottery they never entered. The house provides for their every material need, but its contract has a hidden, supernatural clause: for each month they survive, one of them must be willingly 'evicted' by the others. The house is not trying to kill them\u2014it's forcing them to decide who gets to live.",
  "protagonist": "Maya Chen, a pragmatic social worker and mother who must use her knowledge of family trauma and crisis negotiation to outmaneuver both the house's psychological manipulations and her own fracturing family.",
  "conflict": "The family is trapped in a gilded cage where survival depends on sacrificing one of their own each month. The central conflict is internal and external: fighting the house's insidious influence that preys on their secrets and resentments, while battling each other to avoid being the next vote for 'eviction'\u2014a fate that doesn't mean death, but something the house calls 'permanent residency' within its walls.",
  "setting": "Present-day, in the deceptively luxurious and ever-shifting Victorian mansion at 13 Sycamore Lane, located in a fog-enshrouded, forgotten suburb that doesn't appear on any map.",
  "tone": "Claustrophobic, psychologically oppressive, and morally fraught, blending domestic dread with the chilling logic of a supernatural contract. The horror stems less from jump scares and more from the inevitable, calculated unraveling of familial love under extreme duress."
