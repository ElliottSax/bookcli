Chapter 2: The First Provision

Chapter 2: The First Provision

The silence of 13 Sycamore Lane was not empty. It was a held breath, a plush, suffocating quiet that absorbed sound the way the deep carpets absorbed their footsteps. For the first week, the Hargraves moved through the rooms like museum visitors, afraid to touch the gleaming surfaces. But hunger—for normalcy, for security, for a taste of the life they’d been promised—soon overcame caution.

David’s sanctuary was the study. It was a room of dark, rich wood and leather that smelled of old paper and beeswax. On the third morning, he went in simply to escape the echoing vastness of the living room, to sit in the high-backed chair and stare at nothing. The mahogany desk was bare except for a sleek, modern pen resting on a green leather blotter. He picked it up, idly, and as he did, the top drawer, which had been perfectly seamless the day before, now sported a small, brass pull. It slid open without a sound.

Inside lay a single sheet of heavy cream paper. The letterhead was embossed, deep and crisp under his thumb: “Verner & Stirling, Architectural Preservation.” His eyes scanned the words, not comprehending at first. Then his heart began a slow, hard thud against his ribs. It was an offer of employment. Senior Historical Consultant. The salary was a number he would have laughed at a month ago—a number that, after the ruin of his own firm, felt like a divine pardon. The benefits were exhaustive. The start date was the following Monday. It cited his “unique suitability” for a portfolio of properties in the county, including, he noted with a cold trickle down his spine, the “Sycamore Lane Estate.”

He hadn’t applied. He hadn’t sent out a resume since the move. He sat there for an hour, the paper trembling in his hands. The rationalizations came, clumsy and eager: a headhunter had found him, the house’s previous owners had connections, it was a miraculous coincidence. By the time he brought the letter to Sarah, his initial dread had been sanded down into a giddy, disbelieving relief. “We’re back,” he kept saying, crushing her to him in the sun-drenched kitchen. “We’re back, Sarah.”

Sarah’s gift was quieter, more intimate, and therefore more chilling. She had been unpacking the last of her jewelry—costume pieces, mostly, the few real things sold long ago. She’d sighed, thinking of her grandmother’s locket, a simple silver thing lost in the chaotic, hurried sale of their old home. A stupid thing to mourn amidst the loss of everything else, but it was a specific, sharp ache. That night, as she prepared for bed in the master bathroom (marble so vast and white it felt surgical), she felt a draft from the bedroom. The French doors to the balcony were shut tight. She walked back in, and there it was.

The locket lay centered on her dresser, on a velvet tray she didn’t own. The chain was coiled neatly, the silver polished to a soft moon-glow. She didn’t scream. She approached it as one would a sleeping spider. Her fingers, when she picked it up, were numb. It was cold. It was hers. The tiny, familiar scratch on the clasp from when she’d dropped it in a sink as a girl was there. She fastened it around her neck, the metal warming quickly against her skin. A comfort and a violation, perfectly blended. When David saw it the next morning, he smiled. “Found it! That’s wonderful, love.” He didn’t ask where. She didn’t offer.

Chloe’s tuition was paid in full. The notification arrived via an email so bland and official-looking she almost deleted it as spam. But there it was, from the bursar’s office: “Outstanding balance settled. Source: Private Educational Grant (Sycamore Trust).” She stared at the screen of her laptop, the joy curdling in her stomach. She’d confessed her fears about student loans just two nights before, at dinner, in this very dining room under the cold gaze of a crystal chandelier. The house had been listening. She showed her parents, her voice thin. “This is the ‘provision,’ isn’t it?” David waved a hand, buoyant from his own news. “It’s a grant, Chloe. A blessing. Don’t look a gift horse.”

Liam’s desire was the most blatant. He’d spent an evening watching tech reviews on his phone, muttering about the “Arcturus IX” gaming rig, a ludicrously expensive, liquid-cooled beast. “It’s just a fantasy,” he’d grumbled to the empty lounge. The next afternoon, returning from a walk he’d taken just to get out of the oppressive quiet of the house, he found his bedroom transformed. The old desk was gone. In its place stood the Arcturus IX, its chassis a labyrinth of glowing cyan coolant and polished black steel. The monitors were vast, curved voids. It was humming, softly, ready. He didn’t whoop or cheer. He sank into the ergonomic chair that had also appeared, his skin prickling. He powered it on. It was already configured, logged into all his accounts. A single text file was open on the main screen. It read: “Enjoy the immersion.” He played for eight hours straight, the game’s digital violence a welcome distraction from the real, quiet violence of the gift.

Only Oliver remained untouched by the house’s generosity. He roamed the halls, a small, silent ghost in pajamas that were suddenly too big. He didn’t ask for toys. He didn’t mention friends. He drew. The house provided beautiful, heavy art paper and thick, expensive pencils that never broke. His drawings, however, were not of the soaring ceilings or the grand staircase.

They were family portraits. But they were wrong. The first one, found crumpled in the sunroom, showed the five of them as stick figures, standing in front of a tall, rectangular house. All were smiling wide, toothy grins. Above them, Oliver had written in clumsy capitals: MONTH 1. The next day, a new drawing appeared on the fridge, held by a magnet shaped like a grinning cat. Same family, same house. This time, a figure on the end—a tall stick figure meant to be David—was violently crossed out with a furious scribble of black. MONTH 2. The day after that, another. This time, the figure next to David, Sarah with her curly hair, was crossed out. MONTH 3.

“It’s a game, sweetheart,” Sarah said, kneeling before him in the playroom that felt as used as a hotel lobby. “A silly counting game, right?” Oliver looked at her with his old-man eyes, then slowly shook his head. “The house is counting,” he said, and went back to shading the roof a dark, oppressive grey.

The drawings prompted the first family meeting. They gathered in the living room, a space so large their voices didn’t echo so much as get swallowed. Chloe hugged a cushion. Liam slouched, fingers twitching for his keyboard. Oliver sat on the floor, arranging his drawings in a line.

“We need to talk about this,” Sarah began, her voice tight. “The… things that are happening.”

“Good things,” David insisted. He was standing by the fireplace, a lord of the manor. “A job, Sarah. Security. Chloe’s future. These are the provisions we were promised.”

“And the locket? Appearing out of thin air?”

“We must have packed it without realizing.”

“I didn’t. David, listen to yourself. Liam’s computer?”

Liam shrugged, not meeting anyone’s eyes. “It’s just a computer.”

“It’s a manifestation,” Chloe cut in, her voice sharp. “It’s reading our wants and giving them to us. That’s not normal. That’s… transactional.”

“And what about Oliver’s pictures?” Sarah’s question hung in the air.

They all looked at the row of drawings on the Persian rug. Month 1. Month 2. Month 3. Month 4. A family being systematically erased.

David sighed, the sound full of paternal patience. “Ollie, buddy. We know the last year was really scary. Moving all the time, mom and dad fighting about money. This is our fresh start. No one is going away. No one is getting… crossed out.” He walked over and scooped Oliver up. The boy went rigid in his arms. “He’s externalizing his old anxiety. It’s a classic trauma response. We’ll get him a therapist here. A good one. The house… the stability here will help him.”

The meeting dissolved with David’s rationalizations forming the official family line. The house was generous. They were lucky. Oliver was processing. Everything was fine. The unspoken agreement was a membrane stretched taut over their fear; to puncture it was to admit they had made a catastrophic mistake.

It was Liam who discovered the absences. Bored of his gifted paradise, he’d decided to explore, treating the house like a dungeon in one of his games. He came back to the kitchen, where Sarah was mechanically washing already-clean dishes.

“Where’s the basement?” he asked.

Sarah didn’t look up. “There’s a door off the mudroom, I think.”

“There isn’t. I checked. There’s just a wall. And where’s the attic? There should be a hatch in a ceiling somewhere. I’ve been in every room. There’s nothing.”

A cold knot tightened in Sarah’s stomach. She dried her hands and followed him. The mudroom wall was smooth, plastered and painted a perfect eggshell, uninterrupted by trim or seam. It felt solid when she knocked. In the second-floor hallway, where an attic access should have been, there was only more ceiling, crowned with an ornate medallion.

“Maybe it’s sealed off,” David said when they told him over dinner. “Old houses, sometimes they close up unused spaces. For insulation. Or pests.”

“Without a trace?” Sarah whispered. “Without even a hint of a door?”

The house seemed to listen. That night, as they slept, the silence deepened, becoming a physical pressure. Sarah dreamed of smooth, featureless walls closing in, soft as velvet, inescapable. She woke with a gasp to find David asleep beside her, a smile on his face. She reached for her locket, its familiar shape now feeling like a brand.

The morning of their thirtieth day dawned grey and still. The weather, they were learning, was often muted here, as if the house demanded all the atmosphere for itself. Sarah was the first into the hallway, heading for the kitchen to make coffee she wouldn’t drink.

She stopped, her breath catching in her throat.

Halfway down the long, carpeted corridor, where yesterday there had been nothing but wallpaper and a mediocre landscape painting, now stood a door.

It was utterly foreign. The other doors in the hall were six-panel, painted a soft white. This one was made of a dark, deeply stained oak, carved with intricate, interlocking patterns that seemed to shift if you didn’t look at them directly—geometric vines, spirals that hinted at faces, shapes that evoked both keys and teeth. It had a heavy, black iron ring for a handle. And just above eye level, set into the wood, was a small, rectangular plaque of tarnished brass.

Sarah approached, her bare feet silent on the carpet. The air around the door was several degrees cooler. She could smell old wood and a hint of damp stone, smells that had no place in the sterile, climate-controlled air of the house.

She read the plaque. The words were engraved in a crisp, serif font:

EVICTION SUITE

Her hand rose, trembling, towards the iron ring. She didn’t want to touch it. She needed to touch it. Her fingers were an inch from the cold metal when a voice shattered the silence.

“Mom?”

She whirled around. Oliver stood at the end of the hall, clutching his latest drawing. His small face was pale.

“Don’t,” he said, his voice clear and terrible. “It’s not for you. Not yet.”

From downstairs, the smell of coffee began to waft up, automatic and perfect, from the smart machine David had programmed. A shower turned on in the master suite. The house was waking up, tending to their comforts.

But here, in the growing chill of the hallway, the new door waited. It had not been opened. It had simply arrived, the first line of a new and terrible paragraph in their tenancy. The provision period was over. The house was now ready to discuss the terms.
