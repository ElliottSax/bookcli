Chapter 6: The Candidate

Chapter 6: The Candidate

The house, after its feast, had entered a period of exquisite cruelty. It was no longer a blunt instrument of terror, but a surgeon, its scalpel honed on the fragile ligaments of family. The reward—the inexplicable deposit in their bank account, the pristine new car in the drive, the sudden, universal approval of Elara’s college applications—was the anesthetic. The operation had already begun.

Liam was the infection. The house had decided.

It started with the cold. His room, the smallest, overlooking the skeletal sycamore, became a meat locker. No matter how high the central heating roared in the rest of 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane.

Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness., his space remained frigid. Condensation froze into delicate, morbid patterns on the inside of his windowpanes. His breath plumed in the air, and his electric blanket died a silent death, its controls fused into a useless plastic lump. When he complained, shivering at the breakfast table, the vent above him sighed a wave of warmth so sudden it made him sweat, while the rest of the family sat in comfortable equilibrium.

“Maybe you’re running a fever, sweetie,” Marianne had said, her hand on his forehead. Her touch was brief, clinical. “You feel clammy.”

Then came the music. His prized vinyl, his carefully curated records, would spin on his turntable of their own volition, the needle dropping in the dead of night. Not his usual punk or obscure post-rock, but the saccharine pop his sister secretly loved, or the dreary classical his father played during Sunday paperwork. It would blare, the volume knob twisted to its limit, shaking the walls until someone—Mark, bleary-eyed and furious, or Elara, hissing about her sleep—stomped in to rip the plug from the wall. The record would be spinning silently, Liam “asleep” in his bed, the culprit obvious.

“This isn’t funny, Liam,” Mark had growled the third time, his silhouette filling the doorway. “We’re all under enough strain.”

Liam’s protests were breathless, desperate. “I didn’t! I was asleep!”

The house made him a liar.

His things began to travel. His favorite hoodie, the one with the torn pocket, was found in the garden shed, draped over the old, rusted lawnmower like a shroud. His phone charger was discovered coiled tightly in the freezer, encased in a block of ice. A notebook containing his angsty, private lyrics was left open on the kitchen table to a page describing a “plastic sister” and a “father of stone.” Elara read it, her face hardening into a mask of betrayal.

The whispers were the worst. They were just on the edge of hearing, a susurrus in the pipes, a rustle in the air vents. They used Liam’s voice, the cadence and timbre perfectly stolen. Marianne, washing dishes, heard it from the drain: She’s just waiting for you to break, Mom. She thinks you’re weak. Mark, in his study, heard it from the heating vent: He’s looking at the real estate listings again. He’s planning his exit. Elara heard it from her own bedroom wall, a secret shared: She only got into Brookdale because of 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane.

They never spoke of the whispers directly. To give them voice was to admit 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane.

Instead, the unspoken accusations thickened the air. Liam became a walking trigger. The way he cleared his throat sounded like a scoff. His silence felt like condemnation. His attempts to engage—a question about dinner, a comment on a TV show—were met with flinches and short, guarded replies.

The kitchen became the courtroom. It was where 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane.

The first of the month had passed with no new penalty, only that chilling, lavish reward. But the pressure was building. The third month’s deadline was a storm cloud on the horizon. Unanimity. The word hung over them, a sickening ideal.

One Tuesday, the warfare escalated to the mundane, to the visceral. Marianne had made shepherd’s pie, Liam’s favorite, a peace offering to herself as much as to him. She placed his plate before him, the cheesy potato crust golden and bubbling. As he lifted his fork, the smell turned. Not to rot, but to something chemical, alien. The beef filling beneath the surface had transformed into a gray, gelatinous sludge. On Liam’s plate only. The rest of the family’s meals steamed, perfectly normal.

Liam dropped his fork. It clattered on the porcelain, a shockingly loud sound.

“What?” Marianne asked, her voice tight.

“It’s… it’s gone off,” he mumbled, pushing the plate away.

Mark leaned over, sniffed. “Smells fine to me.”

“It doesn’t! Look at it!” Liam’s voice cracked, a fissure of panic.

Elara stabbed her own food, took a deliberate bite. “Tastes amazing, Mom. Maybe your taste buds are frozen, too. Along with your room.”

“Don’t,” Liam whispered, his eyes shining.

“Don’t what? Don’t point out that ever since we got everything we ever wanted, you’ve been acting like a spoiled, creepy little brat?” Elara’s words were a torrent, fueled by weeks of sleepless nights and the whispered lie about her talent. “Your music, your crap everywhere, the sulking… We’re all living in this, Liam! Not just you!”

“You think I’m doing this?” he shouted, standing so fast his chair screeched. “You think I like freezing? You think I enjoy hearing my own voice say things I never said?”

“We only have your word that you didn’t say them!” Mark boomed, slamming a hand on the table. The cutlery jumped. “The money, the car, Elara’s future… it’s stability, Liam. Something you seem hell-bent on destroying!”

Marianne watched, her hands pressed to her mouth. The house was so quiet, so attentively quiet, drinking their anger. “Please,” she begged, the word a faint exhalation. “Please, stop.”

But the current was too strong. Liam, cornered, tears of frustration now cutting through his anger, turned on his father. “Stability? You shoved a man out into the dark for this stability! Don’t talk to me about—”

He didn’t see Mark move. One moment his father was at the head of the table, purple with rage; the next, he was around it, his hands gripping Liam’s shoulders. It wasn’t a punch. It was a sharp, forceful shove, born of a need to silence, to physically push away the accusing truth.

Liam stumbled back, his feet tangling in the chair leg. He fell hard against the kitchen wall, the impact knocking a framed photo of a beach vacation—a lifetime ago—to the floor. The glass shattered.

The sound was like a spell breaking. Mark stared at his own hands, horrified. Elara’s defiance crumpled into shock. Marianne let out a small, wounded animal sound.

Liam slid down the wall, not hurt, but utterly broken. He looked at them—his father, the shover; his sister, the prosecutor; his mother, the silent judge—and something in his eyes solidified into a hard, black hurt. He got up, wordlessly, and walked out of the kitchen. His footsteps on the stairs were a funeral march.

No one followed. The silence in the kitchen was a living thing. Mark sank into a chair, his head in his hands. Marianne mechanically began picking up shards of glass, her tears dripping silently onto the linoleum. Elara just stared at the doorway.

The house had its unanimous moment: a shared, shameful silence.

The next morning, the verdict was on the refrigerator. The magnetic letters, once used for cheerful notes and grocery lists, had been rearranged. They formed a single, stark sentence on the gleaming stainless steel:

LIAM DISRUPTS THE UNANIMITY.

It sat between a coupon for yogurt and Elara’s Brookdale acceptance letter. A diagnosis. A condemnation.

Marianne saw it first. She didn’t scream. She simply reached out a trembling hand and swept the letters into a jumbled pile. But the message was already inscribed on their minds.

Liam came down late. He saw the scrambled letters, saw the way his family wouldn’t meet his gaze. He made a beeline for the coffee pot, his movements stiff, his face a closed door. He poured a cup, took a sip, and spat it back into the mug. It was salt. The entire carafe, just salt.

That was the final lock turning.

He didn’t yell. He turned and walked, with a terrifying calm, into the living room. He stopped before the large, unadorned wall that separated the living room from the dining room—a blank canvas of beige plaster.

“You want unanimity?” he said, his voice low and clear, not to his family but to 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane. Its interior is a maze of shifting rooms, impossible spaces, and a pervasive, warm dampness.: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane.

He drew back his fist. Marianne cried out, “Liam, don’t!”

He punched the wall.

There was no drywall crack, no splintering of studs. Instead, there was a wet, yielding thud. His fist sank into the plaster up to his wrist, as if plunging into cold, dense mud. The sensation was nauseatingly organic. A wave of pins and needles shot up his arm.

He gasped, trying to yank his hand back. It wouldn’t budge. The plaster had hardened instantly, a perfect, seamless cast around his forearm. It was warm, now. Pulsing faintly, like a throat swallowing.

“Liam!” Mark shouted, rushing forward.

Liam pulled with all his might, bracing his feet against the baseboard. Panic flooded him, sharp and metallic in his mouth. The wall held him fast. Then, it began to pull back.

It was a slow, inexorable suction. With a soft, grinding sound, the plaster crept past his wrist, encasing his forearm. He was being ingested.

“Get him out!” Marianne shrieked, clawing at the wall. Her fingers found only solid, unyielding surface. Mark grabbed Liam around the chest, planting his feet, and pulled. Elara stood frozen in the doorway, her hands pressed to her cheeks.

Liam screamed, a raw sound of pure terror. The wall was up to his bicep. The pull intensified. He felt a dreadful pressure, not just on his arm, but on his very being, as if his essence were being siphoned. The beige plaster swirled, patterns forming in its depths—flickering, nightmarish impressions of the family’s faces, twisted in anger and fear.

“It’s not letting go!” Mark roared, his face red with strain. He was losing his footing, being dragged toward the wall alongside his son.

Marianne ran to the kitchen, returning with a meat mallet. She swung it at the wall beside Liam’s imprisoned arm. The blow landed with a dull thock, not even chipping the surface. The mallet rebounded, vibrating in her hands.

The wall was at Liam’s shoulder. He was sobbing, his body at a grotesque angle. “Dad! Please! It’s eating me!”

Mark let go, frantically looking for use, for a tool, for sense where there was none. Elara finally moved, but not toward her brother. She backed away, into the hall, her eyes wide with a horrified understanding. The house was making its choice. Presenting its candidate. And a terrible, silent calculation was beginning behind her eyes—the calculation 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane.

With a final, sickening slurp, the wall took Liam’s shoulder. His head and torso were now pressed against the plaster. He turned his face, his cheek flat against the wall, his eyes rolling to find his mother. His breath fogged the surface, a tiny, temporary stain.

“Mom,” he whimpered.

Then, with a sudden, violent lurch, the wall claimed him. His head sank into the plaster as if into a viscous pool. For one second, the impression of his face remained, a screaming mask in the beige surface. Then it smoothed over, leaving the wall perfectly blank, perfectly flat, perfectly undisturbed.

Mark fell backwards, landing hard on the floor. Marianne dropped the mallet, its clatter obscenely loud in the silence. She staggered to the wall, running her hands over it, searching for a seam, a crack, a warmth. There was nothing. It was just a wall.

From deep within 13 Sycamore Lane: A deceptively charming, isolated Victorian house at the end of a quiet, dead-end lane.

A single, resonant, satisfied click.

Then, from the kitchen, the soft, familiar hum of the refrigerator compressor kicking on. And the gentle, mocking rattle of magnetic letters, rearranging themselves once more.
