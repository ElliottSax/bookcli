Chapter 4: The Unanimous Decision

Chapter 4: The Unanimous Decision

Sarah’s hand was a cold, grey stone in the warmth of the living room. She kept it tucked in the pocket of her hoodie, a lump of dead weight that pulled her shoulder into a perpetual, painful slump. The skin wasn’t cracked or scaled; it was smooth, perfect, and utterly, profoundly cold. It felt like marble that had spent a century in a deep cave. No amount of blankets, hot water bottles pressed against it by a weeping Claire, or direct fire from the gas range—a desperate, terrifying moment where Mark had to wrench her back—could raise its temperature a single degree. The fingers were curled in a gentle, unyielding arc, as if caught forever holding an invisible teacup. It was a constant, silent scream in the room.

The house, meanwhile, had grown polite. The aggressive comforts of the first month—the steaming meals, the self-pouring wine, the adjusting chairs—had retreated. Now, it was a watchful host. Lights turned on just before you entered a room, but with a faint, hesitant flicker. The hot water was always precisely the temperature you desired, which felt less like luxury and more like the house was listening to your skin. The worst was the silence. It was a thick, velvety quiet that swallowed sounds whole. Conversations died mid-sentence, absorbed by the walls. The tick of the ornate clock on the mantel was a dull, subcutaneous thud.

Mark spent days in the city library, digging through microfiche and crumbling ledgers. He found Sycamore Lane, of course. He found records of the magnificent mansion, built in 1887 by an eccentric industrialist named Alistair Finch. He found property deeds, tax records. And he found gaps. 1902-1904, no residents listed. 1931-1933, another vacancy. 1978-1980, the same. Each gap was preceded by a sale or rental to a single family. Each was followed by the house returning to a trust, the Finch Legacy Trust, before being offered again. In a society column from 1932, he found a single, chilling line about the previous tenants: “The Vogels have departed Sycamore Lane quite suddenly, leaving the Finch estate to seek new custodians for its singular charms.” In a police blotter from 1980, a single entry: “Welfare check at 13 Sycamore Lane. Property vacant. No signs of disturbance.”

The word “Selection” appeared only once, in a scanned fragment of a letter from Alistair Finch to his lawyer, dated 1899. “The terms of the Legacy are ensured by the Selection. The House must be kept in balance. One heart, one hearth, one less. It is the arithmetic of comfort.”

Mark brought the photocopies home, their chemical smell a welcome assault in the sterile air. He laid them out on the vast dining table. Claire traced the word “Selection” with a trembling finger. “One heart, one hearth, one less,” she whispered.

“It’s a count,” Mark said, his voice hoarse from silence and dread. “Every month. A subtraction.”

Tom, fifteen and armored in a fury that was just fear turned inside out, slammed his fist on the table. “So we just pick someone to throw out? Like we’re voting someone off some sick island? This is our family.”

“It’s not a person,” Claire said, her voice desperate with maternal logic. “The rule says ‘tenant.’ It doesn’t specify human tenant.”

The air in the room shifted, grew colder. Sarah, cradling her petrified hand with her good one, looked up from the sofa. “What are you saying, Mom?”

Claire wouldn’t meet her daughter’s eyes. “We… we have a pet.”

A profound, sickening silence followed. It was broken by a soft thump. Baxter, a golden retriever of ancient, gentle demeanor, had been asleep by the fire. He woke at the sound of his name, his tail giving a single, trusting thump against the Persian rug.

“No,” Tom said, standing so fast his chair screeched. “Absolutely not.”

“Tom, be practical,” Mark said, the words tasting like ash. “It’s a dog. Against one of us. Sarah’s hand is gone. What happens next month? A foot? An eye? Who gets it next?”

“So we sacrifice Baxter to buy time?” Sarah’s voice was a thin, reedy thing. “Time for what? To figure out which of us you’ll throw in next?”

“Don’t be dramatic,” Mark snapped, the pressure turning his fear into anger. “It’s a temporary measure. We get the house off our backs, we breathe, we think. We find a way out of the contract.”

“There is no way out!” Tom shouted. “Can’t you feel it? The house eats the choice. It wants this. You give it Baxter, it’ll just get hungrier.”

Claire turned on him, her face a mask of strained calm. “Would you prefer we draw straws, Tom? Should your father and I choose which of our children to make leave? Is that the morality you’re fighting for?”

The fracture was instant and absolute. Parents versus children. Pragmatism versus a doomed, youthful idealism. The alliance of survival against the alliance of the heart.

For three days, they moved around each other in the oppressive splendor like ghosts. Tom refused to speak to his parents, communicating only with Sarah through shared, grief-stricken looks. Sarah retreated into herself, stroking Baxter’s head with her good hand, flinching whenever the dog licked her stone fingers as if trying to heal them. Claire became a whirlwind of brittle activity, cleaning things that were already spotless, cooking meals the house had already perfectly prepared, trying to impose a normal order on the utterly aberrant. Mark haunted the library, searching for loopholes in Finch’s words, finding only the cold, hard logic of the ledger.

The tension was a physical presence, a fifth tenant squeezing the air from the rooms. It was in the way the fire seemed to burn too low, casting long, grasping shadows. It was in the way the house’s ambient warmth would suddenly drop a few degrees near an argument. It was feeding on them.

The turning point came on the morning of the 28th. Sarah woke screaming. The cold from her petrified hand had crept up her wrist, a band of icy, dead sensation now encircling her forearm. She could feel the line of life and death on her own skin, a creeping frontier of numbness.

They gathered in the living room, a defeated tribunal. Baxter lay at Sarah’s feet, oblivious. The sight of Sarah, pale and shivering, her arm held stiffly, broke the last of Tom’s resistance. He didn’t agree; he surrendered. His silence was heavier than any protest.

“It has to be unanimous,” Mark said, his voice hollow. “The first notice said ‘unanimous decision of the tenants.’ All of us. Or it chooses for us.”

Claire knelt before Sarah, tears finally breaking through. “Sweetheart. It’s just for a little while. We’ll get him back. We’ll find a way.”

Sarah looked at her mother, then at her own stone hand. She looked at Baxter, his liquid brown eyes full of nothing but love and the hope of a walk. A sob hitched in her chest. She gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod.

The walk to the Eviction Suite was a funeral procession. Mark carried Baxter’s favorite plaid bed. Claire held his water bowl, a ridiculous, heartbreaking formality. Tom walked stiffly ahead, his shoulders hunched. Sarah followed last, Baxter padding beside her, his nails clicking a cheerful rhythm on the polished floor, utterly at odds with the occasion.

The door to the small, plain room at the end of the north wing stood open. It looked utterly ordinary. A simple rug, a bare side table, a window looking out onto the perfectly manicured, utterly inaccessible garden.

“We just… leave him here?” Claire asked, her voice small.

“The notice said ‘present in the Eviction Suite,’” Mark recited, a man clinging to procedure as the world ended.

They filed in. The room felt neutral, expectant. Baxter sniffed the rug, circled once, and lay down on his bed with a contented sigh. He trusted them. He always had.

Tom broke. He fell to his knees, burying his face in the dog’s fur. “I’m sorry, Bax. I’m so sorry.” His body shook with silent, wrenching sobs.

Sarah knelt too, her good hand stroking his ear. “Good boy,” she whispered, her tears falling on his golden coat. “You’re such a good boy.”

Mark’s jaw was clenched so tight a muscle jumped in his cheek. Claire had turned away, her hand over her mouth, staring out the false window.

It was Mark who finally moved. He placed a hand on Tom’s heaving shoulder. “Son. We have to go.”

They backed out of the room, pulling a weeping Sarah with them. Baxter lifted his head, watching them go, his tail giving a faint, questioning wag. He didn’t get up. He trusted them.

Mark was the last one out. He met the dog’s gaze for one final, agonizing second. Then he closed the door.

There was no sound. No click of a lock, no whisper of magic, no whine from Baxter. Just the profound, swallowing silence of the house.

They stood in the hallway, frozen, waiting for a sound that didn’t come. Five seconds. Ten.

Then, a soft, final thud from the other side of the door. The sound of a body hitting a rug.

Claire gasped. Tom let out a choked cry and lunged for the door handle. It was immovable, seamless, as if it had never been a door at all, just a panel in the wall. He beat on it with his fists, screaming Baxter’s name until his voice cracked. The house absorbed the sounds, leaving only a muffled, pathetic thumping.

And then, the change.

It was immediate and overwhelming. A wave of warmth, of golden light, of the scent of baking bread and blooming lilacs washed over them. The oppressive silence shattered, replaced by a gentle, soothing hum of perfect contentment. From the living room, the faint, sweet notes of Claire’s favorite piano sonata began to play. Sarah cried out, clutching her arm. The cold, dead band around her wrist was receding, the feeling flooding back in a painful, prickling rush. The petrified hand remained stone, but the advance had halted.

The house was happy. It had been fed.

Numb, they drifted back to the living room, drawn by the music, by the warmth, by the horrific confirmation of their bargain. The fire crackled merrily. On the coffee table, four small, perfect lattas steamed in porcelain cups, each topped with an intricate foam design: a flower for Claire, a guitar for Tom, a paint palette for Sarah, a briefcase for Mark.

And on the mantelpiece, where before there had been only the clock and a tasteful vase, a new object sat.

A photograph in a simple silver frame.

They approached it slowly, a group of mourners at a new grave. It was a color picture of Baxter, taken from earlier that very day. He was lying in a patch of sun in the living room, his head on his paws, eyes half-closed in contentment. The photo was perfect, lifelike.

But the mantel was longer than they remembered. To the left of Baxter’s photo were other frames, previously unseen, shrouded in a subtle shadow they had never noticed. There was a black-and-white photo of a stern-looking tabby cat. A faded sepia image of a parrot in a ornate cage. A Polaroid, its colors bleached with age, of a small, scruffy terrier.

And to the right of Baxter’s picture, the mantel stretched on, holding three empty silver frames, waiting.

The horror was not in a jump, nor a shriek. It was in the slow, cold understanding that crystallized in the warm, fragrant, beautiful room. The evictions were not temporary. The selections were permanent. The house kept them. A gallery of loyalty, of love, sacrificed to the arithmetic of comfort.

Tom’s grief-stricken rage was gone, replaced by a hollow, infinite dread. Claire’s pragmatic relief curdled into a stomach-churning shame. Mark’s leadership shattered into the knowledge that he had presided over a betrayal, not a tactic.

Sarah stared at the photo of her dog, now part of the house’s permanent collection. She lifted her petrified, stone-cold hand and placed it against her chest, over her beating, human heart. The house’s comfort was absolute. Its logic was complete.

They had made their first unanimous decision. And they now understood, with a clarity that froze the soul, that there were eleven more frames to fill.
