The room was bathed in the faint, eerie glow of the moonlight streaming through the windows. The air was heavy with the scent of old wood and decay, and the shadows seemed to writhe and twist on the walls like living things. Sarah's good hand flailed wildly as she tried to shake off the creeping numbness, her fingers splayed out like a frozen claw. Her eyes were wide with fear, her pupils dilated as she stared at her hand in horror.
Claire rushed to her side, horror etched on her face as she saw the frosty sheen spreading up Sarah's arm. Her breath caught in her throat, and she cold dread creeping up her spine. She tried to wrap a blanket around Sarah's arm, but it was a losing battle. The numbness was spreading fast, like a dark stain spreading through the fabric of Sarah's skin.
Mark and Tom, awakened by the commotion, stumbled into the room, their faces bleary with sleep. They rubbed their eyes, trying to shake off the haze of sleep, but the scene before them was like a slap in the face. They exchanged a fearful glance, their eyes locking in a moment of silent understanding. They knew what was happening, and they knew they had to act fast.
The room was in a state of raw panic. The air was thick with tension, and the silence was oppressive, like a physical weight pressing down on their shoulders. Mark's voice was firm and urgent, cutting through the chaos. "We have to get her to the hospital," he said, his eyes fixed on Sarah's arm. "Now."

But Claire hesitated, her eyes fixed on the spreading numbness. She cold dread creeping up her spine, a sense of foreboding that she couldn't shake. "What if it's not just her hand?" she whispered, her voice barely audible. "What if it's something more serious?"

Tom stepped forward, determination etched on his face. His eyes were fixed on Sarah, his expression grim. "We can't just sit here and watch her die," he said, his voice firm. "We have to do something."

Their argument was cut short by a sudden, sharp pain. Sarah's eyes flew open, and she let out a scream of agony. Her arm was on fire, a burning sensation that was eating away at her skin. She thrashed and screamed, her body arcing off the bed as if she was being possessed by some malevolent spirit.
The room erupted into chaos. Mark and Tom rushed to her side, trying to comfort her as she thrashed and screamed. Claire stood frozen, her eyes fixed on the scene with a look of horror. She like she was watching a nightmare unfold before her eyes, powerless to stop it.
As the chaos reached its peak, the house grew quieter, the air thick with anticipation. It was as if everyone was waiting to see what would happen next, their breaths held in anticipation of the next twist in the unfolding drama. The tension was unbearable, like a living thing that pulsed and throbbed in the air.
Mark understood what was happening. He shiver run down his spine as he realized the truth. "It's not just Sarah's hand," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "It's this house. It's trying to tell us something."

Tom looked at his father, understanding dawning on his face. "What do you mean?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
Mark's eyes were fixed on the house, his expression grim. He like he was staring into the abyss, with no safety net to catch him if he fell. "I think it's trying to tell us that we have to make a choice," he said, his voice low and husky. "A choice between Sarah and something else."

The room fell silent, the only sound the heavy breathing of the people in it. Then Claire spoke up, her voice barely audible. "What do you mean, Mark?" she asked, her eyes fixed on him with a mixture of fear and curiosity.
Mark's eyes remained fixed on the house, his expression unreadable. He like he was trapped in a living nightmare, with no escape. "I think it's trying to tell us that we have to sacrifice one of our own," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "To save the others."

The room erupted into chaos again, with argument, screams, and tears all mixed together. But one thing was clear: the house had made its decision, and now it was up to the people inside to make theirs. The choice was simple, but terrible. It was a choice between life and death, between love and sacrifice. And in the end, it was a choice that would change their lives forever.
As the argument raged on, the house was waiting. The air was thick with anticipation, as if everyone was holding their breath, waiting to see what would happen next. The shadows on the walls seemed to grow longer and darker, like grasping fingers reaching out to snatch them. The house was alive, its presence pulsing and throbbing in the air like a malevolent heartbeat.
Mark's voice was barely above a whisper. "It's not just Sarah's hand," he said, his eyes fixed on the house. "It's this house. It's trying to tell us something."

But what? The question hung in the air, unanswered. The house was waiting for them to make their choice, to decide who would live and who would die. And as they stood there, frozen in terror, the house was whispering a single, chilling word in their ears: "Choose."
