Chapter 2: Devil's Bargain

The air at Blackridge Maximum Security Penitentiary didn’t just smell of bleach and despair; it tasted of it. That metallic, chemical tang coated Elara Vance’s tongue the moment the first of three heavy steel doors sealed shut behind her. Each one gave a definitive, hydraulic thunk that vibrated up through the soles of her cheap flats. Every sound felt like another nail in a coffin she’d willingly climbed into.

They processed her like contraband. Fingerprinted her again, even though her prints were already in the system from her own intake five years earlier, back in a different, softer hell. A matron with bored eyes and meaty hands patted her down with cold efficiency. The standard navy suit she’d dug out of storage felt like a costume—the wool scratchy and unfamiliar against skin grown used to prison cotton. Her newly reinstated bar card, still warm from the printer, was studied like it might be a fake.

“Attorney-client conference, Block H, Cell 23,” the guard at the final checkpoint mumbled, sliding a visitor’s badge across the pitted steel counter. “No physical contact. No passing items. Conversation is monitored and recorded. Break the rules and the visit ends. Understood?”

She felt eyes on her from every slit-windowed door they passed, a hungry attention that made her skin prickle. She kept her gaze fixed on the back of the escorting guard’s uniform, on one frayed thread near his collar.

They stopped at a plain door. Not the open visitation room with its plexiglass partitions, but a private room for legal talks. The guard shot her one last warning look, then unlocked it and pushed it open.

The room was a concrete cube, ten by ten. A bolted-down metal table, scarred with a thousand hidden messages, stood in the center. Two chairs faced each other. A single wire-reinforced window high on the far wall let in a sliver of the gray afternoon, doing nothing to lift the gloom. And in the far chair, waiting with the calm patience of a spider in its web, sat Silas Thorne.

Five years hadn’t diminished him; they’d distilled him. His dark hair was swept back from a high forehead. The orange jumpsuit should have made him look ridiculous, but instead it framed his unsettling presence. He was lean, almost gaunt, but t
