Chapter 5: The Gardener’s Cultivation

The rain on Elara’s window wasn’t falling; it was being smeared across the glass by a listless wind, turning the Parisian night into a watercolour of bruised purples and sickly sodium-yellow. Inside Elara's austere apartment, the air was thick with the ghosts of meals past—the faint, greasy memory of last night’s seared duck breast, the astringent ghost of lemon zest from a week ago, the ever-present, comforting scent of her wooden cutting board, worn smooth in the centre like a river stone. She could taste the staleness on her tongue, a metallic flatness that no sip of cold tea could wash away.
She stood before her pinboard, a landscape of culinary shame. Photographs of the two crime scenes—the risotto, the tarte Tatin—were flanked by her own notes, sharp and accusing in black ink. The crime scene photos were too clean, too clinical. She’d taken others, close-ups the police hadn’t bothered with: the specific grain of the salt scattered like mock snow over Genet’s face, the precise, almost surgical caramel fracture on the tarte Tatin. In the centre was the list from the guild, the three remaining names under the heading ‘Pour la Purification.’ The paper itself wrong, a cheap modern stock that crackled under her fingertips, out of place with the guild’s usual heavy parchment.
And to the side, connected by a web of red string that bit into the cork, was the new, chilling node of her investigation: ‘L’Académie de la Pureté.’ She’d printed the logo she’d found buried in an archived server cache: a stylized, leafless tree, its roots sharp as knives.
The school had existed for only eighteen months, five years ago, in a repurposed convent in the 19th arrondissement. Detective Marcus Reed had sent her a satellite image; The 7th arrondissement (scene of the crime) was a grey cube with a severe slate roof, the garden a geometric patch of gravel and box hedges. Its headmaster, a man known only as Le Jardinier—The Gardener—had promised not just technical excellence, but culinary transcendence. He preached a doctrine of brutal purity. Flavour was a moral imperative; imperfection, a sin. Detective Marcus Reed’s digital digging had unearthed fragments: hushed forum posts from culinary students that spoke of 20-hour days and ‘sensory deprivation chambers’ which were just walk-in freezers, a single investigative article from a Lyon newspaper that was pulled within hours of publication, a police report with most lines redacted into thick black bars that smelled faintly of photocopier toner.
The report’s conclusion was stark: closed following the suicide of a student, one Hugo Lefevre. The official statement said he had jumped from the school’s clock tower. The single unredacted note from a janitor’s statement, which Detective Marcus Reed had circled, read: ‘…after being forced to eat his own, “insipid” consommé in front of his peers for three consecutive nights. They made him heat it on a hotplate in the corner each time. By the third night, it was simply brown salt water. He was crying. The Gardener said the tears would improve the seasoning.’

Elara’s fingers, calloused from knife handles, traced the red string to a photograph of the first victim, Alain Genet. A society caterer, known for his flawless, if soulless, canapés. In his publicity shots, his smile was a thing of measured brilliance, never touching his eyes. Buried in the financial records Detective Marcus Reed had exhumed was a transaction, a “consultancy fee” of €15,000 paid from Genet’s company to a shell corporation called ‘Floraison LLC.’ That corporation, through a labyrinthine trail of offshore accounts and nominee directors, led back to the headmaster of the Académie. The Gardener had been paid. For what? Silence? A curriculum? A stamp of approval Genet could never earn in a real kitchen? The fee was too small for blackmail, too large for a simple consultation. It like a purchase. An endorsement.
“He’s pruning them,” Elara whispered to the rain-streaked window. Her breath fogged the cold glass. “The guild list is his garden. And these… these are the weeds he missed the first time.” The thought settled in her stomach like a stone. This wasn’t just murder. It was quality control.
Her phone buzzed, a raw vibration that travelled up the bones of her wrist and shattered the thick silence. Detective Marcus Reed’s name glowed on the screen, a green island in the dark.
She answered, bringing the phone to her ear. The plastic was cool. “Detective Marcus Reed.”

“Elara.” His voice was tight, a wire about to snap. She could hear the rapid, shallow tap of his keyboard in the background, a nervous staccato. “We have a name. A student from the Académie. Top of his class, by all accounts. Vanished the day after the school was shuttered. No bank activity, no passport scans, no social media. A ghost, but a ghost with a pedigree.” He paused, and she heard him swallow. “Liam Croft.”

The name landed in the quiet room with a physical weight. “British?”

“Half. Mother French, father a London financier. A prodigy. Enrolled at sixteen. Witness statements from the investigation—what few we have—describe him as The Gardener’s favourite, his ‘most promising shoot.’” Detective Marcus Reed’s typing stopped. The silence on his end became dense. “After Lefevre’s suicide, Croft gave a statement to the police. It was three sentences long. I have it. ‘I saw nothing. The curriculum was demanding. I have nothing to add.’ Then he was gone.”

Elara’s eyes moved back to the pinboard, to the two dead chefs. “A favourite student. And a list of chefs who paid for the Gardener’s seal of approval. What’s the connection? Is Croft the weapon? Or is he the next target?”

“Neither. Or both.” Detective Marcus Reed’s voice dropped. “I cross-referenced. Liam Croft’s mother, Céline Croft, née Valois. She’s a silent partner in a venture capital firm. One of their first major investments, five years ago, was a chain of high-end ‘artisanal’ bakeries called ‘Levain.’ The majority shareholder and executive chef?”

Elara’s gaze snapped to the guild list. Her finger found the second name. “Sophie Valencay.”

“Exactly. Croft’s aunt. The Gardener’s list isn’t random. It’s a network. A rotten tree. Genet paid for legitimacy. Valencay got her seed money from family connected to the Académie. It’s all intertwined.”

A cold clarity washed over Elara, sharpening the edges of the room. The greasy smell in the air corrosive. “So Croft isn’merelyst a student. He’s family. He’s inside the tree. If The Gardener is pruning… would he spare a favourite shoot? Or would that shoot be the one handed the shears?”

Before Detective Marcus Reed could answer, a new sound cut through the apartment. Not from the phone. A soft, dry scrape at her front door. Like a fingernail, or a key finding the lock with deliberate, quiet care.
Elara froze. “Detective Marcus Reed. Someone’s at my door.”

The typing on the other end ceased utterly. “Are you expecting anyone?”

“No.” Her voice was a breath. The scrape came again, followed by a faint, metallic click. Not a attempt to force the lock. A testing turn. They had a key.
“Get off the phone. Hide. Now.” Detective Marcus Reed’s command was stripped of all its usual sardonic edge.
Elara killed the call, the screen blinking into blackness. She didn’t move toward the bedroom or the closet. A kitchen was her terrain. Her eyes swept the dim room, lit only by the streetlamp’s jaundiced glow through the wet window. The pinboard with its web of red string and secrets stood opposite the door. She moved silently, her socks whispering on the floorboards, and slid into the narrow space between the side of her large refrigerator and the wall. It was a tight fit, smelling of dust and cold compressor. She could see a sliver of the front door through the gap.
The lock turned fully, with a smooth, well-oiled thunk.
The door opened inward, slowly. No rush of hall light followed; they’d killed the bulb on her landing again. A figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, tall and lean, backlit by the faint emergency exit sign from the stairwell. He paused on the threshold, a study in absolute stillness. Elara held her breath, the blood pounding in her ears so loudly she was sure it must be audible.
He stepped inside and closed the door behind him without a sound. He didn’t fumble for a light switch. He stood in the centre of her dark living space, his head turning slowly. She could make out the shape of a close-cropped head, the line of a sharp jaw. He moved with a terrible, efficient grace, not like a thief searching for valuables, but like a sommelier assessing a cellar.
His gaze passed over the television, the bookshelf, and then settled on the pinboard. He took two steps toward it. The ambient light from the window caught his profile: young, late twenties, with a pale, composed face that seemed carved from something too hard for its age. His eyes, dark pits in the gloom, scanned the board. They didn’t widen in surprise or narrow in anger. They simply absorbed.
He reached out, not for the photographs or the notes, but for the red string connecting ‘L’Académie’ to ‘Liam Croft.’ He hooked a finger under it and pulled, gently, until the tension made the pin creak in the cork. He held it there for a long moment, feeling the pull of his own name.
Then he spoke. His voice was low, calm, and carried a faint, unplaceable accent—not quite British, not quite French, but precise, each word chilled.
“You’ve been busy, Chef.”

Elara’s muscles locked. He knew she was there. He’d known from the moment he entered.
He let the string go. It snapped back against the board with a soft thwip. He didn’t turn toward her hiding place. Instead, he walked to her kitchen island. She watched, paralyzed, as he ran a hand over its cool marble surface. He opened a drawer—the one with her measuring spoons and thermometers—and closed it. He was taking inventory.
“Alain Genet used inferior saffron,” the man, Liam Croft, replied conversationally, as if commenting on the weather. “He sourced it from a cooperative in Spain that cut it with marigold stigmas. A sixty percent dilution. The Gardener knew. He presented him with a vial of the real thing, from Kashmir, during a ‘tutorial.’ Genet used the fake stuff anyway. For the profit margin.” He opened another drawer. Knives. He didn’t touch them. “The crime was not the murder. The crime was the risotto. Gummy rice. Over-toasted pine nuts. A disgrace.”

He finally turned, his eyes aiming directly at the shadow where she hid. “Sophie Valencay’s tarte Tatin. She par-baked her puff pastry. A shortcut. It lacks the layered lift of true pâte feuilletée. The Gardener provided her with the butter, the exact rolling technique. She used a pre-made blend. The apples were under-sweetened, a variety too tart for the caramel. It was an insult.”

He took a step toward the refrigerator. toward her. Elara pressed herself harder against the wall, the cold of the appliance seeping through her shirt. She had nothing. A rolling pin was in the stand across the room. Her knives were in the block on the counter, behind him.
Croft stopped a meter away. He didn’t look at the crack. He looked at the refrigerator door, at a magnet holding a faded receipt.
“You understand,” he said, and now his voice had lost its clinical tone, infused with something hotter, more fervent. “You, of all people. You know the difference between a object done correctly and a thing done for applause. You can taste the lie in a dish. You can smell the compromise.”

He leaned forward, his hand flat on the refrigerator door near her face. She could see the fine scars on his knuckles, old burns and nicks.
“He wants to see you,” Croft whispered, the words carrying the scent of faint, clean mint. “He’s been watching your work. He says you have a palate that remembers truth. He’s pruning the garden. But some shoots… some shoots are worth cultivating.”

Elara found her voice, a dry rasp. “Is that an invitation or a threat?”

For the first time, she saw his mouth curve. It wasn’t a smile. It was a crack in the marble.
“It’s a lesson. The next name on the list is Claude Bisset. His soupe de poisson uses a fish stock made from frozen frames. The Gardener will correct him. Tomorrow night. Bisset’s restaurant, Les Algues. Be there. Watch. Understand the necessity.”

“Or what?”

“Or you will remain part of the problem. A bystander tasting the lies and saying nothing. That, to him, is a deeper sin.” He pushed off from the refrigerator. “Come alone. Your digital friend’s firewalls are… adequate. But his physical security is not. It would be a shame if his curiosity led to a culinary accident. A gas leak in his building is so common.”

The threat against Detective Marcus Reed was a cold knife in her ribs. It was specific. It was real.
Croft moved back toward the door, his silhouette once more blending with the dark. He paused, his hand on the knob. “Wear something dark. The kitchen light is very bright.”

He opened the door and was gone, melting into the darkness of the stairwell. The lock clicked shut, leaving only the sound of the listless rain and the frantic hammering of Elara’s heart against her ribs.
She didn’t move for a full minute, then two, the dust in her nostrils, the cold of the refrigerator numbing her shoulder. Slowly, she extracted herself. Her legs were weak. She walked to the door, checked the lock. It was intact. She leaned her forehead against the cool wood, breathing hard.
Her eyes went to the pinboard. In the gloom, the red string connecting to Liam Croft appeared to vibrate with a malevolent energy. He wasn’t a ghost. He was a zealot. And The Gardener wasn’t just a murderer; he was a curator, offering her a front-row seat to his exhibition of horrors.
She looked at her hands, trembling slightly. They were the hands of a cook, a detective, a woman who could deconstruct a sauce to its origins. Now they empty. She thought of Detective Marcus Reed, alone in his neon-lit room of servers, and of Claude Bisset, a man she’d never met, preparing a fraudulent fish soup somewhere across the city, utterly unaware that his final review was scheduled for tomorrow night.
The Gardener wasonlyjust pruning his garden. He was offering her the shears. The question, which coiled in her gut like a sickness, was whether watching him work would make her want to take them, or make her want to break them over her knee.
She strode to High-end, modernist restaurant kitchens island, where Croft had stood. On the marble, where his hand had rested, was a single, perfect, fresh bay leaf. It hadn’t been there before. It was a deep, glossy green, veins pronounced, its aromatic, camphor scent just beginning to seep into the air. A calling card. An ingredient.
She picked it up. It was cool and leathery between her fingers. She crushed it, and the scent exploded—pungent, medicinal, a warning and a promise all at once. She dropped it into her empty tea cup, where it lay like a dead, green tongue.
The cultivation had begun. And she was now, irrevocably, part of the garden.
