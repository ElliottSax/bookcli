Chapter 8: Live Service

The air in the incident room was thick with the smell of stale coffee and frantic energy. Screens glowed, casting a sickly pallor on the faces of the detectives. At the center of it all, on a large monitor, was a nightmare rendered in high definition.

Elara Vance stood before it, her body rigid, her mind a whirlpool of dread and analysis. The live stream was a study in cruel composition. The camera was fixed, high-angled, capturing a stark, stainless-steel kitchen island. A man, mid-fifties, his once-proud chef’s frame now slumped in terror, was tied to a chair at the island’s edge. His whites were pristine, a mocking costume. A single copper bowl, a whisk, a block of butter, and a lemon were arranged before him with ritualistic precision. In the background, the walls were a generic, glossy white, but the layout—the placement of a faux window with fake sunlight, the curve of the counter, the style of the overhead rack—it tickled a memory at the base of Elara’s skull.

“We’re tracing the IP, but it’s a maze of proxies,” a tech officer muttered, fingers flying over a keyboard. “He’s bouncing the signal through half the world.”

Detective Inspector Aris Thorne stood beside Elara, a solid, silent presence radiating controlled fury. “Can we get audio to him? A way to communicate?”

“The stream is one-way video, audio out only from his location,” the tech said. “But there’s a chat function. That’s how he’s communicating.”

As if summoned, text appeared in a stark white font over the lower third of the video feed.

TheGardener: Good evening, class. Our lesson tonight is on emulsion. The delicate marriage of oil and water, of effort and patience. It is a test of nerve.

The chef on screen, his face beaded with sweat under the hot studio lights, flinched as the text scrolled.

“It’s Chef Marco,” Elara said, her voice quiet but slicing through the static. “Marco Bellini. He had a show, ‘Bellini’s Basics,’ about fifteen years ago. It was… short-lived.”

The memory crystallized, a fragment of her own culinary school days where his failure was a cautionary tale whispered between students. “He was doing a live episode on mother sauces. The hollandaise broke, publicly, catastrophically. He threw the pan. It became a clip show staple. He never got another TV gig.”

On screen, more text appeared.

TheGardener: Chef Marco failed his first test. The sauce broke. His temper broke. The sacred bond of trust with his audience shattered. Tonight, he has one chance to reforge it. One perfect hollandaise. The recipe is in his mind. The tools are before him. The time is now.

A timer materialized in the top right corner of the stream: 45:00. It began to count down.

“He’s going to make him cook,” Thorne breathed, disgusted.

“He’s going to make him perform,” Elara corrected, a cold understanding settling in her gut. “Look at the kitchen. It’s not a real kitchen. It’s a replica. The set of ‘Bellini’s Basics.’ I recognize the tile pattern behind the fake window. The Gardener has recreated the scene of the crime.”

The horror of it was exquisite. The killer hadn’t just kidnapped a chef; he’d built a stage for his humiliation, a prison of his own past.

“We have to talk to him,” Thorne said. “If we can’t send audio, we type in the chat. We guide him.”

“He’ll see it,” Elara said, pointing to the chat log where The Gardener’s words glowed. “He’s monitoring it. He’ll interfere.”

A new idea sparked in the tech officer’s eyes. “The microphone on Marco’s end is sensitive. We can hear his breathing, the scrape of his chair. If we could get a comms unit to him, something tiny, we could speak. He could hear us through an earpiece.”

“How, for God’s sake?” Thorne snapped. “We don’t even know where here is!”

Elara wasn’t listening. She was studying the stream, her critic’s eye parsing details beyond the obvious terror. The light was flat and artificial, no natural gradient. No ambient sound of traffic or city life. An industrial space, then, or a soundproofed room. The replica set was built within a larger shell. She saw a sliver of darkness beyond the edge of the set’s false wall, a glimpse of concrete floor and a thick, black electrical cable snaking away.

“He’s local,” she murmured. “This set… it would take time, resources to build. It’s not something you pack up and move. It’s here, in the city. In a warehouse, a locked commercial unit.”

TheGardener: Your time begins now, Chef. The bonds are designed to allow movement of your arms. You may begin. Clarify your butter. Remember, the heat must be gentle. Respect the elements.

On screen, Marco Bellini stared at the tools, his hands trembling. He struggled against the ropes binding his wrists to the chair arms, but they gave enough slack for him to reach the equipment. With a shuddering breath, he reached for the block of butter, his fingers slipping on the wax paper.

“We’re cross-referencing commercial leases, storage units, anything that might fit,” a detective called from across the room. “But it’s a haystack.”

Elara leaned closer to the screen. Marco was cutting the butter into cubes, his movements clumsy with fear. He placed the copper bowl over a small saucepan of water—a bain-marie. The setup was rudimentary, the heat source hidden from view.

“He’s rushing,” Elara said. “The butter is in too-large cubes. They’ll melt unevenly. He’s terrified.”

TheGardener: Patience, Chef. You rush. You always rushed. To fame, to judgment, to anger. Slow hands make smooth sauce.

Marco jerked as if struck, knocking a cube of butter onto the floor. A sob hitched in his throat, amplified by the sensitive microphone. The sound was raw, human, utterly at odds with the sterile theatre of the set.

An officer rushed into the room, holding a small, plastic-wrapped device. “We have it. A subcutaneous comms unit. Voice-activated, receiver smaller than a pea. But we need to get it to him.”

Thorne’s jaw worked. “We have to find him before that timer hits zero. The Gardener doesn’t make empty threats.”

Elara watched Marco begin to clarify the butter, the milk solids beginning to foam and sputter. He was overheating it. The butter would brown, imparting a nutty flavor that was wrong for a classic hollandaise. It was a fundamental error, born of panic.

“I can talk him through it,” she said, turning to Thorne. Her voice held no boast, only a grim certainty. “But I need to observe every detail. The color of the butter foam, the consistency of the egg yolks when he whisks them. I need to be his eyes, his calm.”

Thorne held her gaze for a long moment, then gave a sharp nod. He turned to the tech. “Get that feed on every screen. Isolate the audio. Elara, you’re on. The moment we have a location, we move. Your job is to buy him time.”

The subcutaneous unit was a desperate gamble. The plan was brutal in its simplicity: when the tactical team breached, they would attempt to throw the device, contained in a soft, sticky gel pod, to Marco. He would have to get it to his ear. It was a thousand-to-one shot.

Elara pulled a chair directly before the main monitor, blocking out the chaos of the room. She focused on the image of Marco, on the small universe of the kitchen island. She became a director, a coach, a lifeline.

“Marco,” she whispered, though he couldn’t hear her yet. “Look at the butter. See the color.”

On screen, Marco strained the melted butter, leaving the milk solids behind. It was a passable job, but the liquid gold had a faint, amber tinge. He had let it go too far.

He then took two egg yolks, his hands shaking so violently he nearly dropped one. He placed them in a clean copper bowl. The whisk clattered against the side.

TheGardener: The whisk is your heartbeat, Chef. Steady. Rhythmic. Do not let it falter.

Elara’s mind raced ahead. The recipe was simple: yolks, a splash of water, lemon juice, whisked over gentle heat until pale and thickened, then the clarified butter incorporated drop by drop. Bu
