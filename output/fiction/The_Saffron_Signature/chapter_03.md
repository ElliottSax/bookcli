Chapter 3: The Ghost of Reviews Past

Under the vaulted, soot-stained glass roof of the Spice Bazaar, the air thickened into a visible haze. Sharp bars of morning light cut through the gloom, swirling dust motes thick as pollen. Cumin, sharp and earthy, mixed with the aniseed bite of star anise and the smoky, red warmth of paprika that caught in the back of the throat. Beneath it all, threading through like a gold wire, was the hay-like, metallic perfume of true saffron—the smell of other places, of dry hills and packed earth, an atmosphere breathed by generations. Moving through the narrow aisles in her charcoal coat, Elara absorbed the dim light. This sensory assault offered a welcome distraction, a puzzle of provenance and price to momentarily override the one of motive and murder.
Her own ghost lingered here. Its presence echoed in the glances of the older vendors, the slight pause in their haggling as she passed. *The critic. The one who could, with a paragraph, turn a shipment into gold or leave it rotting in burlap.* She kept her eyes forward, her worn boot soles silent on the stone floor.
In his customary niche, a cave of burlap sacks and gleaming copper scales, Aris Thorne seemed carved from olive wood and patience. Dark, veined hands moved with an economy that spoke of fifty years weighing the world in grams. Eyes the colour of strong tea held to the light watched the balance arm of his scale as if it were telling a story. He didn’t look up from the mound of crimson sumac, a pile of crushed sunset, as she approached his counter.
Sounds of the bazaar—the murmur of Turkish, the clink of weights, the rustle of paper cones—receded. She waited. Only after tapping the last of the sumac from the scoop did his gaze lift.
“Mr. Thorne.”

His hands stilled on the brass weights. Not a flinch, but a cessation. He knew her voice. Three years had passed since she’d stood in this same spot, the air then thick with the peppery promise of black Malabar berries he’d let her crush between her fingers. That article had been a small thing, a sidebar in a weekend supplement on artisanal suppliers. She’d written that his peppercorns held a “clean, volcanic heat that spoke of a single hillside, not a warehouse.” For him, whose name was his only advertisement, it had meant a six-month waiting list. For her, it had been a rare moment of reporting on creation, not destruction.
“Miss Vance.” His voice rustled, dry as burlap sliding over stone. He set the weights down with a soft click. “I heard you were… consulting.” The pause was deliberate. The word ‘consulting’ hung in the spicy air, too clean, too corporate for what everyone knew she did: picking through the wreckage of her own career with the police.
“The hearing is sharp as ever, Aris.” A thin smile failed to reach her eyes. “I need your eyes now. Not for a feature.”

From her inner coat pocket, she extracted a folded piece of paper, the leather of her notebook warm from her body. She placed it on the worn cedar counter, next to the vibrant pile of sumac. Stark contrast emerged: the vivid, organic red against the sterile white of the copy paper with its smudged, grey lines. A composite sketch, vague and frustrating, born from the shaky, fear-glazed memory of a delivery driver who’d seen a man lurking near the service entrance of the second victim’s restaurant the night before the murder. Average height, average build, maybe a chef’s coat under a dark jacket, face a blur.
Thorne wiped his hands on a cloth mapped with a hundred different spices. He didn’t immediately pick up the paper. First, his tea-coloured eyes held hers for a beat too long, as if weighing her desperation. Then, with a slight sigh that appeared to come from the shelves themselves, he unfolded it.
He studied the sketch not for seconds, but for a full minute. His expression didn’t change. Angling the paper slightly toward the light from a hanging bulb, he finally lifted his gaze, not to her, but past her shoulder at a specific high shelf in the shadows of his niche—a row of unmarked glass jars with handwritten labels in a script she couldn’t read.
“He was here,” Thorne said, the words quiet but absolute. “Four days ago. Not a chef.”

Elara’s breath caught, a tiny, audible hitch. “How can you be sure?” She leaned forward, palms flat on the cool wood.
Thorne finally looked at her. “A chef,” he said, his voice gaining a subtle, tutorial cadence, “when he comes to me, his hands are already talking. They hover. They pinch a coriander seed to feel its dryness, they rub a clove between thumb and forefinger to release its oil. It is a conversation. Even the arrogant ones, the ones who think they know everything, their touch is… proprietary. They claim the flavour with their skin.” He tapped the paper with a gnarled finger. “This man touched my spices like a librarian handling a Gutenberg bible. White cotton gloves. Precise. Reverent, yes, but… detached. He looked at the jar, not the spice inside. The eyes in your drawing are wrong. They show nothing. The man who came here had no passion in his gaze. Only purpose. A cold, clean purpose.”

A sudden, sharp rhythm beat in Elara’s throat, a second pulse beneath her skin. The librarian analogy chilled with its precision. This wasn’t a crime of heat, but one of cold, clinical research. “What did he buy?”

Without a word, Thorne turned and selected a step-stool from the corner. His joints protested with a soft pop as he climbed. From the high shelf, he took a plain glass jar, its contents a muted, dusty green. Unscrewing the lid as he descended, he brought it to the counter, and an aroma bloomed between them.
It was not one of the grand, dramatic spices. Soft, green, melancholic, it smelled of sun-drenched meadows at the very end of summer, of the crushed leaves in a childhood pocket, of a faint, clean citrus that was more memory than taste. *Melissa officinalis*. Lemon balm.
“He bought one hundred grams of dried lemon balm,” Thorne replied, his brow furrowing. “A specific batch, from a small, biodynamic farm near Forcalquier, in Provence. The soil there is very particular. The flavour is… quieter. More complex. I only get a kilo a year.” He replaced the lid, sealing the scent of nostalgic calm. “And he asked for wildflower honey. Not just any. From the Hampstead Heath apiaries. The autumn harvest.”

Elara’s mind raced. “Autumn? That’s…”

“Darker,” Thorne finished. “More complex. The bees have fewer flowers. It’s a more desperate, concentrated sweetness. Thicker. It tastes of ivy and late-blooming heather and decay.” He met her eyes. “He specified it. He knew the difference.”

A cold finger, sharp as an icicle, traced the length of her spine. Lemon balm. A calming herb, a gentle nervine, steeped for tisanes to soothe anxiety, to quiet a racing heart. And the honey… not just honey, but a specific, sombre harvest from a specific place. The connections clicked into place with an almost physical sound. Detective Marcus Reed’s list, now a living document of shame in her mind. The next name, the most likely candidate based on the escalating pattern of public humiliation, was Leo Margolis.
Leo Margolis. His celebrated Mayfair patisserie, L’Éclat, had been a temple of delicate, architectural desserts. His downfall had not been a failed soufflé or a sour sorbet. It had been a live, televised interview on a morning talk show, a fluffy piece meant to be about the art of sugar. The host, a woman with a relentlessly sunny disposition, had asked about his inspiration. He’d mentioned his childhood in the South of France, his grandmother’s orchard. And then she’d asked, with a giggle, “Were you a little boy who loved stealing honey from the bees?”

The change had been instantaneous and terrible. Margolis’s affable mask had dissolved. His face had drained of colour, his hands had begun to shake, rattling the fine porcelain cup on its saucer. He’d tried to deflect, to laugh it off, but the host, smelling ratings, had pressed. “Oh, come now, Leo! A big, brave chef scared of a little bee?” The camera had zoomed in. A single tear had tracked through the meticulous stubble on his cheek. Then another. He’d broken, his voice cracking as he described a traumatic, swollen sting at age five, the feeling of his throat closing, the panic that had never left him. He’d wept, openly, helplessly, on national television, a man reduced to a terrified child. L’Éclat had closed within six months. The signature dessert he’d been promoting that day was a delicate, honey-glazed mille-feuille called “Sunlit Swarm.”

The killer wasn’t simply using ingredients. He was writing a recipe of torment. Lemon balm to calm a fear he was about to exploit. Autumn honey, the extremely symbol of the bee’s labour, dark and heavy with the season of death.
“He’s targeting Leo Margolis,” Elara said, her voice hollow in her own ears.
“The pastry chef who is afraid of bees,” Thorne stated. It wasn’t a question. The scandal had been culinary gossip for months.
“Did he say anything else? Anything at all?”

Thorne was silent, his eyes clouded with the effort of recall. He glanced down at his hands, at the stains of turmeric and sumac ground into the whorls of his fingerprints. “He paid in cash. New notes. They felt… stiff. And when I handed him the bag, our fingers did not touch. He was careful of that. But he did ask one more thing.” Thorne’s gaze lifted, sharpening. “He asked if the honey crystallised quickly. A strange question. I told him the autumn harvest tends to be more stable, but that all raw honey will crystallise in time. It is a sign of quality.”

“What did he say?”

“answeredaid, ‘Good. Crystals have a better structure.’” Thorne shook his head slowly. “I thought he meant for presentation. For a dessert. But his voice… it was not a chef’s voice thinking of presentation.”

Elara’s mind snagged on the phrase. Crystals have a better structure. It was cold, analytical. Architectural. She thought of the first victim, Chef Bolton, forced to consume the raw, bleeding meat. A structure of protein and fear. The second, Madame Chiang, with the suffocating cloud of ghost pepper—a structure of air and agony. This was different. This was about infusion, preservation, a slow, sweet poisoning of the soul.
“You have to warn him,” Thorne said, his usual impassivity fractured by a line of urgency.
“I will. Thank you, Aris. This is… more than I hoped for.”

He nodded, already turning back to his scales, a man retreating into the world he understood. But as she folded the useless sketch and turned to go, his voice stopped her, softer now.
“Miss Vance.”

She looked back.
“The man who came here,” murmuredne said, choosing his words with the same care he chose his saffron. “He smelled of nothing. In a place that is all smell, he carried no scent of kitchen, of smoke, of soap, of sweat. He was a blank page. That is not natural.”

A blank page. Waiting for a story to be written on it. Or to write one himself, in other people’s terror.
Elara fled the Spice Bazaar, the comforting, familiar cacophony of smells now feeling cloying, oppressive. Bursting out onto the damp pavement, the cold London air was a slap, scoured clean of history and intent. She fumbled for her phone, her fingers numb. She called Detective Marcus Reed. It went to voicemail. She called again. On the third ring, he answered, his voice muffled, tense.
“Vance. I’m in a briefing.”

“Leo Margolis. The killer is targeting Leo Margolis next. He bought lemon balm and specific wildflower honey from the Hampstead Heath autumn harvest. He’s constructing something around the bee phobia. You need to get to Margolis, put him under protection, now.”

A beat of silence. She could hear the rustle of paper, a low murmur in the background. “How do you know this?”

“Aris Thorne at the Spice Bazaar. The man was there, four days ago. Detective Marcus Reed, he’s not a chef. Thorne said he had no passion. Only purpose.”

“Thorne’s credible?”

“He’s the most credible man in this city when it comes to what people truly seek. You need to move.”

“We’re stretched, Elara. We have uniforms doing drive-bys on all the names on that list. Margolis is on it. But I can’t put a full-time detail on every chef with a bad Yelp review.”

“This isn’t a bad Yelp review!” she hissed, turning her back to the stream of pedestrians. “This is a man who buys ingredients like a chemist preparing a lab experiment. He asked about the crystalline structure of honey. Does that sound like a gourmet to you?”

Another pause, longer this time. She heard him exhale, a weary sound. “Alright. I’ll try to divert a car. Where are you?”

“Heading to Mayfair.” The decision forwhisperedas she said it.
“Elara, no. Do not approach him. You’ll spook him, or worse, you might lead the killer right to him if you’re being followed.”

“He won’t talk to a police car. He’s a broken man living in the ruins of his reputation. He’ll see a critic before he sees a uniform. I might be the only person he’ll open the door for.” The irony was bitter on her tongue.
“It’s a terrible idea.”

“It’s the only idea we have right now. Just get someone there. I’m going to try to get him to listen.” She hung up before he could argue further.
The journey to Mayfair was a blur of jarring Tube stops and her own frantic thoughts. A blank page. The killer was an eraser first, wiping away the identity of a chef, then a writer, inscribing a new, horrific narrative over the top. She thought of her own reviews, their surgical precision. Had they been a kind of erasure too? Stripping away the context, the effort, leaving only the flaw? A cold nausea settled in her stomach.
She found the address, a once-elegant Georgian townhouse now showing the subtle scars of neglect: peeling black paint on a window frame, a missing brick in the front steps. The plaque that had once read L’Éclat was gone, but its ghost remained, a faint, cleaner rectangle in the soot-stained stone. The ground floor windows were dark, blinds drawn tight.
She rang the bell. No answer. She could feel the emptiness emanating from the other side of the door. She rang again, holding it longer. From within, a faint, shuffling sound. A shadow moved against the thin light at the edge of a blind.
“Who is it?” The voice was thin, reedy, stripped of the confident, French-accented baritone she remembered from his TV appearances.
“Leo? It’s Elara Vance.” She used her full name, her professional name, the only currency she had left.
Silence. Then the sound of multiple locks disengaging, chains rattling. The door opened a crack, held by a security chain. One eye, bloodshot and swimming with suspicion, peered out. Leo Margolis was a ghost of his former self. His handsome face was gaunt, stubble peppered with grey he’d never allowed before. He wore a stained dressing gown over a crumpled shirt.
“Elara Vance?” he whispered, as if the name itself was a relic from a lost civilisation. “What… what do you want?” There was no anger, only a profound, weary confusion. He did not seem to remember that she had never reviewed his restaurant, that she had no direct hand in his fall.
“Leo, I need to talk to you. It’s urgent. It’s about your safety.”

A dry, humourless sound escaped him. It might have been a laugh. “My safety? From what? The last of my creditors? The last journalist who hasn’t had a laugh yet?”

“From the man who killed Geoffrey Bolton and Madame Chiang.”

All the remaining colour drained from his face. The eye blinked, slow and reptilian. The door closed. For a heart-stopping moment, she thought he’d shut her out. Then she heard the chain slide free. The door opened fully.
The interior was a tomb. The air was cold and still, thick with the smell of dust, stale coffee, and beneath it, the faint, sweet-sour scent of old, forgotten sugar. The beautiful patisserie cases were empty, their glass smeared. A single worktable stood in the middle of the room, covered not in pastry bags and chocolate temperers, but in unopened mail, empty bottles of inexpensive wine, and ashtrays overflowing with cigarette butts.
He shuffled ahead of her, not offering to take her coat, and collapsed onto a stool by the table. He lit a cigarette with trembling hands. “Say what you have come to say.”

She remained standing, feeling like an intruder in this museum of failure. “There is a man. He’s targeting chefs who… who had very public downfalls.” She chose the words carefully, avoiding ‘shame,’ ‘humiliation.’ “He uses ingredients that are… personal. To the chef’s failure. He was asking about you. He bought lemon
