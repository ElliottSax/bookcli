Chapter 3: The Ghost of Reviews Past

Under the vaulted, soot-stained glass roof of the Spice Bazaar, the air was a visible tapestry of dust motes dancing in slanting morning light, thick with the ghosts of a thousand caravans. Cumin, star anise, smoked paprika, and the dizzying, hay-like perfume of true saffron wove a tapestry so potent it felt like breathing history. A ghost herself in her charcoal coat, Elara moved through the aisles, senses assaulted, her mind trying to parse the culinary from the criminal.

In his customary niche, a cave of burlap sacks and gleaming copper scales, Aris Thorne was a man carved from olive wood and patience, his eyes the colour of strong tea. He didn’t look up from weighing a mound of crimson sumac as she approached.

“Mr. Thorne.”

His hands stilled. He knew her voice. Years ago, she had written a piece on artisanal suppliers, praising his Malabar peppercorns as “the only ones in the city worth the name.” It was a rare kindness in her archive.

“Miss Vance.” His voice was a dry rustle. “I heard you were… consulting.”

“Aris, I need your eyes.” She placed a folded piece of paper on the counter, next to the sumac. It was a composite sketch, vague and frustrating, based on the shaky memory of a delivery driver near the second victim’s restaurant: a man, average, perhaps wearing a chef’s coat under a dark jacket, nothing distinctive.

Wiping his hands on a cloth, Thorne unfolded the paper. He studied it for a long moment, his gaze distant. Turning, he looked at a specific shelf, a row of unmarked jars. “He was here. Four days ago. Not a chef.”

“How can you be sure?”

“A chef touches spices like a lover. This man touched them like a librarian handling a rare manuscript. Precise. Reverent, but… detached.” A gnarled finger pointed at the sketch. “The eyes are wrong. The man who came here had no passion. Only purpose.”

A sudden, sharp rhythm began to beat in Elara’s throat. “What did he buy?”

Moving to the shelf, Thorne unscrewed a jar. The aroma that bloomed was not one of the grand, dramatic spices. Soft and melancholic, it carried the scent of sun-drenched meadows and childhood. *Melissa officinalis*. Lemon balm.

“He bought dried lemon balm. A specific batch, from a small farm in Provence. I only get a kilo a year.” Thorne’s brow furrowed. “And he asked for wildflower honey from the Hampstead Heath apiaries. Not the commercial stuff. The autumn harvest, which is… darker. More complex.”

A cold finger traced the length of her spine. Lemon balm. A calming herb, often used in tisanes for anxiety. And the honey… She knew. According to Reed’s list of chefs with public, shameful failures, the next likely victim was Leo Margolis. His celebrated Mayfair patisserie had collapsed after a disastrous interview where he’d been forced to admit a severe, childhood-onset phobia of bees. He’d broken down weeping on national television, describing a traumatic sting. His signature dessert, a
