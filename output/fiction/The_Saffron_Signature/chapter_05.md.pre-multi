Chapter 5: The Gardener's Cultivation

The rain on Elara’s window wasn’t falling; it was being smeared across the glass by a listless wind, turning the Parisian night into a watercolour of bruised purples and sickly sodium-yellow. Inside her apartment, the air was thick with the ghosts of meals past—the faint, greasy memory of last night’s seared duck breast, the astringent ghost of lemon zest from a week ago, the ever-present, comforting scent of her wooden cutting board, worn smooth in the centre like a river stone.

She stood before her pinboard, a tapestry of culinary shame. Photographs of the two crime scenes—the risotto, the tarte Tatin—were flanked by her own notes, sharp and accusing in black ink. In the centre was the list from the guild, the three remaining names under the heading ‘Pour la Purification.’ And to the side, connected by a web of red string, was the new, chilling node of her investigation: ‘L’Académie de la Pureté.’

The school had existed for only eighteen months, five years ago, in a repurposed convent. Its headmaster, a man known only as Le Jardinier—The Gardener—had promised not just technical excellence, but culinary transcendence. He preached a doctrine of brutal purity. Flavour was a moral imperative; imperfection, a sin. Reed’s digital digging had unearthed fragments: hushed forum posts from culinary students, a single investigative article that was pulled within hours of publication, a police report with most lines redacted into oblivion. The report’s conclusion was stark: closed following the suicide of a student, one Hugo Lefevre, who had jumped from the school’s clock tower after being forced to eat his own, “insipid” consommé in front of his peers for three consecutive nights.

Elara’s fingers traced the red string to a photograph of the first victim, Alain Genet. A society caterer, known for his flawless, if soulless, canapés. Buried in the financial records Reed had exhumed was a transaction, a “consultancy fee” paid from Genet’s company to a shell corporation. That corporation, through a labyrinthine trail, led back to the headmaster of the Académie. The Gardener had been paid. For what? Silence? A curriculum? A stamp of approval Genet could never earn in a real kitchen?

“He’s pruning them,” Elara whispered to the rain-streaked window. “The guild list is his garden. And these… these are the weeds.”

Her phone buzzed, shattering the silence. Reed’s name glowed on the screen.

“Elara. We have a name. A student from the Académie. Top of his class, by all accounts. Vanished the day after the school was shuttered.” Reed’s voice was tight, a wire about to snap. “Liam Croft.”

The name landed in the quiet room with a physical weight. “British?”

“Half. Mother French, father a London financier. A prodigy. Enrolled at sixteen. Witness statements from the investigation—what few we have—describe him as The Gardener’s favourite, his ‘most promising shoot.’ After Lefevre’s suicide, Crof
