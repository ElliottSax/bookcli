Chapter 2: A Bitter Aftertaste

Rain hissed, soft and persistent, against the windows of the 12th Precinct, doing nothing to wash away the smell of stale coffee, industrial cleaner, and low-grade anxiety. Tracing the grain of the scarred oak bench with her fingers, Elara Vance sat in her simple black chef’s trousers and jacket—a uniform of grease and fire—absurdly out of place against the muted blues and grays of law enforcement.

From a room away, the muffled rise and fall of her brother Liam’s voice, punctuated by Captain Moretti’s deeper, gruffer tones, formed a clear cadence: persuasion meeting entrenched resistance.

Elara closed her eyes. The Gala’s kitchen during the moment just before the collapse returned—a visual symphony. Kaito Tanaka’s hands moved over his molecular gastronomy set-up with surgical precision, droplets of liquid nitrogen smoking like dragon’s breath on the stainless steel. Against the hellfire of the stove, Alain Desmarais stood as a bullish silhouette, his face a mask of grim concentration while reducing a red wine sauce; the air thickened with the scent of reduced shallots, black pepper, and expensive Burgundy. Whispering a silent ode to earth and moss, Simone Thorne arranged her foraged morels on a porcelain slate with a touch so tender it seemed she was putting children to bed.

And Anton Voltaire. At his table, a king holding court. His fork broke the crust of the soufflé. An almost obscene puff of steam carried the scent of dark chocolate, orange zest, and something else… something elusive. His eyes closed in theatrical bliss. Then came the spasm. The terrible, wet choke. A vacuum of silence, sucking all other sound into it.

“Elara Vance.”

She started. Liam stood before her, his face pale with fatigue but his eyes alight with a hard-won victory, smelling of rain and cold pavement.

“He agreed. Conditionally. You’re a ‘consultant.’ My consultant. You don’t touch anything unless I say. You don’t go anywhere unless I’m with you. And for God’s sake, don’t mention the… the palate thing as a superpower. Moretti thinks you’re a food scene insider who can read context.”

“I am a food scene insider,” Elara said, standing on stiff joints. “I just read it with my tongue.”

“Elara.”

“Fine. What’s the catch?”

“The catch is he thinks it’s a waste of time. One sneeze on a piece of evidence, and he’ll have my badge and your food truck’s license.”

“Motivation enough,” she said dryly.

Their drive to the shuttered Gilded Phoenix passed in quiet. Usually a beacon of light and opulence, the grand building now stood as a dark hulk, cordoned off by yellow tape glowing sickly under the streetlights. Rain made rivers of the gilt on the signage.

Inside, a profound and wrong silence reigned. Kitchens were never silent; they hummed with refrigeration, clicked with cooling metal, dripped with residual life. This silence was dead. Crime scene techs had left behind a ghostly landscape of numbered markers and faint powdery residues. Once thick with a hundred delicious layers, the air now sat flat and cold, carrying only the ghost of bleach and a metallic tang of blood.

At the center stood the kitchen island, a vast expanse of Italian marble. Upon it, under a clear evidence tent, sat the remains of Anton Voltaire’s last meal: the Phoenix Egg soufflé. A collapsed, tragic ruin. Its glorious, airy crown had deflated into a sad, brownish crater beside a single, pristine fork, tagged and bagged.

Liam handed her a pair of latex gloves. “The scene’s been processed. You can get closer. Just… do your thing.”

Approaching slowly, her chef’s clogs echoed on the tile. She didn’t look at the dish first, but at the space around it. Her eyes closed, she breathed in.

“What are you getting?” Liam asked, notebook out.

“Not getting. Remembering,” she murmured. “From last night. The base notes are gone. But the high notes… they linger in the memory of the air. Butter. Good butter, French, with a high fat content. It has a grassy, almost nutty sweetness. The chocolate was Valrhona Guanaja, 70%. It has a sharp, almost red fruit acidity beneath the roast. The orange zest wasn’t just zest; it was candied, then finely minced, so it carried a caramelized sugar note, a bitterness from the pith, and the oil from the peel. They used a touch of Grand Marnier in the base. The alcohol’s gone, but the essence of bitter orange and oak remains.”

Opening her eyes, she finally looked at the soufflé corpse. “They separated the eggs perfectly. Not a speck of yolk in the whites. The whites were whipped with cream of tartar—I can’t taste that, but I can see the structure in the collapse. It’s even, not granular. He was a bastard, but he was a brilliant bastard.”

“Focus on the ‘bastard’ part,” Liam said, pulling a small file from his jacket. “Our victim had hobbies beyond destroying careers in print. A blackmailer. A connoisseur of secrets.”

On a clean part of the counter, he laid out three photographs: Alain Desmarais, Kaito Tanaka, Simone Thorne. Their faces, captured in happier times, now looked like mugshots.

“Alain Desmarais,” Liam began. “His first two Michelin stars? The ‘signature’ dishes that put him on the map? Lifted, line for line, technique for technique, from the notebooks of his mentor, Jacques Bisset, who died of a stroke before publishing his own cookbook. Bisset’s widow has the originals. Anton Voltaire had copies. He was threatening to send them to the Michelin guide and Le Monde.”

A chill crept through Elara. Alain Desmarais’s entire empire, his bluster and pride, built on a foundation of stolen love. She pictured the notebooks, spidery handwriting in faded ink, splattered with reductions and hope. Stolen.

“Kaito Tanaka,” Liam continued. “The avant-garde wizard. His ‘essence of mountain fog,’ his ‘deconstructed sea breeze’? Not entirely foraged or distilled. He was using a lab in Rotterdam that synthesizes flavor compounds banned in the EU for consumption—industrial grade stuff, designed for scent, not taste. A shortcut. Anton Voltaire had the shipping manifests and a sample analysis.”

The pristine, scientific beauty of Kaito Tanaka’s food, a lie. A chemical trick. It made his sterile station seem suddenly sinister.

“And Simone Thorne.” Liam’s voice softened slightly. “Five years ago, a rival forager, a man named Silas, was hospitalized after eating death cap mushrooms he claimed were in his ‘personal stash.’ Simone Thorne was the last person seen arguing with him over a prized morel patch. Silas survived but has permanent liver damage. The investigation went nowhere for lack of evidence. Anton Voltaire had a witness—a homeless man who camped in those woods—who saw Simone Thorne near Silas’s basket.”

Elara Vance saw Simone Thorne’s gentle hands again, arranging the moss. Were they capable of arranging a man’s death? In the cutthroat world of rare ingredients, where a single patch of morels could be worth thousands, she knew the answer was yes.

“Motive, then. For all three,” Elara Vance said, her voice hollow.

“Compelling motive,” Liam agreed. “But here’s the rub. They all have an alibi. Each other. The final preparation of the soufflé—the mixing of the base, the whipping of the whites, the folding, the baking, the presentation—was a synchronized dance. They were all in this kitchen, in plain sight of each other and the staff, for the entire forty minutes leading to service. No one left. No one approached the dish alone.”

“A collective alibi,” Elara Vance mused, staring at their faces. “Or a collective crime.”


The precinct’s fluorescent lights buzzed like a hive of angry wasps. Elara Vance’s fingers stilled on the bench’s grain, her nails digging into the wood. Across the room, a uniformed officer coughed into his sleeve, the sound sharp and wet. The scent of antiseptic stung her nose, clashing with the lingering coffee fumes.

“You’re not eating.”

She didn’t turn at the voice. Liam’s shadow fell across the bench, long and angular. His hand hovered near her shoulder before retreating.

“Not hungry,” she lied.

The bench creaked as he sat, too close. His knee brushed hers, a fleeting contact that sent a jolt through her. She shifted away.

“You always ate when you were stressed,” he said, quiet. “Remember? Mom’s chocolate cake. You’d inhale it.”

Elara Vance’s throat tightened. The memory of her mother’s kitchen—warm, buttery, safe—flashed behind her eyes. Then the taste of it, bitter and wrong, twisted in her stomach.

“That was before,” she said. “Before I knew.”

Liam exhaled, slow. “Elara Vance—”

“Don’t.” Her voice was steel. “Not here.”

The fluorescent lights flickered, casting his face in streaks of shadow. For a heartbeat, he looked like a stranger. Then the lights steadied, and he was just her brother again. Just Liam.

She stood, her chair scraping. “I need air.”

The rain outside smelled like wet pavement and regret.

“My captain’s theory is an outsider. A disgruntled waiter, a scorned lover from Anton Voltaire’s past. But the poison had to be in the soufflé. And only these three had the access and skill to incorporate it seamlessly into something so delicate.”

Elara Vance turned back to the evidence tent. “The poison. What was it?”

“Lab’s backed up. Initial sweep showed traces of a ton of things in here—cleaning agents, pesticides on the foraged goods, allergens. Nothing definitive. That’s where you come in.”

She nodded, a tight, nervous motion. This was the line. On one side, Elara Vance, food truck chef. On the other, the thing she tried to keep caged. She lifted the tent flap. The smell intensified, concentrated. Death had a taste, even before it killed; a metallic, static note that sat on the tongue. Beneath it was the ghost of the chocolate, now souring, and the stale, sulfurous smell of overcooked egg.

“I need to taste the air inside,” she said.

Liam looked pained but nodded.

She leaned down, close to the collapsed center. She opened her mouth slightly and inhaled, drawing the air over her tongue. It was a technique, like tasting wine. Letting the volatiles hit the olfactory receptors through the back of the palate.

First, the expected: the fading, rich chocolate, the oxidized citrus, the caramelized milk solids from the browning. Then the unwelcome: the faint, acrid sting of vomit, the iron of blood. And then… the substrate. The canvas upon which the poison was painted. The soufflé itself. Perfect. Flawless.

“The dish is clean,” she said, straightening up. “I mean, the preparation was clean. No off-notes. No bitterness from over-whipped egg, no graininess from undissolved sugar. The poison… it didn’t alter the base flavor profile. It was a guest that didn’t argue with the host.”

“Meaning?”

“Meaning it was either utterly flavorless, or it was designed to complement the dish. To belong there.”

Her eyes scanned the debris. A few crumbs had scattered outside the main collapse. She pointed to a tiny, dark brown speck on the marble, a foot from the plate. “That. May I?”

Liam used a gloved hand and a plastic spatula to lift the crumb onto a sterile swab. He handed it to her. She took it, removed her glove, and placed the minuscule fragment on her tongue.

It dissolved instantly. It was just soufflé. Chocolate, egg, sugar. But then, as it vanished, a phantom note emerged. Not a taste, but a memory of a taste. A cooling sensation, followed by a faint, floral bitterness that vanished almost before it registered. Like the echo of a bell.

Her blood turned to ice.

It was familiar. Terribly, intimately familiar.

It was the flavor of Starfall Lily.

A memory, sharp as a knife, sliced through her. Not this kitchen. Another kitchen. A smaller, warmer one, filled with the smell of her mother’s boeuf bourguignon. A younger Elara Vance, maybe twelve, peering into a mortar where her mother was grinding dried, silvery-purple petals with a pestle. “For special occasions, ma chérie,” her mother had said, her voice a soft melody. “A secret from the old country. A pinch makes the flavors sing. Too much…” She’d made a face. “Too much, and the song becomes a scream. It is banned now. Too dangerous. We keep this one for us.”

Years later, at culinary school, she’d seen the name in a forbidden textbook on toxic gastronomy: Galenia stellara. Starfall Lily. A neurotoxin. Symptoms: euphoria, then paralysis of the diaphragm, asphyxiation. Flavor profile: faintly floral, with a distinctive cooling effect, followed by a bitter aftertaste. Used in medieval times to eliminate rivals, as it was thought to mimic a heart seizure. Banned worldwide since 1953.

Her mother’s secret. Their secret.

How did it get here?

“Elara Vance?” Liam’s voice was sharp. “You’re white as a sheet. What is it?”

She forced herself to swallow, though her mouth was dust-dry. “I… I need to check something. The foraged ingredients. Simone Thorne’s station.”

Simone Thorne’s area was a world apart. Drying racks held delicate fungi. Baskets contained lichens and roots. Jars held infused oils and powders. It smelled of damp soil, pine, and the sweet decay of autumn.

Elara Vance’s heart hammered against her ribs. She scanned the jars, her eyes frantically seeking the tell-tale silvery-purple. It wasn’t there. Of course it wasn’t. It would be insane to have it out in the open.

But Anton Voltaire knew secrets. He knew about Alain Desmarais’s theft, Kaito Tanaka’s chemicals, Simone Thorne’s poisoning. What if he had dug deeper? What if he had discovered the secret of the Starfall Lily? Not just what it was, but who had once used it?

Her mother, Colette Vance, had been a promising chef before her dreams were swallowed by early motherhood and a struggling restaurant. She’d taken her secrets to the grave, years ago. Could Anton Voltaire have connected her to it? Could he have been blackmailing someone… with a secret from Elara Vance’s own past?

“Find anything?” Liam was beside her.

“No,” she whispered. “It’s all… clean.”

It was a lie. The air in her lungs felt poisoned. She had come here to read the crime scene, but the crime scene had read her back. It had whispered a name from her childhood, a name wrapped in love and lullabies and lethal botany.

The hook was no longer about who killed Anton Voltaire. It was about why his death tasted of her mother’s secret. And which of the three chefs in this kitchen of lies and ambition had been desperate enough—or knowledgeable enough—to use a ghost from Elara Vance’s own life as their weapon.
