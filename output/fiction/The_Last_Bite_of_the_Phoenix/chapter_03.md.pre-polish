Chapter 3: The First Suspect: Stone and Fire

The rain had settled into a persistent, whispering drizzle by the time Elara stood before La Citadelle. Alain’s restaurant wasn’t just a building; it was a statement carved in limestone and restraint. It occupied a corner in the old quarter, its façade devoid of flashy signage. Only a discreet, polished brass plaque bore its name. The windows were high, narrow, and frosted, offering no glimpse of the life within. It was a fortress of gastronomy, and Elara felt the weight of its silence as she pushed the heavy oak door.

The air inside was a shock of contrast: bone-dry, warm, and scented with a profound, clean perfume of reduced stocks, roasting bones, and clarified butter. It was the smell of order, of centuries of technique refined to an exact science. The dining room was empty, chairs upturned on tables like silent soldiers at rest. A single, low-wattage bulb illuminated the pass, gleaming off stainless steel.

“You are early.”

Alain emerged from the shadows of the kitchen, a figure carved from the same stone as his restaurant. He was in his late fifties, his tall frame sheathed in a pristine, double-breasted chef’s jacket, its buttons straining slightly over a chest that spoke of a lifetime standing over heat. His hair, steel-grey and ruthlessly short, framed a face of severe angles—a prominent nose, a slashed mouth, eyes the colour of cold slate. He did not offer a hand.

“Inspector Laurent said you were expecting me,” Elara said, her voice sounding too loud in the sacred hush.

“Expecting. Not welcoming.” Alain’s gaze swept over her, taking in her practical jacket, her sensible boots, the notebook clutched in her hand. “A food truck chef. A palate he trusts, he says. Incroyable. The world is truly upside down. Come. We will not talk in the tomb.”

He turned, his movements economical, and led her through the swinging doors into the heart of La Citadelle.

The kitchen was a temple to classicism. Copper pots, their bottoms mirror-bright, hung in descending order of size. Knives rested in a slotted block, handles perfectly aligned. The marble work surfaces were bare, scrubbed to a ghostly whiteness. There was no clutter, no splash of colour, no radio chattering in the corner. Only the low, respectful hum of refrigeration and the faint, ticking hiss of a gas pilot light. It was a space where chaos was not just forbidden, but unimaginable.

“You understand why I agreed to this… intrusion?” Alain began, stopping before a vast, dormant range. “Voltaire is dead. Poisoned, they say, at my competitor’s table. But the shadow falls on all of us. My reputation is my life. This place,” he gestured with a blunt-fingered hand, “is my life. I will not have it smeared by suspicion.”

“The inspector believes you have a motive,” Elara said carefully, her eyes tracing the lines of the kitchen. “Voltaire was blackmailing you.”

A muscle in Alain’s jaw twitched. “Blackmail is a vulgar word. He possessed… information. He threatened to make it public.”

“Which was?”

Alain turned to face her fully, his stance defensive. “That I am a guardian. A purist. In a world chasing novelty like dogs after scraps, I hold the line. The Phoenix Egg recipe published in L’Éclat in 1973 by Chef Auguste Valère is the only true scripture. Deviation is not innovation; it is sacrilege. Voltaire knew I had… acquired Valère’s original annotated notes. He claimed I ‘stole’ them from the estate. He called it theft. I call it preservation. Without me, those notes would be dust in an attic, or worse, misinterpreted by fools like Simone.”

His voice was heated, but it was the heat of a forge—contained, directed, metallic. “My crime, in Voltaire’s eyes, was protecting tradition from the barbarians. He said he would reveal my ‘pilfering,’ make me look like a common thief instead of a disciple. The irony is, he was the vandal. He would have destroyed the very thing he claimed to critique.”

Elara listened, but her senses were elsewhere. She inhaled deeply, parsing the kitchen’s scent-profile. The dominant notes were clear: the deep, umami-rich scent of fond de veau, the sweet, subtle perfume of shallots sweating in butter, the clean, sharp tang of Chardonnay vinegar. It was a perfect, closed loop of classic French aromatics. No outliers.

“I need to taste it,” she said abruptly.

Alain stared at her. “Taste what?”

“Your Phoenix Egg. The one you would have served, had the Gala proceeded as planned.”

He scoffed. “It is eleven in the morning.”

“And a man is dead. The dish is the scene of the crime, Chef.”

For a long moment, he seemed poised to refuse. Then, with a curt nod, it began. He moved not with the frantic energy of a short-order cook, but with the solemn, ritualistic precision of a high priest. He did not speak. From a climate-controlled cabinet, he produced a single, perfect truffle, its aroma a funereal, earthy whisper. Eggs were fetched from a specific tray, their shells a uniform pale cream. Butter, pale gold and unsalted, was unwrapped from its parchment. A copper bowl was selected, its interior worn smooth by decades of whisking.

Elara watched, mesmerized despite herself. This was not cooking; it was alchemy born of rigid formula. He separated eggs with a single, confident crack, no fragment of shell in sight. He whisked the yolks with a pinch of fleur de sel over a bain-marie, the mixture thickening to a pale, creamy ribbon exactly at the moment his internal timer dictated. The truffle was shaved into translucent slivers that fell like black snow. The egg whites were beaten to peaks that stood with austere, unwavering stiffness.

He worked in absolute silence, save for the rhythmic scrape of whisk on copper, the gentle thump-thump of a rubber spatula folding clouds into velvet. When he finally plated, it was on a plain, white porcelain dish, pre-warmed. The soufflé emerged from the oven, a single, majestic golden dome, quivering with a life of its own. With a surgeon’s touch, he made a small incision in its top and nestled the truffle slices within, before dusting the summit with a snowdrift of finely grated Comté.

He placed it before her on the pass. No garnish, no sauce swirl, no frivolity. Just the dish, in its stark, perfect isolation.

“The Phoenix Egg,” he intoned. “As it was meant to be.”

Elara picked up her spoon. The crust gave way with a sigh, releasing a concentrated plume of scent: deep egg, earthy truffle, nutty cheese. It was profoundly familiar, yet somehow distant. She took a bite.

Technically, it was flawless. The texture was a miracle—a cloud with a soul, collapsing on the tongue into a rich, savoury custard. The truffle was present, respectful. The Comté provided a salty, crystalline finish. It was perfect. And it was as emotionally engaging as a geometry theorem.

She ate three more bites, her palate searching, analysing. It was pure. It was classic. It was, as Alain believed, the truth. But it was a truth embalmed. There was no joy in it, no surprise, no chef’s heartbeat thrumming beneath the technique. It was a magnificent replica.

“It is perfect,” she said, finally meeting his eyes.

He nodded, expecting nothing less.

“But it’s not yours, is it?”

The silence that followed was different. The previous quiet had been professional; this was volcanic. Alain’s face drained of its colour, leaving the grey of his eyes stark and frightening.

“What did you say?”

“The technique is Valère’s. The recipe is Valère’s. The philosophy is Valère’s.” Elara kept her voice low, pushing her plate aside. “Voltaire’s blackmail wasn’t about some notes, Alain. It was about the origin story. The ‘Alain the Classicist’ myth. You didn’t just steal his notes. You stole his voice. Your entire signature—this relentless, punishing purity—it’s not your creed. It’s his. And you’ve been performing it for thirty years.”

He didn’t deny it. He simply stood,
