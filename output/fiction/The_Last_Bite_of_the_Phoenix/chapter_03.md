Anton Voltaire stormed out of the kitchen, leaving Alain Desmarais shaken but resolute. The rest of the night blurred, the tension lingering long after the older man's departure. Alain tried to focus on his work, but his mind kept circling back to those words, the threat hanging over him like a specter.

As the night wore on, the kitchen grew quieter, the only sounds the soft hum of the refrigerator and the occasional creak of the old building. The notes, the recipes Anton Voltaire had accused him of stealing, dominated his thoughts. He knew he hadn’t taken them, but the suspicion lingered, a nagging doubt he couldn't shake.

The clock on the wall read 2:47 AM when Alain finally made his way to his small apartment above the kitchen. Exhaustion weighed on him, his mind reeling from the events of the night. He collapsed onto his bed, eyes drifting shut as fatigue washed over him.

Sleep eluded him, his mind racing with thoughts of Anton Voltaire and the notes. He tossed and turned, sheets tangling around him, unable to shake the unease. Only when the first light of dawn crept into the room did he finally drift off, his body exhausted but his mind still churning.

The next morning, Alain woke up drained, his eyes heavy. Stumbling out of bed, his movements were slow and deliberate as he made his way to the kitchen. Sunlight shone through the windows, casting a warm glow over the room. A sense of peace washed over him, a calm he hadn't felt in days.

But as he began to prepare breakfast, his thoughts turned back to Anton Voltaire and the notes. He had to talk to Elara Vance, to tell her everything. He couldn't shake the feeling that she was involved, that she knew more than she was letting on.

While he cooked, his mind racing with thoughts of the inspector and the investigation, he knew he had to be careful. He couldn't let his emotions get the better of him, not now, not when the stakes were so high. A deep breath steadied him, his eyes fixed on the stove as he let the calm settle in.

When Elara Vance arrived, Alain was already in the kitchen, a pot of coffee brewing on the stove. He greeted her with a nod, his eyes fixed on the cup he was pouring for her. "I've been thinking," he said, his voice low and even. "It's time we talked about what happened."

Elara's eyes narrowed, her expression guarded. "What do you mean?"

Alain set the cup down in front of her, his gaze locked on hers. "I mean what happened with Anton Voltaire. It's time we talked about it."

Her expression softened, eyes filling with a deep sadness. "I'm sorry, Alain. I had no idea."

His face twisted in a mixture of anger and pain. "You had no idea?" he repeated, his voice rising. "You had no idea what was going on?"

Elara's eyes dropped, her shoulders sagging under the weight of her guilt. "I'm sorry," she said again, her voice cracking. "I didn't know."

Alain's anger boiled over, his fists clenched at his sides. "You didn't know? You're the one who's been investigating me, accusing me of stealing the notes. You're the one trying to ruin my reputation."

Her eyes flashed up, her expression a mixture of shock and hurt. "I'm sorry," she whispered. "I didn't mean to hurt you."

His anger slowly began to dissipate, replaced by a deep sadness. He knew he had been wrong to accuse her, to assume the worst. A deep breath filled his lungs, his eyes locked on hers. "I'm sorry too," he whispered. "I shouldn't have assumed the worst."

Elara's expression softened, her eyes glistening. "I know. I'm sorry too."

For a moment, they stood there, the only sounds the soft hum of the refrigerator and the occasional creak of the old building. Alain knew he had to tell her everything, about the night Anton Voltaire died. He took a deep breath, his gaze steady on hers.

"It's time we talked about what really happened," he said, his voice low and even. "It's time we talked about the truth."

Elara's eyes narrowed, her expression guarded once more. "What do you mean?"

Alain's eyes locked on hers, his voice barely above a whisper. "I mean what really happened that night. I mean what really happened to Anton Voltaire."n to dissipate, replaced by a deep sadness.
