Chapter 5: The Third Suspect: Earth and Shadow

The city fell away behind Elara Vance like a discarded rind. The taxi wound up a narrow, serpentine road into the hills, where the air grew damp and cool, smelling of pine resin and wet stone. Anton Voltaire’s dossier had given her an address, but no image could have prepared her for the reality of Simone Thorne’s domain.

It wasn’t a house with a kitchen; it was a kitchen that had somehow grown a house around it. A sprawling, moss-choked cottage of dark timber and glass was all but swallowed by an eruption of greenhouses, cloches, and wild, untamed garden beds. Vines clutched at the eaves, and the late afternoon light filtered through a canopy of broad leaves, dappling the ground in shifting patterns of gold and deep green shadow. The air hummed with insects and was thick with the scent of blooming things—jasmine, rosemary, damp earth, and the faint, sweet rot of compost.

Elara Vance felt a pang of profound dislocation. After Alain Desmarais’s austere fortress and Kaito Tanaka’s sterile lab, this was a different world entirely. This was a place of growth, of chaos, of life in its raw, unfiltered state. It felt more alive than any place she’d been since the incident, and the vibrancy of it was a physical pressure against her skin.

A woman emerged from a greenhouse, wiping her hands on a canvas apron stained with soil and chlorophyll. Simone Thorne was in her late forties, with a fierce, weathered handsomeness. Her hair, streaked with silver, was tied back in a messy knot, and her eyes were the colour of dark, rich loam. She moved with a predator’s grace, utterly at home in her jungle.

“You’re the palate,” she said, her voice a low, rasping contralto. No greeting, no smile. “The one who sees ghosts. I wondered when you’d dig your way to me.”

“Elara Vance. Thank you for seeing me, Chef.”

Simone Thorne snorted. “Chef. A silly word. I’m a forager. A cultivator. A midwife to flavours. Come. The light’s fading, and the wood sorrel is at its peak.”

She led Elara Vance not into the house, but deeper into the garden labyrinth. They passed raised beds of unfamiliar herbs, shrubs heavy with berries in impossible shades of blue and black, mushrooms growing on purpose-built logs in a shady grotto. Every plant seemed to pulse with vitality. Simone Thorne’s fingers brushed leaves as she passed, a constant, intimate contact.

“Anton Voltaire thought he understood this,” Simone Thorne said, plucking a sprig of something feathery and green, crushing it beneath Elara Vance’s nose. It smelled of anise and pepper. “He thought it was just another ingredient, a commodity. He didn’t understand they have essence. Memory. The soil they grow in, the rain that feeds them, the hands that tend them—it’s all in the flavour. To eat my food is to taste this hillside, this specific moment in time.”

They arrived at an outdoor kitchen under a vast, cantilevered glass roof. It was shockingly well-equipped—a professional range, a sink carved from a single slab of stone, knives sharp enough to draw blood from the air—but it was also alive. Pots of thyme and marjoram sat beside the burners. A vine of tiny strawberries trailed across a shelf. The boundary between kitchen and garden was nonexistent.

“He was blackmailing you,” Elara Vance stated, leaning against a rough-hewn cedar post.

Simone Thorne didn’t flinch. She selected a knife and began slicing a strange, knobbly root with terrifying speed. “He called it ‘use.’ I called it theft. He wanted to steal my peace. My connection to this place.”

“What was your secret?”

The knife stilled. Simone Thorne looked up, and her earth-dark eyes held Elara Vance’s. “Do you know what it is to hold life and death in your palm, Elara Vance? Not as a metaphor. Literally.” She opened a small, locked cabinet above the sink. Inside were vials, dried specimens, carefully labelled jars of fungi. “This is my world. The line between sublime and fatal is sometimes the width of a gill, the shade of a spore print.”

She pulled out a photograph, faded and creased. It showed a younger Simone Thorne, smiling beside a man with a wild beard and eager eyes, both holding baskets overflowing with mushrooms. “Liam,” she said, the name a soft exhalation. “A rival. A brilliant, reckless forager. We were… competitive. Seven years ago, he brought me a specimen. A beautiful thing, apricot-coloured cap, elegant stem. He was sure it was Cantharellus, a golden chanterelle. He was wrong.”

Simone Thorne’s voice grew taut. “It was Omphalotus olearius. The jack-o’-lantern mushroom. Looks similar to the untrained eye, but it’s a gut-rotter. Violent illness, but rarely fatal… unless you have a weak heart. Which Liam did, a secret he kept from everyone.” She put the photo down, her fingers leaving faint smudges on the gloss. “I identified it for him. Told him it was poisonous. I was proud of my knowledge, sharp with my correction.”

“What happened?”

“He ate it anyway.” The words fell like stones. “Pride. Stubbornness. A forager’s ultimate sin—he trusted his own eye over confirmed fact. Or perhaps he wanted to prove me wrong. He died in agony two days later. There was an inquiry. It was ruled a tragic accident. But in our small, insular world… whispers started. That I’d misidentified it on purpose. That I’d given him the nudge that killed my greatest rival.”

The guilt and old fury radiated from her. Elara Vance could almost taste it—bitter, like willow bark.

“Anton Voltaire dug it up,” Simone Thorne continued, turning back to her root, slicing it into translucent moons. “He said he could ‘recontextualize’ the story for a new generation. Make it a tale of culinary sabotage, not tragic folly. He wanted a monthly tribute—a percentage of my sales from the restaurant I supply, or he’d go public with his ‘version.’ I was negotiating. I offered him a one-time settlement. A large one. We were to finalize it the night he died.” She looked squarely at Elara Vance. “It was an accident. A terrible, stupid accident. But it was not murder. Anton Voltaire misunderstood the earth. He thought it was passive. It is not. It is alive, and it has consequences.”

“Did you meet him that night? At the GastroNomia kitchen?”

Simone Thorne shook her head. “No. We spoke on the phone. He was… agitated. Said he had ‘bigger fish to fry’ but that our deal stood. He told me to bring the cash to his office the next afternoon.” A grim, humourless smile touched her lips. “Someone fried him first.”

She finished her prep and moved to the stove. What followed was not cooking as Elara Vance understood it. It was alchemy born of the soil. Simone Thorne took a handful of foraged greens—wood sorrel, miner’s lettuce, bittercress—and wilted them in a pan with a gloss of cold-pressed walnut oil. She grated the strange root, which now smelled of hazelnuts and damp forest floor, into a silky batter. A quick sear of a morel, its honeycomb cavities holding pools of fragrant butter. She worked in silence, utterly absorbed, her movements a fluid extension of the environment around her.

Finally, she presented the dish. It was called, simply, “Phoenix Egg.”

It was a free-form omelette, folded over the wild greens and the morel, but it looked like something hatched from the forest floor itself. The exterior was gilded and blistered, the interior a vibrant, chaotic green. It smelled of sun-warmed fields, deep woods, and a profound, stony minerality.

“Taste,” Simone Thorne commanded.

Elara Vance took a bite.

It was a revelation. The flavour was not a single note, but a chorus. The bright, lemony tang of sorrel, the peppery bite of cress, the deep, smoky earthiness of the morel, the rich, nutty undertone of the root. But beneath it all was the terroir—the unmistakable, undeniable taste of this hillside, this microclimate. It was vibrant, wild, and utterly honest. There was no ghost here, no echo of manipulation. Only life, potent and untamed.

And then, as she swallowed, it came.

The ghost note. Fainter in the complex symphony of the dish than in the other chefs’ samples, but undeniably present. It was the final, haunting thread she’d been tracking through all the Phoenix Eggs. Here, in its likely source, it was at its strongest. A floral note, sweet and woodland-fresh, with a faint, medicinal coolness at the finish, like the memory of shade.

“There’s a flower,” Elara Vance said, setting her fork down carefully. “In your dish. Something… sweet, cooling.”

Simone Thorne’s intense gaze sharpened. “You can taste them.” She walked to a shaded corner of the kitchen garden, where a delicate plant with heart-shaped leaves and small, hooded flowers of pale violet grew. She plucked a single bloom and handed it to Elara Vance. “Asperula orientalis. Some call it Heart’s Ease. It grows in one specific clearing, half a mile from here. It’s benign. Soothing. I use it as a finisher, a breath of the forest after the richness.”

Elara Vance brought the flower to her nose. The scent matched the ghost note perfectly. This was it. The source. But as she held it, a dissonance chimed in her memory. The note in Anton Voltaire’s fatal soufflé had been almost this… but with a sharper, almost almond-like edge beneath the sweetness. A toxic echo.

“Do you sell this? Give it to anyone?”

Simone Thorne shook her head. “It’s my secret. My signature. Only I forage it. Only I use it.” She studied Elara Vance’s face. “Why?”

“It was in Anton Voltaire’s soufflé. The one that killed him.”

The colour drained from Simone Thorne’s face, leaving her looking carved from old wood. “That’s impossible.”

“The note is there. In Alain Desmarais’s version, in Kaito Tanaka’s, in the crime scene sample. They all contained a trace of this, or something meant to mimic it.” Elara Vance’s mind raced. “You said only you use it. Could someone have stolen some? Followed you?”

Simone Thorne was silent for a long moment, her eyes scanning her wild domain as if seeing an intruder in every shadow. “There is… a look-alike,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “Galium odoratum. Sweet woodruff. Very similar leaf, similar flower. To the casual eye, almost identical. It’s not poisonous, but in large quantities, the coumarin it contains can cause headaches, dizziness.” She paused, and her next words were heavy with dread. “But there is another. Convallaria majalis. Lily of the valley. Also similar leaves. Beautiful, bell-shaped flowers. Every part of it is deadly. It contains convallatoxin. It affects the heart.”

The kitchen, once a haven of vibrant life, now felt like a cage of latent poison. The scents of the garden turned cloying, threatening.

“Would it taste similar?”

“To an amateur? Perhaps. The sweetness is there. But the toxic note… it’s bitter, acrid underneath. A master, or someone with a palate like yours, would detect the wrongness. But baked into a complex dish, masked by sugar, chocolate, egg…” Simone Thorne trailed off. “If someone used Convallaria, extracted its essence, and blended it to mimic my Heart’s Ease…”

“They wouldn’t just be framing you,” Elara Vance finished, cold understanding dawning. “They’d be using your signature to commit murder. Turning your ‘essence’ into a weapon.”

Simone Thorne moved quickly. She took a small muslin sachet and filled it with the dried, pale violet flowers from a sealed jar. She thrust it into Elara Vance’s hand. “Take this. The true Heart’s Ease. Compare it. Know the difference.” Her grip was fierce. “Find who did this. They are not just a killer. They are a poisoner of truth. They have violated the sanctity of the earth itself.”

Back in her apartment, the world felt thin and artificial. The city lights outside her window were a poor imitation of the vibrant, dangerous life of Simone Thorne’s hill.

Elara Vance brewed a cup of plain hot water. She opened Simone Thorne’s sachet. The dried flowers released their scent: sweet, woodland-fresh, with that clean, medicinal finish. She steeped one, took a sip. The ghost note resolved into pure, benign clarity. This was the note in Simone Thorne’s cooking. This was the chef’s true signature.

Then, from her locked case, she took the tiny, sealed vial of the crime scene soufflé extract she’d begged from Silas Vance Harris. It was barely a drop, clinging to the glass. She diluted it, her heart hammering against her ribs. She tasted the true Heart’s Ease again, searing the memory onto her palate.

She brought the diluted soufflé extract to her lips.

The initial note was a perfect mimic—the same sweet, floral top note. But as it faded, the truth emerged. Not the clean, cooling finish of Heart’s Ease. This was darker. A faint, bitter almond sharpness that curled unpleasantly on the tongue, leaving a metallic tingle of warning. The ghost had a face now. It was not a memory of Simone Thorne’s forest.

It was the smile of a killer who knew botany, who knew the chefs, who knew how to twist a secret into a snare. Someone who had harvested not from a sun-dappled clearing, but from the shadowed soil of malice, and planted evidence meant to blossom into a case against the forager.

The hook was set. The bait was laid. And Elara Vance now held the proof that the murder weapon was not just a poisoned soufflé, but a poisoned idea—a flawless, deadly imitation of a rival’s heart.
