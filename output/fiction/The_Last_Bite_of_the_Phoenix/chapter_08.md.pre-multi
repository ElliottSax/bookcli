Chapter 8: Confession in Batter

The rain had softened to a persistent mist by the time Elara found the food truck. It was parked in a derelict lot on the industrial edge of the city, where the cobblestones gave way to cracked asphalt and the scent of the river was a cold, metallic rot. The truck itself was a relic—a battered chrome Airstream with the faded, peeling decal of a rising phoenix. Gwen’s Flames, it read, the letters almost ghostly. Light bled from its single service window, a jaundiced yellow square in the gloom, illuminating the swirling vapour of grease and sugar that escaped into the damp air.

Inside, Elara could see a shadow moving. The rhythmic scrape of a metal spatula on a griddle. The sizzle of butter meeting heat. Her own breath fogged before her as she approached, each step feeling irrevocable. The door was unlocked.

The interior was a capsule of focused heat and startling order. Unlike the chaotic, living abundance of Simone’s greenhouse, this was a surgeon’s theatre. Every utensil hung from a magnetic bar, gleaming. Ingredients were in stainless steel containers, labelled with precise tape. And at the centre of it all, her back to the door, stood Gwen. She was whisking a bowl of batter, her movements economical, hypnotic. She didn’t turn.

“I wondered if you’d prefer the rain to my company,” Gwen said, her voice flat, stripped of its usual sardonic edge. “Close the door. You’re letting the draft in. It’s bad for the eggs.”

Elara did, the click of the latch loud in the small space. The atmosphere was thick, pressurized. It smelled of browned butter, vanilla pod, and beneath it, a faint, floral note she couldn’t place—not the cloying perfume of Simone’s False Heart’s Ease, but something deeper, more melancholy.

“You knew I’d come,” Elara said.

“I knew someone would. The logic was always going to lead here. To the person with the most to gain, and the most to lose.” Gwen finally turned. She looked older under the harsh work light, the lines around her eyes not from laughter but from squinting into ovens and over hot oil. Her hands, now still, were a map of old burns and nicks. “I just hoped it would be you. You see the ingredients, not just the plate.”

“You swapped the flowers,” Elara stated, the words hanging between them like a cleaver.

Gwen didn’t flinch. She set the bowl down and wiped her hands on a pristine towel. “Yes. The night before the Gala. Simone’s greenhouse is a temple to her own ego. She loves to give tours, to show off her precious, dangerous children. It was easy to note which plant was which. Easier still to return later, when the city was asleep and she was dreaming of her own brilliance. The lock on the side pane is rusted through.”

The confession was so matter-of-fact it was chilling. Elara leaned against a stainless steel counter, the cold seeping through her coat. “You took her True Heart’s Ease. And you left the False one in its place.”

“A fair trade. She stole my father’s life. I stole
