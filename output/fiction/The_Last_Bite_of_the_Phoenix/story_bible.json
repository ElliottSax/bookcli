      "description": "Late 30s. Talented but scarred, possessing a preternatural palate\u2014'the gift'\u2014that allows her to taste not just flavors, but the emotions and intentions behind a dish. Wears a borrowed, ill-fitting chef's jacket at the gala, but is at home in her food truck apron.",

      "description": "The city's most feared and powerful food critic. A man whose reviews wielded financial and reputational life-or-death power.

  "narrative_voice": "Close third-person, primarily from Elara Vance's perspective. The prose is sensory and evocative, especially regarding taste and smell, often using culinary metaphors to describe emotional states and environments. It can shift from bitter and cynical in elite settings to more fluid and purposeful in the food truck.",

  "plot_summary": "On the night of the prestigious Gala of the Golden Phoenix, feared critic Anton Voltaire is poisoned by a dish meant for a rival. Elara Vance, a fallen chef working the event, is thrust into the investigation when her unique palate\u2014'the gift'\u2014becomes crucial. Using her ability to taste the emotions and history in food, she follows a trail of culinary clues, navigating the cutthroat world of high-end restaurants and its wounded chefs. Each suspect's dish tells a story of humiliation, stolen recipes, or ruined careers. The mystery deepens beyond simple revenge, revealing Voltaire's role in a larger, more systemic corruption. In solving the crime, Elara is forced to confront her own bitterness. The case culminates not with a dramatic arrest alone, but with her choosing a different path: rejecting the world of destructive criticism. In the final scene at her food truck, she uses her gift not to condemn, but to guide a struggling young cook, transforming critique into collaboration and finding her true purpose in nurturing the raw, honest intention behind the food."
