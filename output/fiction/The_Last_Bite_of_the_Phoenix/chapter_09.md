Chapter 9: The Bitter Truth

The forest outside the city was a different world. The damp air of the city's high-end restaurant kitchens, with their sterile, pressure-cooker environments, gave way to a cool, green scent that smelled of decaying leaves, wet earth, and the faint, sweet smell of autumn. Elara Vance stood at the edge of the treeline, where the silence heavy after the constant metallic noise of L'Oiseau de Feu. The only sounds here were the drip of condensation from skeletal branches and the distant call of a crow. She held a photocopied page from a decades-old police report, with the coordinates of the forager's death circled in smudged blue ink.
Gwen's words from the night before still lingered in the air. "She sent him into the wrong patch," Gwen had said. "She told him the Amanita caesarea was flourishing by the old oak. But it was Amanita phalloides, the Death Cap. She knew the difference - I saw her compare the spore prints the week before."

Simone Thorne had defended herself by saying it was a tragic mistake. A young, ambitious chef, she had trusted a seasoned forager's judgment, and anyone could have made the same error. This explanation had helped cement her reputation as a resilient figure who had risen from the ashes of another's misfortune.
As Elara walked deeper into the forest, her boots sank into the spongy moss. The light filtered through the trees, casting a soft glow over the forest floor. She was searching for two specific landmarks: a lightning-blasted oak and a fallen birch that had been described in the report. The forager, Henri, had been found curled between them, his basket of poisonous mushrooms spilled beside him.
Elara found the spot by the sweet, overpowering smell of mushrooms in the air. There, she saw the oak, its charred branch reaching toward the sky, and the birch, a soft, white mound covered in moss and ferns. Around their bases, a circle of fungi grew. They were beautiful, but deceptive. One cluster of mushrooms had caps the color of egg yolks and stems that looked like polished ivory - these were the edible Caesar's mushrooms, prized for their delicate flavor. Just a few feet away, another cluster grew, with caps that were a more olive-toned yellow and stems that were ringed. These were the Death Caps, almost indistinguishable from the Caesar's mushrooms to the untrained eye.
Elara's heart was racing as she knelt down, the damp earth seeping through her trousers. She pulled out a small knife and a porcelain plate, feeling like she was violating this peaceful, natural place. With careful precision, she harvested one of each type of mushroom. On the white plate, the difference between them became clearer. The Caesar's cap was a brighter, cleaner yellow, and Elara could see the distinction more easily.
