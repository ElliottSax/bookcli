The rain had softened to a persistent mist by the time Elara Vance found the food truck. It was parked in a derelict lot on the industrial edge of the city, where the cobblestones gave way to cracked asphalt and the scent of the river was a cold, metallic rot. The air clung to her skin like a damp shroud, weighing her down with every step. The only sound was the soft patter of raindrops on the pavement, a relentless beat that appeared to match the thrumming of her own heart.

Ingredients were in stainless steel containers, labelled with precise tape. The labels themselves were a marvel of attention to detail, each one proof of Gwen's meticulous nature. And at the centre of it all, her back to the door, stood Gwen. She was whisking a bowl of batter, her movements economical, hypnotic. The motion was almost meditative, a soothing balm for the soul.

As she waited, Elara Vance's eyes roamed the city's high-end restaurant kitchens, taking in the precision of Gwen's workspace.
