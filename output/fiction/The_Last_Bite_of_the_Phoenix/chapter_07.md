 milk, a humble, creamy dish. The kind of thing a sous-chef might whip up from scraps. But Elara Vance knew that every chef, no matter how junior, left their fingerprint in their food. She needed to see if Gwen’s was there.

She found the kitchen manager, a harried woman named Maria, in the pantry. “Do you still have the inventory from that night?”

Maria blinked. “You mean the night of the murder? Of course. We had to account for every ingredient for the investigation. It’s all in the system.”

Elara Vance pulled up the digital log. The rice, the milk, the vanilla, the sugar. All standard. But then she saw it. A single line item, tucked between the flour and the salt. “Moss extract, 10g.”

Moss extract. A common enough ingredient, used for its earthy, umami depth. But in the wrong hands, it could be deadly. The right strain, processed incorrectly, could contain a neurotoxin. And Simone Thorne Laurent’s signature ingredient was moss.

Elara Vance’s pulse thrummed in her throat. She needed to confirm. She needed to taste.

She found Gwen in the staff locker room, changing out of her whites. The woman looked up, startled, then composed her face into something neutral. “Silas Vance. Is there something I can help you with?”

Elara Vance leaned against the doorframe, casual. “Just wrapping up some loose ends. I was thinking about that riz au lait you made for the staff that night. It must have been a comfort, after everything.”

Gwen’s fingers stilled on her shirt buttons. “It was just something to do. Something familiar.”

“You’re from Oregon, right? I’ve heard the rice pudding there is exceptional. Especially with a touch of wild moss.”

Gwen’s breath hitched, just slightly. “I suppose. I don’t remember.”

Elara Vance stepped closer. “You know, I’ve been trying to figure out how the poison got into the soufflé. It’s a delicate thing, adding something so subtle, so personal. Someone would have to know Simone Thorne’s style inside out. Someone who had worked in her kitchen, maybe. Or someone who had studied her for years.”

Gwen’s hands curled into fists. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Elara Vance smiled, slow and cold. “I think you do. And I think you’re going to tell me everything. Starting with how you got your hands on that moss.”

Gwen’s face twisted, a mask of grief and fury. “You think you know everything, don’t you? You think you can just come in here and judge. But you have no idea what it’s like to watch your father’s life, his legacy, get torn apart. To watch the people who did it get rewarded, celebrated. Simone Thorne Laurent didn’t just take his livelihood. She took his soul. And now she’s taken everything from me.”

Elara Vance’s heart pounded, but her voice was steady. “And you thought framing her for murder would bring it all back? Make it right?”

Gwen’s laugh was bitter. “No. It would make it end. I didn’t care about the money, the fame. I just wanted her to pay. To feel what it’s like to lose everything. And now, because of you, it’s all falling apart.”

Elara Vance stepped closer, her voice a whisper. “It’s over, Gwen. You’re done. But you can still tell me the truth. About the moss. About how you got it into the soufflé. About everything.”

Gwen’s shoulders slumped, the fight draining out of her. “Fine. But you’ll never understand. You’ll never know what it’s like to lose everything.”

Elara Vance’s voice was soft. “Try me.”

Gwen took a deep breath, her voice barely above a whisper. “I found the moss in my father’s old journals. He had been experimenting with it, trying to find a way to make it safe. But it was too dangerous. I knew Simone Thorne used it, so I figured it would be the perfect way to frame her. I just needed to get it into the soufflé. I knew the timing, the chaos. I knew I could do it.”

Elara Vance’s mind raced, piecing together the final details. “And the vinegar? How did you get that into the mix?”

Gwen’s eyes flashed. “Anton Voltaire. He was the one who suggested it. He said it would add a unique touch, something no one would expect. I knew it would be the perfect way to make it look like Simone Thorne’s work.”

Elara Vance’s stomach twisted. “And the note? The one that said ‘For the Wild Pantry’?”

Gwen’s voice was cold. “A little insurance. I knew it would be the final nail in the coffin.”

Elara Vance’s voice was steady. “It’s over, Gwen. You’re done. But you can still tell me the truth. About the moss. About how you got it into the soufflé. About everything.”

Gwen’s shoulders slumped, the fight draining out of her. “Fine. But you’ll never understand. You’ll never know what it’s like to lose everything.”
