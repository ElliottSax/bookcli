Chapter 7: Recipe for a Frame-Up

Chapter 7: Recipe for a Frame-Up

The rain had settled into a permanent state over the city, a fine, persistent mist that turned the windows of The Wandering Skillet into smeared canvases of grey and gold. Inside, the air was thick with the comforting, low-tide scent of a dashi simmering since dawn, but Elara tasted only ash. She stood before her evidence board, a mosaic of photographs, timelines, and frantic notes that had, until an hour ago, pointed in three clear, conflicting directions. Now, they swirled into a single, chilling vortex.

She had been asking the wrong question. Not who killed Voltaire? But who needed Simone Laurent to have killed Voltaire?

The answer had begun with logistics, the dry, unfeeling mathematics of murder.

Elara had spent the previous day in the cavernous, now-silent gala kitchen. With Liam’s authority, she had recreated the final, frantic ninety minutes of service. She mapped the choreography of the three stars: Alain’s station by the roaring hearth, a kingdom of copper and fire; Kaito’s gleaming, temperature-controlled alcove, a surgical theatre; Simone’s wild corner, littered with moss-lined baskets and strange, earthy roots. They were planets in separate orbits, connected only by the comets of runners and sous-chefs.

The Phoenix Soufflé was the finale. Each chef contributed a component: Alain, the base, a cognac-laced béchamel of profound depth; Kaito, the aerated meringue, stabilized with a seaweed-derived alginate; Simone, the final garnish, a dusting of powdered, edible gold and a single, crystallized violet. The assembled dish would then be rushed to the pass, where Voltaire would add his own touch—a drop of a rare, aged vinegar—before it was swept to the Mayor.

But between the assembly and the pass, there was a gap. A breath.

“Show me again,” Elara had ordered the terrified chef de partie who had been on runners that night. “From the moment the last component went into the dish.”

They had walked it through. Alain, after smoothing his perfect base into the porcelain ramekin, was called to the pass by a shouting match over a sous-vide duck. Kaito, injecting his meringue with a precision syringe, had been summoned by a supplier on the phone about a failed delivery of Arctic cloudberries. Simone, her violet placed, had turned to wash the earthy scent from her hands. The completed, unbaked soufflé sat on a central counter, a crown jewel on a stainless-steel altar.

For exactly ninety seconds, it was unattended by any of the three.

“And who was in the kitchen then?” Elara had asked, her voice dangerously soft.

“Everyone, no one,” the runner stammered. “The push for the main was on. It was chaos. But… the station was near the cold larder. Gwen was going in and out. Fetching butter, I think.”

Gwen. Gwendolyn Shaw. Junior sous-chef. A woman of such quiet competence she was practically invisible. Elara remembered her from the night of the death—a pale, watchful face in the sobbing, angry crowd, her hands, scarred by oil and knife nicks, clenched at her sides. She had given a statement so bland it was forgettable: she’d been prepping garnish, she’d seen nothing, she admired all the chefs equally.

Elara had pulled her file. Thirty-two. Trained at a solid but unremarkable culinary school in Portland. Worked at a farm-to-table spot in Oregon, then a brief, six-month stint at Alain’s Le Pré Carré three years ago. A subsequent four months in Kaito’s research kitchen. She’d been at the gala kitchen for a year. A professional journeyman, building her skills. Utterly unremarkable.

But then Elara dug deeper, into the life before the resume. Gwen Shaw’s father had been Arthur Shaw, a renowned independent forager who supplied rare mushrooms and wild herbs to high-end restaurants across the Pacific Northwest. His name rang a faint, tragic bell. A news search brought up a brief, local article from seven years ago: “Prominent Forager Dies in Fall.” The obituary was vague, citing a tragic accident on a remote hillside near the Oregon border. The date made Elara’s blood cool. It was two weeks after Simone Laurent had given a celebrated interview to The Epicurean, unveiling her now-famous “Wild Pantry” map, detailing and claiming foraging territories.

A call to a retired county sheriff, now living in Arizona and happy to gossip, filled in the blanks. “Arthur Shaw? Yeah, bitter guy at the end. That Frenchwoman, Laurent, she published her map. Basically drew a target on all the best patches. Corporate foragers moved in, bought up leasing rights. Shaw’s secret spots, spots his family had used for decades, were gone. He was ruined. Went out one morning in a rage, they said, trying to find a new patch no one knew. Slipped on a wet scree slope. Broke his neck. They found him with a half-full basket of chanterelles.”

Simone hadn’t pushed him. But she had, with her brilliant, territorial flourish, taken his world away. A death by a thousand legal cuts, ending with one fatal slip.

Gwen Shaw had been twenty-five. She’d left Oregon soon after. And begun a quiet, deliberate pilgrimage through the kitchens of the three chefs now dominating the city’s scene. Learning their ways. Their weaknesses.

The motive was no longer hidden; it was a slow-cooked poison, simmering for seven years. But was it enough? Framing Simone required more than opportunity and hatred. It required a deep, intimate knowledge of her style, her ingredients, her secret poison. And it required a palate subtle enough to weave that poison into a dish so perfectly that it would sing of Simone’s hand.

Elara needed to taste Gwen’s hand.

She went back to the gala kitchen staff manifests. The night of the murder, after the chaos had subsided and the police had begun their initial, clumsy questioning, the remaining staff had been held for hours. Around 2 AM, someone had made a family meal. Something simple, comforting. The record showed it was Gwen. She’d made a riz au lait—rice pudding. A humble dish. But the notes mentioned she’d infused the cream with bay and a hint of black walnut.

Black walnut. Bitter, complex, tannic. A difficult note to balance.

Elara tracked down two line cooks who’d eaten it. “It was weirdly good,” one recalled, a young man named Diego. “Sad, but good. The bay was there, but the bitter finish… it kind of cleaned your palate. Made you want another bite, even though you were dead inside. Never tasted anything like it from staff meal.”

That was the signature. The same subtle, bitter balance that had allowed the False Heart’s Ease to hide within the soufflé’s rich symphony. Not a clumsy addition, but an integration. A chef’s touch.

Elara’s final stop was the police evidence locker. Liam, his face grim with the weight of her theory, had pulled the tiny, remaining sample of the poisoned soufflé. He’d also, at her urging, secured the staff meal leftovers, a sad container of congealed rice pudding. In the sterile, fluorescent-lit lab, they tasted them side-by-side, tiny dots on the tips of sterile spoons.

The soufflé was a ghost of its former self, a stale, eggy whisper. But beneath the faded cognac and the ghost of vinegar, there it was: a clean, almost refreshing bitterness that lifted the fat, a precise, surgical note.

Then, the pudding. Cold, texture gone. But the bay was a distant forest, and the finish… a clean, almost refreshing bitterness that lifted the fat.

They were not the same ingredient. But they were the same hand. The same artistic choice. A palate obsessed with using bitterness not as a flaw, but as a structural beam, a reveal.

“It’s her,” Elara whispered, the taste lingering on her tongue like a confession. “She learned bitterness from her father’s loss. She honed it in Alain’s kitchen of brown butter and burnt sugar, in Kaito’s lab of acids and aldehydes. And she weaponized it with Simone’s own poison.”

Liam had stared at the samples. “She had the motive. She had the access. She had the skill. And she had the perfect frame—Simone’ rivalry with Voltaire, her secret poison, her presence at the dish. It’s… a masterpiece of malice.”

“It’s a recipe,” Elara corrected, hollowly. “Followed to the letter.”

Now, back in the Skillet, Elara knew she had to move. Liam was preparing warrants. But something gnawed at her—the why now? Why frame Simone at Voltaire’s moment of triumph? The answer, she suspected, was in the final, cruel flourish: to make Simone not just a murderer, but a failed one. To have her watch her life’s work, her wild kingdom, be inherited by the very rivals she despised, while she rotted in a cell. It was a dish best served at the moment of supreme anticipation, then shattered.

Elara needed air, to clear the toxic aftertaste of the case from her own palate. She grabbed her coat, intending to walk to the precinct, to meet Liam and finalize the plan.

She pushed open the back door of the Skillet, into the narrow, rain-slicked alley where the dumpsters hummed and the bricks wept. The mist kissed her face.

“Chef Elara.”

The voice was calm, soft, utterly familiar from a hundred quiet kitchen interactions. It came from the shadows by the delivery door.

Gwen Shaw stepped into the dim, jaundiced light of a security bulb. She was still in her kitchen whites, pristine but for a few smudges of what looked like dark chocolate or soil. Her face was placid, a pale moon. In one hand, she held a chef’s knife, its honed edge catching the light in a dull gleam. It was held not in threat, but in readiness, like an extension of her arm.

In her other hand, balanced on a plain kitchen towel, was a single, perfect, porcelain ramekin. From it rose a soufflé. It was magnificent, a golden-brown crown that trembled with a barely-contained breath, its height defying gravity and the damp, cold air. The scent that drifted from it was ethereal—browned butter, airborne egg, a hint of cognac, and beneath it all, that faint, clean, bitter promise.

“I thought you might be hungry,” Gwen said, her eyes fixed on Elara’s. They were not the eyes of a frantic killer, but of a chef awaiting a critique. “After all your hard work. Tasting is believing, isn’t it?”

She took a step forward, the knife point dipping slightly towards the soufflé. “This one is just for you. A replica. I even have the vinegar.” She nodded to a small, antique dropper bottle on the towel beside the ramekin. “Would you like to finish it? It’s the chef’s privilege.”

The alley seemed to shrink, the walls closing in. The only sounds were the distant hiss of traffic, the drip of water, and the almost imperceptible sigh of the collapsing soufflé—a sound like a last, desperate breath. The rich, comforting aroma now smelled only of the grave.

Elara stood frozen, the back door handle cold against her spine. The masterpiece of malice was complete, and the chef was offering her the last bite.
