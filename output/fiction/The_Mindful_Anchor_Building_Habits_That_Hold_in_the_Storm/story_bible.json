Her life is violently upended by a phone call informing her of her father's catastrophic stroke. Thrust into the chaotic, sensory-overload world of hospital vigils, her old tools for coping fail. The narrative traces her dissolution and subsequent, gradual reconstruction.

The ending finds her not at a final destination, but at a point of integration\u2014carrying her scars and wisdom as a 'compass' for an ongoing, self-authored life, stepping forward with a quiet confidence born of surviving the storm.",
