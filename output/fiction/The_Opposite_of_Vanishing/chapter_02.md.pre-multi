Chapter 2: The Art of Forgetting

The old, creaky wooden floorboards beneath her feet seemed to groan in unison with her own weary sighs as Iris made her way to the kitchen. It was a sound she had grown accustomed to over the years, a sound that echoed through the empty halls of the Callahan house like a melancholy serenade. The house, with its faded grandeur and peeling paint, stood as a testament to the transience of time and the inevitability of decline. Yet, despite its worn exterior, the house still held a certain charm, a certain character that Iris, ever the cataloguer, couldn't help but mentally note for preservation.

As she entered the kitchen, the warm glow of the morning sunlight streaming through the window illuminated the dusty air, casting a golden sheen over the outdated appliances and worn countertops. Iris’s gaze, sharp and assessing, went to the old refrigerator, its door a museum of faded photographs and yellowed newspaper clippings. Her eyes fixed on a particular picture, one of her and her sister, Eleanor, taken on a summer afternoon long past. The empirical data of that day—the temperature, the species of tree in the background—was clear, but the emotional resonance felt like corrupted file, glitching at the edges.

Iris's forensic thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her mother's voice, a soft, melodic thread from the living room. "Lena, my love, would you care for some coffee?" The voice was frail, each word chosen and placed with deliberate care, as if conserving energy.

Iris made her way to the living room, her steps precise. Eleanor Callahan sat on the couch, a small island of quiet dignity amidst the familiar clutter. The TV murmured in the background. Eleanor's eyes, the color of weathered sea glass, looked up to meet her daughter's.

"Affirmative. I'll procure it," Iris replied, her terminology clinical even in domesticity. "The pot is at eighty-two degrees Celsius. Optimal."

As she poured the coffee, the rich aroma filled the air. Iris handed her mother a cup, and they sat together on the couch, the warmth a tangible variable in the room's atmosphere.

They sat in a silence that was not entirely empty. It was filled with Eleanor’s soft, rhythmic breathing and the faint tap of Iris’s finger against her ceramic mug, a subconscious processing tic. Iris’s mind began to access memory files: Eleanor reading poetry in the garden, the specific phonetic cadence of her laughter.

Eleanor's voice wove into the quiet, her words tentative yet firm. "Darling, I've been turning it over... perhaps we might begin to sort your father's study." The words were gentle, but they landed with the weight of a final draft.

Iris felt a system alert—a spike in respiratory and heart rate. Her father's passing was an unsorted dataset, a chaotic terminal left open. Engaging with his physical parameters now seemed a high-risk operation.

"My emotional readiness is not calibrated for that task," Iris stated, her voice flattening into a monotone defense. "The probability of psychological disruption is currently too high."

Eleanor's eyes held hers, a deep, liquid understanding in them. "I know the weight of it, sweet girl. But even the most beautiful verse must sometimes make way for a new line. We must learn the gentle art of... setting things aside."

The phrase "setting things aside" triggered a cascade of conflicting protocols. *Forget* was not a valid command. *Archive*, yes. *Analyze*, absolutely. But not delete. "Setting aside is a logical fallacy when the data is integral to the system's history," Iris countered, her words coming faster. "It is not 'gentle.' It is deletion."

As they sat there, the new silence was a live wire. Iris’s mind raced, running diagnostics on her own reaction. The sound of the TV was a low-frequency irritant.

The spell was shattered by the shrill, insistent ring of Iris’s phone—a stark, digital sound. She stood, a motion of pure relief. "That will be Samuel. His timing, as ever, is algorithmically poor but functionally useful." She moved to answer, escaping the unresolved equation of the couch.
