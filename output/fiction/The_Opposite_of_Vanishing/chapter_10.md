The night air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the distant hum of crickets. Emma's eyes sparkled with a sense of wonder as she gazed out at the stars, her mind still reeling from the discovery she had made earlier that day.

As she stood on the porch, Jack's arm wrapped around her shoulders, pulling her close. "You okay?" he asked, his voice low and gentle.

Emma nodded, her eyes never leaving the stars. "Yeah, I'm fine," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Jack's arm tightened around her, holding her close. "You're shaking," he said, his voice filled with concern.

Emma's eyes dropped to the ground, her face flushing with embarrassment. "I'm sorry," she said, her voice barely audible.

Jack's arm wrapped around her, holding her close. "Don't be sorry," he said, his voice filled with warmth. "You're just emotional, that's all."

Emma's eyes met Jack's, and she smiled. "I guess I am," she said, her voice filled with a sense of wonder.

As they stood there, surrounded by the silence of the night, Emma felt a sense of peace wash over her. She had found what she was looking for – a sense of connection, a sense of belonging.

The stars twinkled like diamonds in the sky above, and Emma's eyes sparkled with a sense of laughter and joy. She felt a sense of freedom, a sense of release, as if she had finally found the one thing she had been searching for her whole life.

As the night wore on, Emma's thoughts turned to her mother, and the stories she had read in the letters. She felt a sense of connection to her, a sense of understanding, as if she had finally found the missing piece of the puzzle.

The wind rustled through the trees, and Emma's eyes met Jack's. "I'm glad we did this," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Jack's eyes met hers, and he smiled. "Me too," he said, his voice low and even.

The screen door creaked as Emma pushed it open, the hinges groaning like an old man’s bones. Inside, the house smelled of wood smoke and lavender, the scent of her grandmother’s soap still lingering in the air. The floorboards groaned under her weight as she stepped into the dimly lit kitchen, the only light coming from the flickering flame of a single candle on the table.

Jack followed her in, his boots scuffing against the worn linoleum. “You sure you’re okay?” he asked again, his voice rough with concern.

Emma turned to him, her fingers tracing the edge of the table. “I’m just… processing,” she said, her voice quiet. “It’s a lot to take in.”

Jack exhaled, running a hand through his hair. “I get that. But you don’t have to do it alone.”

She looked up at him, her eyes reflecting the candlelight. “I know. It’s just…” She hesitated, her fingers tightening around the edge of the table. “I never knew my mother’s family. Not really. And now, to find out there’s this whole other side of me I never even knew existed…”

Jack stepped closer, his hand resting on her shoulder. “You’re not alone in this, Emma. You’ve got me. And your grandmother. And whatever else you need.”

Emma swallowed hard, her throat tight. “I just… I don’t know what to do with it all.”

Jack’s thumb brushed against her shoulder, a small, comforting gesture. “You don’t have to do anything right now. Just… let it sink in.”

Emma nodded, her eyes dropping to the table. “I think I need to see her,” she said softly. “My grandmother. I need to ask her about all of this.”

Jack’s hand squeezed her shoulder. “Then we’ll go. Tomorrow. Whatever you need.”

Emma looked up at him, her eyes searching his. “Thank you,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Jack’s lips curled into a small smile. “Anytime.”

The candle flickered, casting long shadows on the walls. Emma’s fingers traced the grain of the wood, her mind racing. “Do you think she’ll tell me the truth?” she asked, her voice uncertain.

Jack’s hand slid down her arm, his fingers intertwining with hers. “I think she’ll tell you what she can. And if she can’t… well, we’ll figure it out together.”

Emma’s fingers tightened around his, her grip firm. “Together,” she repeated, her voice steady.

Jack’s eyes met hers, his gaze steady. “Together.”

The candle burned low, the flame casting a warm glow over the kitchen. Emma’s fingers traced the edge of the table, her mind a whirl of thoughts and emotions. But for the first time in a long time, she didn’t feel alone. She had Jack. And that was enough.

The wind rustled the leaves outside, the sound a soft whisper in the night. Emma’s fingers tightened around Jack’s, her grip firm. She was ready. Ready to face whatever came next. Ready to find the truth. Ready to find herself.

Jack's eyes met hers, and he smiled. "Me too," he said, his voice low and even.
