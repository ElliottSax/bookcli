Chapter 2: The Art of Forgetting

Creaky wooden floorboards groaned beneath Iris's feet as she walked to the kitchen, her sighs echoing through the empty halls of the Callahan house. The sound was a familiar one, a reminder of the house's faded grandeur and peeling paint, which showed the effects of time and the inevitability of decline. Despite its worn exterior, the house still had a certain charm that Iris, who liked to notice details, found herself take note of.
As she entered the kitchen, warm morning sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the dusty air and casting a golden glow over the outdated appliances and worn countertops. Iris's gaze fell on the old refrigerator, which was covered in faded photographs and yellowed newspaper clippings. One picture in particular caught her eye - a photo of her and her sister, Eleanor, taken on a summer afternoon. She remembered the details of that day, but the emotions that came with it were hazy. She recalled the sunlight in her hair and her sister's laughter, but the memory was bittersweet, a reminder of happier times.
A soft voice from the living room interrupted Iris's thoughts. "Lena, my love, would you like some coffee?" Her mother's voice was weak, and each word was chosen carefully, as if to conserve energy. Eleanor's way of speaking was gentle and old-fashioned, with a tendency to soften her requests into questions. There was a sadness underlying her words, a reminder of the loss of Iris's father, who had been the center of their family.
Iris walked into the living room, her steps deliberate. The TV murmured in the background, a constant reminder of the world outside, which had kept moving even as their family's life had come to a standstill. Eleanor sat on the couch, her frail frame proof of the passing years. The scent of lavender wafted from her perfume, a fragrance that reminded Iris of her father.
Iris looked into her mother's eyes, which were deep and expressive, holding a world of emotions. Those eyes appeared to hold many secrets, each one a story of love, loss, and longing. Iris surge of love and empathy for her mother, and she wanted to help her through this difficult time.
"Yes," Iris replied, using a formal tone even in everyday conversation. "I'll get it." She often used technical language as a way to hide her emotions, turning feelings into facts. Her mind worked like a system of equations and codes, and it was easier for her to navigate the world through numbers and logic than to deal with messy emotions.
As she poured the coffee, Iris breathed in the rich aroma, which took her back to her childhood. She had spent many mornings in this kitchen, watching her mother make breakfast while her father worked in his study. The smell of freshly brewed coffee reminded her of the happy times they had shared before her father's illness had taken over.
Iris handed her mother a cup, and they sat together on the couch, feeling the warmth of the room. Silence fell between them, filled with the sound of Eleanor's gentle breathing and the faint tap of Iris's finger against her mug, a habit she wasn't aware of. The sound was barely noticeable, but it was there, a reminder that even in the stillness, emotions were simmering just below the surface. Iris's mind recall memories, each one a snapshot of a happy moment.
Eleanor's voice broke the silence, her words tentative but firm. "Darling, I've been thinking... maybe we should start sorting your father's study?" The words were gentle, but they had a significant impact. Iris reaction, a spike in her heart rate. Her father's passing was still a difficult topic, and dealing with his belongings seemed like a challenging task, one she wasn't sure she was ready for.
“My emotional readiness is not calibrated for that task,” Iris stated, her voice flattening into a monotone defense. “The probability of psychological disruption is currently too high.” A familiar sense of discomfort settled in, feelings of being trapped in a never-ending loop of grief. Memories of her father flooded her mind—the way he used to make her laugh, the way he used to hold her hand—each one a painful reminder of what they had lost.
Eleanor’s eyes held hers, a deep, liquid understanding. “Oh, my dear heart, I know. It’s a dreadful mountain. But we cannot let the room become a tomb.” She paused, her fingers tracing the rim of her cup. “Samuel Reyes, our friend from the estate, will be here by noon. He can bring boxes and help us sort through the chaos. We can do this, Lena. We can face it together.”

A minor cache dump in her mind: reliable, solid, a man who spoke in grounded, practical fragments. His voice in her memory was warm and slightly graveled, his sentences often trailing off into actionable silence. *‘I can bring boxes. We’ll take it slow.’* The image of his rugged features and weathered skin flashed before her eyes, a reminder of the man who had been a steady presence in her life.
“His assistance would be… logistically efficient,” Iris conceded, the admission feeling like a vulnerability. “But the parameters need to be defined. No unscheduled reminiscence. It is a cataloguing project, not an archival one.” She twinge of anxiety,hints off being trapped in a never-ending cycle of rules and protocols.
“Of course, my love,” Eleanor said, a faint, knowing smile touching her lips. “Just a project. We shall be very... systematic.” She reached over and placed her parchment-thin hand over Iris’s, stilling the tapping finger. “We’ll have Samuel for the heavy lifting. And you, my brilliant girl, can be our curator.”

The touch was a surprise, a gentle, comforting gesture that reminded Iris of the love and connection they still shared, despite the pain of their loss. She looked at her mother, and saw the faint lines of worry etched on her face, the deep sadness in her eyes. And Iris knew that this was simply the beginning, that the road ahead would be long and difficult.
As she glanced at her mother, Iris spark of hope ignite within her, a spark that she hadn’t in a long time. Maybe, just maybe, they could do this. Maybe they could sort through the chaos of her father’s study, and find a way to heal, to move forward.
“Let’s do it,” she said, her voice firm and resolute. “Let’s sort through this, together.” The words like a promise, a vow to face the unknown with courage and determination.
Eleanor’s face lit up with a small, tentative smile, and she nodded, her eyes shining with tears. “Yes, my love. Let’s do it.” The sound of her mother’s voice was like a balm to Iris’s soul, a reminder that she was not alone in this journey. Together, they would face the chaos of her father’s study, and find a way to heal, to move forward.
The silence between theto fade, replaced by aanticipation and possibility.

The warm sunlight streaming through the window cast a golden glow over the room, illuminating the dust motes that danced in the air. The scent of lavender and coffee filled the air, a heady mix of memories and emotions.

But they knew that they would face them together, side by side, as they navigated the complex, beautiful, and difficult road ahead.
