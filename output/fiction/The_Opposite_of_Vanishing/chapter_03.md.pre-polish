**Chapter 3: The Art of Being Still**

The old wooden dock was a familiar symphony of complaint, each plank groaning a specific note beneath Lena’s weight as she walked to its very end. The wood, silvered by decades of sun and scoured by winter ice, was warm under her bare feet, the grain raised and textured like braille. She curled her toes over the edge, where the wood met nothing but air and the reflected sky. The lake was a perfect, breathless mirror this evening, holding the heavens captive in its still, darkening waters. The sunset wasn’t just a visual event; it was a physical presence. The air itself seemed stained with colour—a damp, cool pink that tasted faintly of distant rain on the wind, an orange that warmed the skin on her arms. The scent was a complex layers: wet stone from the far shore, the sweet, decaying perfume of water lilies, the crisp, clean smell of pine carried from the woods behind the cottage, and beneath it all, the profound, mineral smell of deep, cold water. It was a smell that bypassed memory and went straight to the marrow, a direct line to her eight-year-old self.

As a child, this dock had been a spaceship, a pirate’s plank, a royal observatory. She had lain on her stomach for hours, her chin digging into the warm wood, watching the universe that teemed just beneath the surface: sunfish like shards of discarded pottery hovering in the sunbeams, water beetles rowing their frantic, tiny courses, the shadow of a bass, slow and imperial, patrolling the weed-choked depths. Her grandfather, a man of few words, had taught her the names of the clouds—cumulus, cirrus, the anvil-headed thunderheads that marched across the lake in summer—while her grandmother had taught her the language of silence. Lena could still see her, a silhouette against the blazing evening sky, sitting perfectly still in the old Adirondack chair, a blanket over her knees long after the chill set in. “The world is always moving, Lena-bird,” she’d say, her voice as soft as the lapping water, “but it’s the pauses that make life worth living. You have to learn the art of being still. The fish won’t show themselves if you’re dancing a jig.”

*The art of being still.* Lena closed her eyes, trying to summon that childhood discipline. But her stillness now wasn’t observant; it was paralyzed. Her mind was a frantic, skittering thing—a water beetle on the surface, not the patient bass below. Job applications vanished into digital voids. The four walls of her city apartment seemed to lean in closer each day. Friends’ lives progressed on social media in a bright, relentless scroll of milestones, while hers felt like a record stuck in a dusty groove. *If only I could find a pause now,* she thought, the memory a physical ache, a hollowing out beneath her ribs. *Instead of this… this freefall. I’m not pausing. I’m just falling, and I can’t see the bottom.*

The sound of footsteps on the dock was a soft, deliberate counter-rhythm to her thoughts. Not the bold, confident thump of her grandfather, but something lighter, more tentative. Lena didn’t turn. She let the person—she knew it was Rachel—enter the periphery of her solitude, let the dock adjust to the new weight. The footsteps stopped a few feet behind her.

“Hey.” Rachel’s voice was a careful thing, feathered at the edges to keep from startling her.

Lena finally glanced over her shoulder. Rachel stood holding two steaming mugs, her long, curly hair a dark corona against the fiery sky. She’d tied it back, but rebellious strands had escaped, framing a face that was all gentle concern. Her bright green eyes, usually sparkling with a joke or a plan, were watchful, soft. She looked like someone holding out a hand to a creature they feared might bolt.

“I brought reinforcements,” Rachel said, offering a mug. “Chamomile. With a squeeze of lemon and a criminal amount of honey. Just like your Gran used to make.”

*What I need is for the ground to be solid again,* Lena thought. *What I need is a map.* But she took the mug, the heat of the ceramic almost too intense against her chilled palms. She wrapped her fingers tightly around it, a small, desperate anchor, and brought it to her nose. The steam carried the floral, apple-like scent of chamomile, undercut by the sharp, clean note of lemon. It was a smell that meant safety, that meant knitted blankets and a hand on a fevered forehead. Her throat tightened unexpectedly.

“Thanks, Rach,” she managed, her voice raspy from disuse. She took a careful sip, the sweet, hot liquid a trail of warmth down into the cold pit of her stomach. “I was just… lost in thought.”

*Lost. That’s the right word for it. Adrift. Untethered.*

Rachel nodded, not needing the translation. She moved to sit on the dock’s edge, lowering herself with a quiet, deliberate grace. The old wood gave a long, low groan of protest. She set her own mug down and picked at a splinter, her brow furrowed not in annoyance, but in a kind of tender focus. “I can see that,” she said, her gaze fixed on her task. “You’ve been doing a lot of that lately, haven’t you? The lost-in-thought thing.”

It wasn’t an accusation. It was an observation, gently laid between them like another piece of driftwood. Lena exhaled slowly, a breath that seemed to come from the soles of her feet, shuddering its way out. She watched the steam from her mug rise and vanish into the twilight. “I guess I have. It’s just… everything feels so…” She searched for a word grand enough, terrible enough. “…*amorphous*. Like I’m trying to grab hold of smoke. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know where I’m going. I don’t even know what I’m supposed to *want* to do.” The words, once started, came in a quiet flood. “Everyone else seems to have a script. A next scene. I’m just standing backstage in the dark.”

*I’m scared,* she didn’t say, but the words screamed in the space between every syllable. *I’m so terribly, utterly scared that this is it. That the freefall is just… flying in an empty sky.*

Rachel didn’t offer empty platitudes. She didn’t say *it will be okay*. Instead, her hand came to rest on Lena’s shoulder, a firm, steady pressure that seemed to radiate calm. Her touch was warm through the thin cotton of Lena’s shirt, a tether to the physical world. “You’re not alone in the dark, okay?” Rachel’s words were deliberate, each one a stone placed to build a path. “I’m back there with you. Half our friends are. We’re all just… holding each other’s elbows, trying not to trip over the props.” She gave Lena’s shoulder a gentle, grounding squeeze before pulling her hand back, folding it in her lap. “And you know what your grandmother would say? She’d say sometimes the best scenes are the improvised ones. The ones that aren’t in the script.”

A wry, fragile smile touched Lena’s lips. She looked from her mug to Rachel’s profile, etched against the dying light. “You’re channelling her tonight. She did always say the best moments were the ones you stumbled upon by accident. The hidden patch of wild strawberries. The owl you see only because you dropped your pencil.”

*She also said not all stumbles lead to good places,* Lena remembered, the thought a cold stone in her gut. *Sometimes you stumble into a hornet’s nest, or off a cliff you didn’t see. She had a romantic view, but she was a realist, too.* She kept that part to herself.

Rachel’s eyes lit up, seizing the connection. “See? Wise woman. I always loved her stories.” She paused, sipping her own tea. “Remember that one she told about getting lost on the hiking trail in Scotland? And finding that tiny, perfect loch no map ever showed?”

Lena’s gaze drifted out to where a family of swans glided, their movement creating the only ripples on the glassy surface. They were a vision of serene, unquestioning purpose. “I remember. She said the map’s destination was just an excuse. The real treasure was the being lost.” *A wonder I seem to have lost,* Lena thought. *The treasure feels like just being… lost.*

As they lapsed into silence, the world underwent its final transformation. The vibrant, boastful colours of the sunset bled away, leaving behind a palette of profound blues and dusky purples. The first star, defiantly bright, pierced the canopy overhead. The air grew hushed, the daytime insects surrendering to the rhythmic, pulsing chorus of crickets and peepers from the reed beds. The lake’s surface turned from a mirror to a sheet of obsidian, absorbing the last light. For a suspended moment, Lena felt it—the ghost of that childhood peace. It settled over her shoulders like a shawl woven from cool air and distant frog-song, so fragile she dared not breathe for fear of scattering it.

It was Rachel who finally broke the spell, her voice soft, tentative, as if speaking too loudly might shatter the twilight. “You know, I’ve been thinking…” She trailed off, picking up a small, flat stone and skimming it absently across the dark water. It hopped twice with soft *plip-plip* sounds before vanishing.

Lena turned her head, a silent prompt in the gloom.

Rachel took a breath, her words gaining speed, infused with a hopeful energy she was visibly trying to temper. “Maybe we should take a road trip. A proper one.” She glanced at Lena, checking for a reaction. “Just the two of us. No agenda, no five-year-plan, no LinkedIn updates. Just… a car, a tank of gas, and a questionable playlist.”

Lena felt a flicker, not quite interest, but a shift in the stagnant air. “A road trip to where?”

“Anywhere! Nowhere!” Rachel said, a hint of her usual enthusiasm breaking through. “We could drive out to the coast, sleep in crappy motels that smell like salt and mildew, eat greasy spoons for breakfast. Or we could point the car north, get lost in those mountains past the reservoir, the ones we always said we’d explore. Remember? We’d find a lake even more secret than this one.”

“We have jobs, Rachel,” Lena said, but the protest was automatic, hollow. Her job was a ghost of one, a remote data-entry purgatory she could do from anywhere with Wi-Fi.

“I have two weeks of vacation I haven’t touched. You’re… between engagements,” Rachel said carefully, diplomatically. “It’s not running away. It’s… reconnaissance. A geographical cure for a spiritual malaise.” She grinned, a flash of white in the dark. “I’ve been reading poetry.”

Lena managed a small laugh, the sound strange to her own ears. “A geographical cure? Is that a thing?”

“It is now. Look,” Rachel’s tone softened, becoming earnest. “You’re trying to hear your own thoughts, but this place… it’s full of echoes. Good echoes, but echoes all the same. Of your grandparents, of who you were. Maybe you need some neutral territory. Some empty road where the only voice is your own, and maybe mine, singing horribly off-key to nineties pop.”

The idea unspooled in Lena’s mind, both terrifying and tantalizing. To move without a destination. To be a blur against a landscape, rather than a stationary weight. It felt adjacent to her grandmother’s philosophy—not being still, but moving with a purpose that was exploration itself.

“What if we get really, truly lost?” Lena asked, the real question beneath the question.

Rachel found another stone, a smoother one, and pressed it into Lena’s palm. It was still warm from the day’s sun. “Then we’ll be lost together. And we’ll have to rely on the art of being still to figure it out. We’ll have to stop the car, get out, and just… listen. To the wind, to the map we didn’t bring, to whatever it is we’re actually trying to find.”

Lena closed her fingers around the stone, its solidity a comfort. She looked from Rachel’s hopeful face to the vast, star-dusted sky, then down to the inky water that held the entire cosmos in its quiet embrace. The freefall sensation didn’t vanish, but it changed. It wasn’t a plunge into darkness anymore. It felt, for the first time in months, like a step off a dock—a voluntary launch into deep, unknown water. The destination wasn’t clear, but the motion was her own.

She took a last sip of the now-lukewarm tea, the ghost of her grandmother’s remedy on her tongue. “A questionable playlist, huh?” she finally said, her voice a little stronger. “What’s on it?”

Rachel’s smile was a victory in the dark. “Oh, you know. The good, the bad, and the deeply embarrassing. All the songs that make you feel like you’re in a movie, even when you’re just in a beat-up sedan on a highway to nowhere.”

Lena nodded slowly, the decision crystallizing not in a grand pronouncement, but in a quiet release of breath. “Okay,” she said. The word was small, but it landed in the stillness with the weight of a promise. “Okay, let’s get lost.”

And as they sat there in the consuming dark, the lake silent and vast before them, the first firefly of the evening blinked on—a tiny, brave, and wandering star in the grass, charting its own course through the unknown.
