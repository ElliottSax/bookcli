**Chapter 3: The Art of Being Still**

The old wooden dock let out its familiar chorus of complaint, each plank groaning under Lena’s weight as she walked to the very end. Silvered by decades of sun and scoured by winter ice, the wood was warm under her bare feet, the grain raised and textured like braille. She curled her toes over the edge, where the wood met nothing but air and the reflected sky. This evening, the lake was a perfect, breathless mirror, holding the heavens in its still, darkening waters. Sunset wasn’t just something to see; it was something to feel. The air seemed stained with colour—a damp, cool pink that tasted faintly of distant rain, an orange that warmed her skin. Wet stone from the far shore, the sweet, decaying smell of water lilies, the crisp scent of pine from the woods behind the cottage, and under it all, the deep, mineral smell of cold water: the layers of scent went past memory and straight to the bone, a direct line to her eight-year-old self.
As a child, this dock had been a spaceship, a pirate’s plank, a royal observatory. For hours, she had lain on her stomach, chin digging into the warm wood, watching the world that lived just beneath the surface: sunfish like shards of pottery hovering in the sunbeams, water beetles rowing their frantic paths, the shadow of a bass, slow and commanding, patrolling the weedy depths. Her grandfather, a man of few words, had taught her the names of the clouds—cumulus, cirrus, the anvil-headed thunderheads that marched across the lake in summer—while her grandmother had taught her the language of silence. Lena could still see her, a silhouette against the evening sky, sitting perfectly still in the old Adirondack chair, a blanket over her knees long after the chill set in. “The world is always moving, Lena-bird,” she’d say, her voice as soft as the lapping water, “but it’s the pauses that make life worth living. You have to learn the art of being still. The fish won’t show themselves if you’re dancing a jig.”

*The art of being still.* Lena closed her eyes, trying to find that childhood focus. But her stillness now wasn’t watchful; it was frozen. Her mind was frantic, skittering like a water beetle on the surface, not the patient bass below. Job applications vanished into digital voids. Each day, the four walls of her city apartment appeared to lean in closer. On social media, friends’ lives moved forward in a bright, steady stream of milestones, while hers like a record stuck in a dusty groove. *If only I could find a pause now,* she thought, the memory a physical ache, a hollow feeling under her ribs. *Instead of this… this freefall. I’m not pausing. I’m simply falling, and I can’t see the bottom.*

Soft and deliberate, a counter-rhythm to her thoughts, footsteps sounded on the dock. Not the bold, confident thump of her grandfather, but something lighter, more hesitant. Lena didn’t turn. She let the person—she knew it was Rachel—enter the edge of her solitude, let the dock adjust to the new weight. The footsteps stopped a few feet behind her.
“Hey.” Rachel’s voice was careful, softened to keep from startling her.
Lena finally glanced over her shoulder. Rachel stood holding two steaming mugs, her long, curly hair a dark halo against the fiery sky. She’d tied it back, but stray strands had escaped, framing a face full of gentle concern. Usually sparkling with a joke or a plan, her bright green eyes were watchful, soft. She looked like someone holding out a hand to a creature they feared might run.
“I brought reinforcements,” Rachel said, offering a mug. “Chamomile. With a squeeze of lemon and a criminal amount of honey. Just like your Gran used to make.”

*What I need is for the ground to be solid again,* Lena thought. *What I need is a map.* But she took the mug, the heat of the ceramic almost too intense against her chilled palms. Her fingers wrapped tightly around it, a small, desperate anchor, and she brought it to her nose. The steam carried the floral, apple-like scent of chamomile, undercut by the sharp, clean note of lemon. It was a smell that meant safety, that meant knitted blankets and a hand on a fevered forehead. Her throat tightened unexpectedly.
“Thanks, Rach,” she managed, her voice raspy from disuse. A careful sip sent the sweet, hot liquid tracing a path of warmth down into a cold, hollow space deep within her. “I wa merely st… lost in thought.”

*Lost. That’s the right word for it. Adrift. Untethered.*

Rachel nodded, not needing the translation. With a quiet, deliberate movement, she sat down on the dock's edge. The old wood creaked in protest. She set her mug down and picked at a splinter, her brow furrowed in a gentle, focused way. "I can see that," she said, her eyes fixed on her task. "You've been lost in thought a lot lately, haven't you?"

It wasn't an accusation, just an observation. Lena breath escape from her, and she watched the steam from her mug rise and vanish into the twilight. "I guess I have. Ionlyjust... everything feels so unclear. Like I'm trying to grab hold of something that's not there. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know where I'm going. I don't even know what I want to do." The words came out in a quiet rush. "Everyone else seems to have a plan. A next step. I'm just standing still, unsure of what to do."

Lena didn't say she was scared, but the fear was evident in her voice. Rachel didn't offer empty reassurances. Instead, she put her hand on Lena's shoulder, a firm, steady pressure thato calm her. Her touch was warm through the thin cotton of Lena's shirt, a connection to the physical world. "You're not alone," Rachel replied. "I'm here with you. Many of our friends are in the same situation. We're simplyjust trying to find our way, holding on to each other for support." She gave Lena's shoulder a gentle squeeze before pulling her hand back, folding it in her lap. "And you know what your grandmother would say? She'd say sometimes the best things in life are the ones you don't plan for."

A small, fragile smile touched Lena's lips. She looked from her mug to Rachel's profile, outlined against the fading light. "You're reminding me of her tonight. She always said the best moments were the ones you stumbled upon by accident. Like finding a hidden patch of wild strawberries or seeing an owl because you dropped your pencil."

Lena remembered that her grandmother had al answered not all unexpected events lead to good things, but she kept that thought to herself.
Rachel's eyes lit up, making a connection. "See? She was a wise woman. I always loved her stories." She paused, sipping her tea. "Remember that one she told about getting lost on a hiking trail in Scotland and finding a tiny, perfect lake that wasn't on any map?"

Lena's gaze drifted out to where a family of swans glided across the lake, their movement creating the only ripples on the calm surface. They seemed to xactly where they were going. "I remember. She said the destination wasn't the point. The journey, the process of getting lost, was what mattered." Lena thought she had lost that sense of wonder, that the unknown more like being lost than an adventure.
As they sat in silence, the world changed around them. The colors of the sunset faded, leaving behind a palette of deep blues and purples. The first star appeared, bright and clear. The air grew quiet, with only the sound of crickets and peepers from the reeds breaking the silence. The lake's surface turned dark, absorbing the last light. For a moment, Lena feelings of peace, a feeling she hadn't experienced in a long time. It was fragile, and she didn't want to break the spell.
It was Rachel who finally spoke, her voice soft and tentative. "I've been thinking..." She trailed off, picking up a tiny stone and skimming it across the water. It made a soft sound before disappearing.
Lena turned her head, waiting for Rachel to continue.
Rachel took a breath, her words coming out in a rush. "Maybe we should take a road trip. Just the two of us. No plan, no schedule, no expectatMerely. Just a car, a tank of gas, and some music." She glanced at Lena, waiting for a reaction.
Lena spark of interest, not excitement, but a sense that something might be possible. "A road trip to where?"

“Anywhere! Nowhere!” murmuredel said, a hint of her usual enthusiasm breaking through. “We could drive out to the coast, sleep in crappy motels that smell like salt and mildew, eat greasy spoons for breakfast. Or we could point the car north, get lost in those mountains past the reservoir, the ones we always said we’d explore. Remember? We’d find a lake even more secret than this one.”

“We have jobs, Racwhispered” Lena said, but the protest was automatic, hollow. Her job was a ghost of one, a remote data-entry purgatory she could do from anywhere with Wi-Fi.
“I have two weeks of vacation I haven’t touched. You’re… between engagements,” Rachel said carefully, diplomatically. “It’s not running away. It’s… reconnaissance. A geographical cure for a spiritual malaise.” She grinned, a flash of white in the dark. “I’ve been reading poetry.”

Lena managed a small laugh, the sound strange to her own ears. “A geographical cure? Is that a thing?”

“It is now. Look,” Rachel’s tone softened, becoming earnest. “You’re trying to hear your own thoughts, but this place… it’s full of echoes. Good echoes, but echoes all the same. Of your grandparents, of who you were. Maybe you need some neutral territory. Some empty road where the only voice is your own, and maybe mine, singing horribly off-key to nineties pop.”

The idea unspooled in Lena’s mind, both terrifying and tantalizing. To move without a destination. To be a blur against a landscape, rather than a stationary weight. It adjacent to her grandmother’s philosophy—not being still, but moving with a purpose that was exploration itself.
“What if we get really, truly lost?” Lena asked, the real question beneath the question.
Rachel found another stone, a smoother one, and pressed it into Lena’s palm. It was still warm from the day’s sun. “Then we’ll be lost together. And we’ll have to rely on the art of being still to figure it out. We’ll have to stop the car, get out, and just… listen. To the wind, to the map we didn’t bring, to whatever it is we’re actually trying to find.”

Lena closed her fingers around the stone, its solidity a comfort. She looked from Rachel’s hopeful face to the vast, star-dusted sky, then down to the inky water that held the entire cosmos in its quiet embrace. The freefall sensation didn’t vanish, but it changed. It wasn’t a plunge into darkness anymore. It felt, for the first time in months, like a step off a dock—a voluntary launch into deep, unknown water. The destination wasn’t clear, but the motion was her own.
She took a last sip of the now-lukewarm tea, the ghost of her grandmother’s remedy on her tongue. “A questionable playlist, hustatedshe finally said, her voice a little stronger. “What’s on it?”

Rachel’s smile was a victory in the dark. “Oh, you know. The excellent, the bad, and the deeply embarrassing. All the songs that make you feel like you’re in a movie, even whenonly’re just in a beat-up sedan on a highway to nowhere.”

Lena nodded slowly, the decision crystallizing not in a grand pronouncement, but in a quiet release of breath. “Okay,” she said. The word was slittle but it landed in the stillness with the weight of a promise. “Okay, let’s get lost.”

And as they sat there in the consuming dark, the lake silent and vast before them, the first firefly of the evening blinked on—a tiny, brave, and wandering star in the grass, charting its own course through the unknown.
