Chapter 9: The Wolf Revealed

Chapter 9: The Wolf Revealed

The scent of rain-washed earth and the damp, sweet rot of autumn leaves seeped through the kitchen window Eleanor Vance had cracked open. It was a smell that spoke of endings, of things returning to the soil. She sat at the scrubbed pine table, the Marmalade Manuscript open before her like a patient on an operating table. Around it, arranged in a constellation of quiet accusation, were Agatha’s coded notes. They were no longer fragments. Under Eleanor Vance’s careful, patient hands, they had clicked together into a terrible, coherent truth.

The fire in the Aga murmured to itself, casting a buttery light over the pages. The coded script, once a whimsical puzzle, now felt like a heartbeat captured in ink—Agatha’s furious, frightened pulse from fifty years ago.

‘The shepherd tends his flock with a public smile,’ one note read, ‘but his eyes are for the one ewe lamb who strays from the fold. He calls it spiritual guidance. The garden wall hears a different confession.’

Eleanor Vance traced the words. The Reverend Alistair Finch. The village’s beloved, stooped patriarch with his kind eyes and endless fundraisers for the church roof. In her earlier, discreet inquiries—a chat with Mrs. Prentiss about the history of the church flower roster, a cup of tea with old Mr. Henderson who’d been a choirboy—a different portrait had begun to emerge. A man of “high spirits” in his youth, a little too fond of taking the girls from the Sunday school on “nature walks.” A man whose wife had been a quiet, faded woman, perpetually apologising for his “enthusiasm.” The discrepancy between the saintly reputation and the whispers was a crack in the village’s foundation, and Agatha had peered right into it.

The next note was plainer, blunter. ‘Lily confided in the rose arbour. He wrote her letters. She kept them. She called him a wolf. She said the wool of his cassock itched her conscience. She threatened to show the letters to the Bishop when he wouldn’t leave her be.’

Eleanor Vance could see it. Young, vibrant Lily, with her laugh that carried across the green, being cornered by the earnest, intense young reverend. His attentions, cloaked in piety, becoming a suffocating weight. The threat of exposure—not just of his advances, but of the hypocrisy that would shatter his life’s work—would have been a seismic shock to a man like Finch.

Then came the note that chilled the warm kitchen. It was written on a different paper, a scrap of ledger, the ink a furious, blurred blue as if rain had spotted it. ‘The river was high. The argument was a simmering thing on the bank. I heard it from the path, but the willows hid them. His voice, low and desperate. Hers, sharp as broken glass. Then… a silence that swallowed the sound of the water.’

Agatha hadn’t witnessed the act. But she had pieced together the aftermath with the ruthless logic of a woman who understood human frailty and violence. Another note, written later in a tremulous hand: ‘An ‘accidental’ drowning. A body found downstream, caught in the reeds. No letters were ever found. No questions asked of the shepherd. The flock closed ranks around him. Grief is a convenient blanket.’

Eleanor Vance sat back, her tea gone cold. The pieces were all there. Agatha believed Lily had been killed by Reverend Finch that night by the river, her death staged as a tragic mishap. The village, in its shock and its innate desire to protect its own, especially its spiritual leader, had chosen the simpler, kinder story. They had buried the wolf in shepherd’s clothing under a mountain of collective goodwill.

But Agatha hadn’t stopped there. The final note in the sequence was the key to everything—the break-in, the scattered cookbooks, the lingering fear in the village air.

‘A theory is a puff of smoke,’ Agatha had written, the letters precise and firm. ‘It disperses. But evidence is a stone. It sinks to the bottom and remains. I have gathered stones. I have written it all down. Not here. Not in these silly codes. The truth is in the book only a true seeker will find. He suspects. I see it in his eyes at the fête, when he looks at me across the jam stall. The wolf is old now, but he still has teeth. And he is afraid of the stone.’

“The book,” Eleanor Vance whispered to the quiet room. “Not a book. The book.”

Her gaze swept to the wall of cookbooks, now neatly re-shelved but still feeling violated. They hadn’t been looking for the Manuscript. They’d been looking for Agatha’s other book—the plain, factual, damning record she’d hinted at. The one that named names, that detailed times and places, that perhaps even speculated on where Lily’s letters might be hidden. The intruder, Reverend Finch or someone acting for him, feared Agatha had written it all down. They’d torn the cottage apart looking for that final, incontrovertible stone.

Eleanor Vance’s heart ached for Agatha. She had lived with this knowledge for decades, watching the Reverend age into a village monument, showered with respect and affection. She had dropped her coded hints into the Manuscript, a silent scream in a jar of marmalade. And she had waited, trusting that one day, someone with enough curiosity and enough love for the truth would follow the trail of crumbs.

The weight of it was immense. This wasn’t a dusty historical puzzle anymore; it was a latent crime, a murderer who might still be breathing the same damp autumn air. She thought of the Reverend now—frail, using a walker, his sermons read for him by a curate. Were those still the eyes of a wolf? Or just the milky, confused eyes of an old man? Justice, after fifty years, seemed a nebulous, complicated thing. But truth… truth was simpler. Lily deserved her truth.

A heavy knock at the front door shattered her reverie.

Eleanor Vance jumped, her hand flying to her throat. The clock on the mantel chimed half-eight. Too late for casual visitors. The knock came again, not aggressive, but solid and unavoidable.

She moved through the shadowed sitting room, the floral patterns on the armchairs seeming to watch her pass. She opened the door to a slice of cool, misty night.

Thomas the butcher stood on the cobbled path. He wasn’t in his blood-streaked apron, but in a stiff-looking navy jacket, his large hands clenched at his sides. The ruddy, confident face she was used to seeing across his counter was ashen. The light from the hallway caught the sheen of sweat on his broad forehead.

“Miss Eleanor Vance,” he said, his voice a gravelly whisper. “I… I need to come in.”

It wasn’t a request. It was the statement of a drowning man sighting a raft.

“Thomas? Is everything alright?” she asked, stepping back automatically.

He shuffled in, filling her narrow hallway with his presence and the faint, perpetual scent of sawdust and cold meat. He didn’t wait for an invitation further, but walked straight into the kitchen, drawn to the light like a moth. He stood staring at the Aga, his back to her, shoulders hunched.

“I saw your light,” he said, still facing away. “I’ve been walking. Around the green. Down by the river. For hours. I can’t… I can’t carry it no more.”

Eleanor Vance closed the front door softly, her mind racing. This wasn’t about sausages or a misplaced order. “Carry what, Thomas? Would you like some tea?”

He gave a sharp, bitter bark that was nothing like a laugh. “Tea. My mother always said tea was the answer to everything. It didn’t answer nothing that night.” He finally turned. His eyes, usually crinkled with good humour, were wide and haunted. “It’s about Lily. And the Reverend. And… and Agatha.”

The names hung in the warm kitchen like three ghosts summoned. Eleanor Vance felt the Manuscript on the table behind her, pulsing with relevance. She said nothing, just pulled out a chair for him and sat opposite, waiting.

Thomas sank into the chair, the wood groaning. He put his big, capable hands flat on the table, as if to steady himself. “You’ve been asking questions. Nice-like. Polite. For your aunt’s history.” He looked directly at her, his gaze pleading. “But it ain’t for no history, is it? Agatha… she left you something. She talked to me, you know. In the shop. Odd things, about remembering, about bones not staying buried. I thought she was just getting old.”

“She left me her cookbook,” Eleanor Vance said carefully.

“Aye. And more than that, I reckon.” He took a deep, shuddering breath. “I was fifteen. A strong lad, helping my dad in the shop already. I’d… I’d had a bit of a fondness for Lily. We all had. She was like sunshine. She’d come in for kidneys for her father’s breakfast, and she’d always have a kind word, a joke.”

He looked past Eleanor Vance, into the middle distance of memory. “That night, the night she… went… I’d been to see a friend over in Pocklington. Came back late, along the river path. It was dark, moon behind clouds. I heard them before I saw them. Voices, up by the old willow, the one that’s half-toppled now.”

“Who, Thomas?”

“The Reverend. And Lily.” The words dropped like stones. “He wasn’t preaching. His voice was… different. Tight. Angry. Pleading, all at once. I heard him say ‘You’ll ruin everything, you foolish girl. Give them to me.’ And Lily… she was crying, but she was fierce. She said, ‘They’re mine. And I’ll show them to the whole world, you… you hypocrite.’ Then there was a scuffling sound. A gasp. Not a scream, just a… a sharp intake, cut off.”

Thomas’s own breath was coming in short pants now. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “I was frozen. Hidden in the hawthorn bushes. I didn’t understand, not properly. I was just a lad. Then I saw him, the Reverend, stumbling back onto the path alone. His clothes were wet, up to the knees. He looked wild, like an animal. He looked right towards my hiding spot. I swear he saw me. I held my breath. And then he just… walked away. Fast, towards the vicarage.”

The kitchen was silent except for the pop of the Aga and Thomas’s ragged breathing. The story Agatha had theorised was now flesh and blood and sound, narrated by a trembling, fifty-year-old ghost.

“What did you do?” Eleanor Vance asked softly.

“I waited ‘til he was gone. Then I crept to the riverbank. The water was black and fast. There was nothing. No Lily. Just… a scuffle in the mud, and her little hair ribbon, the blue one, caught on a root.” His voice broke. “I took it. I don’t know why. I was terrified. I ran home, hid it in my toolbox. I still have it.”

“You never told anyone?”

“Who would I tell?” he cried, a sudden burst of anguish. “The Reverend? The police? His best friend was the Chief Constable! He’d seen me, I was sure of it. For weeks, I waited for him to come to the shop, to say something. He never did. But he’d look at me in church, and his eyes… they weren’t holy. They were a warning. My dad would have thrashed me for lying about a man of God. The village would have eaten my family alive.” He dropped his head into his hands. “So I said nothing. I watched them drag the river three days later. I stood with the crowd when they pulled her out. I saw the Reverend lead the service, crying real tears. And I felt sick to my soul.”

Eleanor Vance reached out, instinctively covering one of his huge, trembling hands with her own. It was ice-cold. “Oh, Thomas.”

“I’ve carried it every day,” he sobbed, a raw, ugly sound from such a large man. “It’s in every joint I cut, in every smile I give a customer. It’s why I never left. I was a prisoner of it. And Agatha… she knew. Not the details, but she knew something. She’d give me these long looks. She once said, ‘The truth weighs heavy on the conscience, but it’s lighter than a lie on the soul, Thomas.’ I thought she was just being daft.”

“She was piecing it together,” Eleanor Vance said. “She suspected the Reverend. She believed Lily was murdered.”

Thomas nodded, wiping his eyes with his sleeve. “When Agatha died, part of me was relieved. The only other person who seemed to question it was gone. But then you came. And you started asking. And then your break-in… I knew. He’s still afraid. He’s old, he’s frail, but that fear… it’s strong. He thinks Agatha wrote it down. He’s looking for proof.”

“He is,” Eleanor Vance confirmed. “Or someone is on his behalf.”

Thomas looked at the scattered notes on the table, at the open Manuscript. “Is that it? Agatha’s proof?”

“It’s her theory. Coded. She hints at another book, a proper record. That’s what they were looking for.”

A strange, resigned calm settled over Thomas. The confession had emptied him. “What do we do, Miss Eleanor Vance? It’s my word against a dead saint’s. And I’m a coward who waited fifty years.”

Eleanor Vance looked at the broken man, then at the careful, courageous words of her great-aunt. The quiet persistence of curiosity. It had led here, to this raw, painful truth. Justice might be beyond them. But the truth, now, belonged to more than just Agatha.

“We don’t do anything rash,” she said, her own voice surprising her with its steadiness. “We think. We protect what we have. And we remember Lily.”

Thomas nodded, some colour returning to his face, as if the simple act of sharing the poison had diluted it. He stood up, looking older and yet somehow younger than when he’d arrived. “I should go. I’m sorry for… all this.”

“Don’t be,” Eleanor Vance said, walking him to the door. “Thank you for telling me. It took courage.”

He gave a small, sad smile. “Fifty years too late.” He stepped out into the mist. “You’ll be careful? He’s still out there. And a cornered wolf…”

“I’ll be careful.”

She closed the door, leaning against it. The cottage, once a sanctuary, now felt like the quiet eye of a storm. She had the testimony. She had Agatha’s coded accusation. But where was Agatha’s final, factual record? The other book? Without it, it was still just a theory and the memory of a terrified boy.

She returned to the kitchen, her eyes scanning the walls of cookbooks. ‘The truth is in the book only a true seeker will find.’ Agatha wouldn’t have hidden it somewhere obvious. It would be in plain sight, waiting for the right eyes.

Eleanor Vance’s gaze fell on the one book that didn’t belong on the cookery shelves: the fat, ancient, leather-bound Bible on the little table by the window. Agatha’s Bible. Eleanor Vance had glanced at it before, seen the pressed flowers, the marginal notes in a spidery hand. A book for a true seeker.

With a reverence that felt like a prayer, she walked over and picked it up. It was heavy. She carried it to the table, sat, and opened it. The family tree was inscribed on the frontispiece—names, births, deaths. She turned the thin, whispery pages of the Old Testament. Past Psalms, past Proverbs. Her fingers found a thickness. Pressed between the Book of Jeremiah and the Lamentations, a sheaf of papers, folded tight and flat.

Her heart hammered against her ribs. She carefully extracted them. They were not recipes. They were a timeline, in Agatha’s neatest hand. Dates. Witnessed conversations. Quotes from Lily, sourced to her sister, now deceased. A list of Reverend Finch’s previous parish, with a cryptic note about a “similar incident hushed up.” And at the bottom, a single, underlined sentence:

“The letters Lily kept are buried with her. In the locket she never took off. She told her sister it held her deepest secret. They never opened the locket at the inquest. They are still there.”

Eleanor Vance stared, the words blurring. The final stone. Not just a record of suspicion, but a literal map to the evidence. Agatha hadn’t just theorised; she had known where the proof was.

A soft, scraping sound came from the front of the cottage.

Not a knock. Not the wind.

It was the sound of a key, Agatha’s key, turning slowly in the lock.
