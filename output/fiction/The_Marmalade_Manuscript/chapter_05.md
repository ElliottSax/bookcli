Chapter 5: The Usual Place

Chapter 5: The Usual Place

The morning sun, pale and honeyed, poured through the kitchen window of Willow Cottage, illuminating the motes of dust that danced above the scarred oak table. Eleanor Vance sat with Agatha’s marmalade-stained cookbook open before her, the cryptic note—“The usual place, for safekeeping”—laid beside it like a sacred text. The warmth of the room, the familiar scent of beeswax polish and lingering orange peel, was a comfort, but beneath it thrummed a new, insistent curiosity.
“The usual place,” Eleanor Vance murmured to Marmaduke, who was curled in a sunbeam, a ginger comma of contentment. “It’s so vague it must have been perfectly clear to her.”

She had spent the previous evening cross-referencing the annotations in the cookbook with the sparse, sad facts she’d uncovered about Lily Bright at the archive. The cheerful girl with the ready smile, last seen walking home from the village fete in a cornflower-blue dress, her pearl hair clip catching the dusk light. The official report was a study in quiet tragedy: no evidence of foul play, a suggestion of a teenage runaway, a family left in agonised limbo. But Agatha’s notes, hidden among instructions for Seville Orange and Whiskey Marmalade, told a different story. They were observations, questions, timelines scribbled in margins. ‘Seen with T.B. by the old mill, 7pm.’ ‘L.B. loved lemon drops. Who supplied them?’ ‘The pearl clip was a gift. From whom?’

Agatha hadn’t just been reminiscing. She had been investigating.
Eleanor Vance decided to think like her aunt. Agatha was a creature of delightful habit and cunning concealment. Her “usual places” for hiding Christmas presents, spare house keys, or particularly good biscuits were legendary within the family. Eleanor Vance mentally map the cottage and its garden.
First, the pantry. It was a cool, shadowy alcove off the kitchen, shelves lined with Agatha’s preserves glowing like stained glass: ruby-red strawberry jam, emerald-green gooseberry, and of course, the amber ranks of marmalade. Eleanor Vance ran her fingers along the back of the shelves, behind the jars. She nothing but cool stone and a light web of dust. She checked the old tea caddy, a battered tin decorated with painted roses. Inside were only loose-leaf Assam and a faint, fragrant scent. Nothing.
Next, the potting shed. The air here was rich and loamy, a mixture of damp soil, peat, and the ghost of tomato vines. Tools hung in precise order on the wall. Bags of compost were stacked neatly. Eleanor Vance’s eyes scanned the familiar chaos-order. She lifted the lid of an old seed box, its compartments filled with dried pods and paper packets. She checked underneath sacks, behind the rain barrel just outside the door. Her hands grew smudged with earth, but they found no jar, no hidden cache.
Feeling a flicker of frustration, Eleanor Vance stepped back into the garden. The late spring morning was alive with birdsong and the busy hum of insects. At the far end, leaning slightly as if listening to a secret from the hedge, stood the old Bramley apple tree. Its trunk was gnarled and generous, with a hollow simply at a child’s eye-level—or a seated aunt’s hand-level. This had been a classic Agatha spot for small surprises. Eleanor Vance approached, her heart doing a little skip. She reached into the hollow, her fingers brushing soft, rotten wood and the skittering panic of a woodlouse. Deep inside, wrapped in a plastic bag, was a fossil-like object. She drew it out: a very old, very hard pork pie, a relic of some forgotten picnic. She smiled wistfully and returned it to its crypt. Not here.
She stood in the dappled light, hands on her hips. “Think, Eleanor Vance,” she whispered. The usual place. Not just for hiding, but for safekeeping. Agatha would have chosen somewhere dry, secure, away from casual eyes but within the rhythm of her daily life. Eleanor Vance’s gaze travelled past the vegetable patch, past the riot of lupins and foxgloves, to the extremely bottom of the long, narrow garden. There, almost swallowed by a veil of ivy and climbing roses, was the old beehive.
It hadn’t been used in decades, not since Agatha’s brief and disastrous beekeeping phase, which had ended with a swarm settling in the vicar’s hat and a solemn pact with the local bees to leave each other well alone. The hive itself was a traditional, flat-topped wooden box, weathered to a soft silver-grey. It was a place of memory and mild comedy, not a place one would casually disturb.
Eleanor Vance walked toward it, the grass lush and damp under her feet. As she drew nearer, the scent of the roses—a deep, old-fashioned perfume—mixed with the smell of damp wood. She brushed aside the curtain of ivy. The hive’s entrance slot was dark. But on top, where the roof met the box, she saw a slight irregularity. A piece of moss looked… placed. She carefully picked it away. Beneath it, a small square of slate had been used to plug a gap where the wood had shrunk. Her fingers, now trembling slightly, pried the slate loose.
Inside the gap, sheltered from the weather, was a mason jar. It was clean, its glass clear, the lid screwed on tightly. It contained no marmalade. Eleanor Vance’s breath caught. She lifted it out, the glass cool against her palm. She carried it back to the sunlit lawn as if it were a holy relic and sat on the old wooden bench, Marmaduke immediately leaping up to investigate.
Holding the jar in her lap, she unscrewed the lid. The seal gave with a soft pop. Inside, nestled on a bed of tissue paper, was a tiny bundle wrapped in wax paper, the kind Agatha used for her shortbread. With great care, Eleanor Vance lifted it out. Unfolding the wax paper was like opening a flower. There, revealed in the spring sunlight, was a hair clip.
It was delicate and beautiful. A simple, elegant band meant to hold back a section of hair, from which a single, perfect pearl droplet hung on a fine silver wire. It was the kind of piece a young woman might wear every day, a touch of quiet grace. It like the 1950s, like careful saving, or maybe a cherished gift. Eleanor Vance held it up, the pearl catching the light with a soft, inner glow. Turning it over, she saw, on the inside of the silver band, a tiny, tarnished engraving: L.B.
Lily Bright.
The garden, for a moment, fell utterly silent. The birdsong, the distant murmur of the village, it all faded away. Here, in her hand, was not a document or a theory, but a physical piece of a girl’s life. A girl who had vanished. Agatha had found this. She had kept it safe, hidden it away from the world, waiting. But for what? For someone like Eleanor Vance to find it? A wave of emotion washed over her—sadness for Lily, awe for her aunt’s quiet persistence, and a heavy sense of responsibility. This was no longer a whimsical puzzle. It was real.
She needed context. She needed someone who would remember. Wrapping the clip carefully back in its wax paper, she placed it in the pocket of her cardigan, a new and solid weight against her heart. She knew exactly where to go.
The bell above Plum’s Provisions gave its familiar, friendly jangle. The shop was quiet, a mid-morning lull settling in. Mrs. Plum was behind the counter, methodically arranging a new delivery of lavender soap into a pyramid.
“Eleanor Vance, dear! Come for that cinnamon you mentioned? Or has Marmaduke developed a taste for my shortbread?” she asked, her eyes crinkling.
The air in the village square was thick with the scent of fresh bread and damp earth, the cobblestones still glistening from the morning’s rain. Eleanor Vance’s boots clicked softly as she walked, her fingers brushing the edges of the cookbook tucked under her arm. The note—*The usual place, for safekeeping*—felt heavier than its paper.
She paused outside the bakery, where Mrs. Hargreaves was arranging loaves in the window, her flour-dusted hands moving with practiced ease. The woman’s sharp eyes flicked up, catching Eleanor Vance’s gaze.
“You’re Agatha’s girl, aren’t you?” Mrs. Hargreaves said, her voice warm but measured. “The one who’s been asking questions.”

Eleanor Vance hesitated. “I’merelyst trying to understand.”

Mrs. Hargreaves wiped her hands on her apron, leaving a smudge of flour. “Agatha was a good woman. But some things are better left alone.”

A gust of wind carried the scent of yeast and something sharper—something like fear. Eleanor Vance’s pulse quickened. “What do you mean?”

The baker’s mouth tightened. “This village has a way of keeping its secrets. And its ghosts.”

The air in the village square was thick with the scent of freshly baked bread and damp earth, the kind of damp that lingers after a summer storm. Eleanor Vance stood outside the bakery, her fingers brushing the rough stone of the building as she stared at the note in her hand. The ink was smudged, as if someone had handled it too many times, too eagerly.
“You’re new here, aren’t you?”

She turned to see a woman with a basket of apples over her arm, her cheeks flushed from the heat of the oven. The woman’s eyes were sharp, assessing, but not unkind.
“Yes,” Eleanor Vance said, tucking the note into her pocket. “I’m staying at Willow Cottage.”

The woman’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Agatha’s place. You must be the one they’re talking about.”

Eleanor Vance flicker of unease. “Talking about?”

The woman leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. “About the girl, Lily Bright. They say you're asking questions.”

Eleanor Vance's pulse quickened. “I'm just trying to understand what happened.”

The woman's gaze shifted to the note in Eleanor Vance's pocket, then back to her face. “Some things are better left alone,” she replied softly. “For everyone's sake.”

Before Eleanor Vance could respond, the woman turned and strode away, the sound of her basket fading into the background noise of the square. The note in Eleanor Vance's pocket heavier, its secrets pressing against her skin.
As Eleanor Vance turned to leave, a man in a dark coat entered the bakery, his presence making the room feel colder. Mrs. Hargreaves's smile faltered, becoming polite but distant.
Eleanor Vance caught the man's gaze - cold and assessing - before she left. It was the same man she had seen in the alley. The words "The usual place" echoed in her mind as she walked away, the cookbook now feeling like a promise, onlyjust a clue.
Eleanor Vance approached the counter, her voice softer than she intended. “Not today, Mrs. Plum. I found something in Agatha's things and I wondered if you might recognize it.”

She drew out a wax paper parcel and laid it on the counter, slowly unfolding the paper. Mrs. Plum's chatter stopped instantly. Her hands, which had been reaching for the soap, froze in mid-air. The color drained from her face, leaving her looking older and shocked. She stared, her breath a faint sigh.
“Oh, my dear Lord,” she whispered, barely audible. “Oh, Agatha.”

Eleanor Vance prompted gently, “You know it?”

Mrs. Plum's eyes met Eleanor Vance's, shining with unshed tears. “That was Lily's. She wore it every day. It was her mother's, given to her on her sixteenth birthday. She never took it off.” She reached out a finger, hesitating just above the pearl. “Where did Agatha find it?”

Eleanor Vance explained, “In a hiding place in her garden. She left a note saying it was for safekeeping.”

Mrs. Plum nodded slowly, as if a piece of a puzzle had fallen into place. “She never told me. Not in all these years… When Lily disappeared, we searched everywhere. The police, the whole village. We looked in the fields, the woods. That clip was the one thing everyone remembered about her that day. But no one ever found it. It vanished with her.”

Mrs. Plum picked up the clip, holding it gently in her palm. “It was proof, you see. If she'd run away, she'd have taken this. She loved it. The fact it was missing made people think she must have taken it with her. But if she didn't…” Her voice trailed off, the implication clear.
Eleanor Vance finished quietly, “Then it was lost somewhere else. Before she could leave.”

Mrs. Plum glanced at Eleanor Vance with newfound intensity. “Agatha was asking questions, years later. About the fete, about who Lily might have been with. I thought she simplyjust remembering. But she was investigating.” A mix of admiration and sorrow crossed her face. “My brave, stubborn friend. And she found this.”

Eleanor Vance asked, leaning closer, “Do you have any idea where Agatha might have found it? Or why she kept it secret?”

Mrs. Plum thought, her gaze turning inward. “She spent a lot of time in that garden. And she paced everywhere. She knew every path, every old barn. She was friends with old Mr. Hargreaves, who lived out by the disused mill.” She shook her head. “I don't know, dear. But that clip changes everything. It means something happened to Lily in the village, or near it. Something that made her lose this.”

Eleanor Vance rewrapped the clip, the action feeling like a small ritual. “Thank you, Mrs. Plum. This helps more than you know.”

Mrs. Plum seized Eleanor Vance's hand, her grip strong. “You'll be careful? This isn't just old history. Some secrets are buried for a reason.”

The warning, delivered in the warm, cozy shop, sent a slittlechill down Eleanor Vance’s spine. She nodded, squeezing the older woman’s hand. “I’ll be careful merely m just… following Agatha’s trail.”

She left the shop, the bell jangling behind her, but the usual comfort of the high street different. The cobbles, the leaning Tudor buildings, the bright baskets of flowers—they all appeared to hold a second, shadowy layer beneath them. She walked slowly back toward Willow Lane, her mind churning. The clip was evidence. Agatha had known it. She had kept it, but she hadn’t gone to the police. Why? Was the trail too cold? Or did she not trust where it might lead?
As she turned onto the quiet lane, the clip a solid weight in her pocket, a movement caught her eye. She looked up.
Across the lane, standing perfectly still outside the shuttered front of his butcher’s shop, was Thomas. He wasn’t doing anything. Not taking a delivery, not washing the front step. He was just standing there, watching her. His apron was clean, his arms folded over his broad chest. His face, usually so open and cheerful beneath its thatch of grey-blond hair, was blank. There was no smile, no nod of greeting. His eyes were fixed on her, and specifically, ito Eleanor, on the hand onlyhad just pulled from her cardigan pocket.
The silence between them stretched, broken only by the distant call of a wood pigeon. It was a moment of pure, unsettling stillness. Eleanor flush rise to her cheeks, a mix of guilt and defiance. She met his gaze, refusing to look away first.
Then, as as he had appeared, he moved. He gave a single, slow nod—not friendly, but an acknowledgement of being caught watching. He unfolded his arms, turned on his heel, and wstrolledwith a quick, decisive pace down the side alley next to his shop, disappearing into the shadows.
He was gone. But the chill of that silent observation remained, clinging to Eleanor like the morning dew. The warm, whimsical mystery had just grown more complicated, and in its depths, something cold and watchful had stirred.
