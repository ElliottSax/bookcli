Chapter 5: The Usual Place

Chapter 5: The Usual Place

The morning sun, pale and honeyed, poured through the kitchen window of Willow Cottage, illuminating the motes of dust that danced above the scarred oak table. Eleanor sat with Agatha’s marmalade-stained cookbook open before her, the cryptic note—“The usual place, for safekeeping”—laid beside it like a sacred text. The warmth of the room, the familiar scent of beeswax polish and lingering orange peel, was a comfort, but beneath it thrummed a new, insistent curiosity.

“The usual place,” Eleanor murmured to Marmaduke, who was curled in a sunbeam, a ginger comma of contentment. “It’s so vague it must have been perfectly clear to her.”

She had spent the previous evening cross-referencing the annotations in the cookbook with the sparse, sad facts she’d uncovered about Lily Bright at the archive. The cheerful girl with the ready smile, last seen walking home from the village fete in a cornflower-blue dress, her pearl hair clip catching the dusk light. The official report was a study in quiet tragedy: no evidence of foul play, a suggestion of a teenage runaway, a family left in agonised limbo. But Agatha’s notes, hidden amongst instructions for Seville Orange and Whiskey Marmalade, told a different story. They were observations, questions, timelines scribbled in margins. ‘Seen with T.B. by the old mill, 7pm.’ ‘L.B. loved lemon drops. Who supplied them?’ ‘The pearl clip was a gift. From whom?’

Agatha hadn’t just been reminiscing. She had been investigating.

Eleanor decided to think like her aunt. Agatha was a creature of delightful habit and cunning concealment. Her “usual places” for hiding Christmas presents, spare house keys, or particularly good biscuits were legendary within the family. Eleanor began to mentally map the cottage and its garden.

First, the pantry. It was a cool, shadowy alcove off the kitchen, shelves lined with Agatha’s preserves glowing like stained glass: ruby-red strawberry jam, emerald-green gooseberry, and of course, the amber ranks of marmalade. Eleanor ran her fingers along the back of the shelves, behind the jars. She felt nothing but cool stone and a light web of dust. She checked the old tea caddy, a battered tin decorated with painted roses. Inside were only loose-leaf Assam and a faint, fragrant scent. Nothing.

Next, the potting shed. The air here was rich and loamy, a mixture of damp soil, peat, and the ghost of tomato vines. Tools hung in precise order on the wall. Bags of compost were stacked neatly. Eleanor’s eyes scanned the familiar chaos-order. She lifted the lid of an old seed box, its compartments filled with dried pods and paper packets. She checked underneath sacks, behind the rain barrel just outside the door. Her hands grew smudged with earth, but they found no jar, no hidden cache.

Feeling a flicker of frustration, Eleanor stepped back into the garden. The late spring morning was alive with birdsong and the busy hum of insects. At the far end, leaning slightly as if listening to a secret from the hedge, stood the old Bramley apple tree. Its trunk was gnarled and generous, with a hollow just at a child’s eye-level—or a seated aunt’s hand-level. This had been a classic Agatha spot for small surprises. Eleanor approached, her heart doing a little skip. She reached into the hollow, her fingers brushing soft, rotten wood and the skittering panic of a woodlouse. Deep inside, wrapped in a plastic bag, was a fossil-like object. She drew it out: a very old, very hard pork pie, a relic of some forgotten picnic. She smiled wistfully and returned it to its crypt. Not here.

She stood in the dappled light, hands on her hips. “Think, Eleanor,” she whispered. The usual place. Not just for hiding, but for safekeeping. Agatha would have chosen somewhere dry, secure, away from casual eyes but within the rhythm of her daily life. Eleanor’s gaze travelled past the vegetable patch, past the riot of lupins and foxgloves, to the very bottom of the long, narrow garden. There, almost swallowed by a veil of ivy and climbing roses, was the old beehive.

It hadn’t been used in decades, not since Agatha’s brief and disastrous beekeeping phase, which had ended with a swarm settling in the vicar’s hat and a solemn pact with the local bees to leave each other well alone. The hive itself was a traditional, flat-topped wooden box, weathered to a soft silver-grey. It was a place of memory and mild comedy, not a place one would casually disturb.

Eleanor walked towards it, the grass lush and damp under her feet. As she drew nearer, the scent of the roses—a deep, old-fashioned perfume—mingled with the smell of damp wood. She brushed aside the curtain of ivy. The hive’s entrance slot was dark. But on top, where the roof met the box, she saw a slight irregularity. A piece of moss looked… placed. She carefully picked it away. Beneath it, a small, square of slate had been used to plug a gap where the wood had shrunk. Her fingers, now trembling slightly, pried the slate loose.

Inside the gap, sheltered from the elements, was a mason jar. It was clean, its glass clear, its lid screwed on tightly. It contained no marmalade. Eleanor’s breath caught. She lifted it out, the glass cool against her palm. She carried it back to the sunlit lawn as if it were a holy relic and sat on the old wooden bench, Marmaduke immediately leaping up to investigate.

Holding the jar in her lap, she unscrewed the lid. The seal gave with a soft pop. Inside, nestled on a bed of tissue paper, was a small bundle wrapped in wax paper, the kind Agatha used for her shortbread. With infinite care, Eleanor lifted it out. Unfolding the wax paper was like opening a flower. There, revealed in the spring sunlight, was a hair clip.

It was delicate, beautiful. A simple, elegant band meant to hold back a section of hair, from which a single, perfect pearl droplet was suspended on a fine silver wire. It was the kind of piece a young woman might wear every day, a touch of understated grace. It spoke of the 1950s, of careful saving, or perhaps a cherished gift. Eleanor held it up, the pearl catching the light with a soft, inner glow. Turning it over, she saw, on the inside of the silver band, a tiny, tarnished engraving: L.B.

Lily Bright.

The garden, for a moment, fell utterly silent. The birdsong, the distant murmur of the village, it all receded. Here, in her hand, was not a document or a theory, but a physical piece of a girl’s life. A girl who had vanished. Agatha had found this. She had kept it safe, hidden it away from the world, waiting. But for what? For someone like Eleanor to find it? A wave of emotion, profound and complex, washed over her—sadness for Lily, awe for her aunt’s quiet persistence, and a heavy sense of responsibility. This was no longer a whimsical puzzle. It was real.

She needed context. She needed someone who would remember. Wrapping the clip carefully back in its wax paper, she placed it in the pocket of her cardigan, a new weight against her heart. She knew exactly where to go.

The bell above Plum’s Provisions gave its familiar, friendly jangle. The shop was quiet, mid-morning lull settling in. Mrs. Plum was behind the counter, methodically arranging a new delivery of lavender soap into a pyramid.

“Eleanor, dear! Come for that cinnamon you mentioned? Or has Marmaduke developed a taste for my shortbread?” she asked, her eyes crinkling.

“Not today, Mrs. Plum,” Eleanor said, her voice softer than she intended. She approached the counter. The warm, comforting smells of the shop—coffee, soap, dried fruit—usually so soothing, now felt like a backdrop to something more serious. “I… I found something. In Agatha’s things. I wondered if you might recognise it.”

She drew the wax paper parcel from her pocket and laid it on the counter between the tower of soap and a basket of free-range eggs. Slowly, she unfolded the paper.

Mrs. Plum’s chatter died instantly. Her hands, which had been fluttering towards the soap, stilled in mid-air. All the colour seemed to drain from her kindly face, leaving her looking suddenly older, her wrinkles deepening into grooves of shock. She didn’t reach for the clip. She simply stared, her breath a faint, shaky sigh.

“Oh, my dear Lord,” she whispered, the words barely audible. “Oh, Agatha.”

“You know it?” Eleanor prompted gently.

“Know it?” Mrs. Plum’s eyes finally lifted to meet Eleanor’s, and they were bright with unshed tears. “That was Lily’s. Lily Bright’s. She wore it every day. It was her mother’s, you see. Given to her on her sixteenth birthday. She was never without it.” She reached out a finger, her touch hovering just above the pearl, not quite daring to make contact. “Where… where did Agatha find it?”

“In a hiding place. In her garden,” Eleanor said. “She left a note. ‘For safekeeping.’”

Mrs. Plum nodded slowly, as if a terrible piece of a puzzle had just slotted into place. “She never said a word. Not to me. All these years…” She blinked rapidly. “When Lily disappeared, everyone searched. The police, the whole village. We combed the fields, the woods. That clip… it was the one thing everyone remembered about her that day. ‘She’ll have that pearl clip in her hair,’ her mother kept saying. ‘You’ll see it shining.’ But no one ever did. It vanished with her.”

She finally picked up the clip, holding it in her work-roughened palm as if it were a fledgling bird. “It was the proof, you see. If she’d run away, she’d have taken this. She loved it so. The fact it was missing… it made people think she must have taken it with her. But if she didn’t…” Mrs. Plum’s voice trailed off, the implication hanging heavy in the scented air.

“If she didn’t,” Eleanor finished quietly, “then it was lost… elsewhere. Before she could leave.”

Mrs. Plum looked at Eleanor with a new, intense focus. “Agatha was asking questions, years later. Casual-like. About the fete, about who Lily might have been walking with. I thought she was just… remembering. We all tried not to think about it, it was too sad. But she was digging.” A mix of admiration and sorrow crossed her face. “My brave, stubborn friend. And she found this*.”

“Do you have any idea,” Eleanor asked, leaning closer, “where Agatha might have found it? Or why she kept it secret?”

Mrs. Plum thought, her gaze turning inward, travelling back across decades. “She was always in that garden. And she used to walk… everywhere. Knew every footpath, every old barn. She was friends with old Mr. Hargreaves, who lived out by the disused mill. He died, oh, must be twenty years back now.” She shook her head. “I don’t know, dear. But that clip… it changes the story, doesn’t it? It means something happened to her in the village, or near it. Something that made this come off.”

Eleanor rewrapped the clip, the simple action feeling like a ritual. “Thank you, Mrs. Plum. This helps more than you know.”

“You’ll be careful?” Mrs. Plum said, suddenly seizing Eleanor’s hand. Her grip was surprisingly strong. “This isn’t just old history. Some secrets… the earth holds onto them for a reason.”

The warning, delivered in the warm, cozy shop, sent a small chill down Eleanor’s spine. She nodded, squeezing the older woman’s hand in return. “I’ll be careful. I’m just… following Agatha’s trail.”

She left the shop, the bell jangling behind her, but the usual comfort of the high street felt different. The cobbles, the leaning Tudor buildings, the bright baskets of flowers—they all seemed to hold a second, shadowy layer beneath them. She walked slowly back towards Willow Lane, her mind churning. The clip was evidence. Agatha had known it. She had preserved it, but she hadn’t gone to the police. Why? Was it because the trail was too cold? Or because she didn’t trust where it might lead?

As she turned onto the quiet lane, the clip a palpable presence in her pocket, a movement caught her eye. She looked up.

Across the lane, standing perfectly still outside the shuttered front of his butcher’s shop, was Thomas. He wasn’t doing anything. Not taking a delivery, not washing the front step. He was just standing, watching her. His apron was clean, his arms folded over his broad chest. His face, usually so open and cheerful beneath its thatch of grey-blond hair, was utterly unreadable. There was no smile, no nod of greeting. His eyes were fixed on her, and specifically, it seemed to Eleanor, on the hand she had just withdrawn from her cardigan pocket.

The silence between them stretched, broken only by the distant call of a wood pigeon. It was a tableau of pure, unsettling stillness. Eleanor felt a flush rise to her cheeks, a mixture of guilt and defiance. She met his gaze, unwilling to look away first.

Then, as suddenly as he had appeared, he moved. He gave a single, slow nod—not friendly, but an acknowledgement of being seen seeing. He unfolded his arms, turned on his heel, and walked with a quick, decisive pace down the side alley next to his shop, disappearing into the shadows.

He was gone. But the chill of that silent observation remained, clinging to Eleanor like the morning dew. The warm, whimsical mystery had just deepened, and in its depths, something cold and watchful had stirred.
