Here is the expanded chapter:

1923, that she found the answer. A small, unassuming notice tucked between the church fete results and the obituaries:

"The Vicarage welcomes the Rev. Victor Vane, newly appointed to our parish. Rev. Vane, a scholar of medieval history and a keen gardener, will be taking over the spiritual and pastoral duties from the retiring Rev. Hargreaves. A welcome tea will be held in his honour at the village hall on the 14th of this month."

Eleanor Vance’s fingers tightened around the page. Victor Vane. V.V. The initials matched. But why would a vicar’s recipe be hidden in Agatha’s cookbook? And why would someone break into the cottage to find it?

She needed to talk to someone. But who? The village was a closed circle, and she was still an outsider. The only person she trusted was Agatha, and Agatha was gone.

Then she remembered the letter. The one she’d found in the biscuit tin, the one that had led her to the cottage in the first place. It had been addressed to her, but it had been written by someone else. Someone who knew her name before she even knew it herself.

She pulled the letter from the drawer where she’d kept it, the paper soft with age. The handwriting was elegant, slanted, the ink faded but still legible. It read:

"Dear Eleanor Vance,

If you are reading this, then I have gone. The truth about your mother, about your father, and about the choices I made remains. There are things to understand, things that will help you make sense of the past. I have left you clues in the places only you would think to look. Follow them, and you will find the answers you seek. But be careful, my dear. Some secrets are best left buried. Trust no one, not even those who seem kindest.

Yours always,

Agatha Vance"

Eleanor Vance’s hands trembled as she read the words again. The letter was a puzzle, a map to something she didn’t yet understand. And now, with the discovery of V.V.’s recipe, she had another piece to add to the puzzle.

She looked out the window, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the garden. The cottage felt different now, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath, waiting for her to uncover the truth.

She had to find out more about Victor Vane.

The village library was a small, quiet space tucked away in a corner of the village hall. The air smelled of old paper and polish, and the shelves were lined with books that had been loved and read by generations of villagers. Eleanor Vance approached the librarian, a woman with silver hair and a warm smile.

"Can I help you, dear?" the woman asked, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

"I’m looking for information about a former vicar of St. Botolph’s," Eleanor Vance said, her voice barely above a whisper. "His name was Victor Vane. He was here in the 1920s."

The librarian’s smile faltered, and she looked away, her eyes scanning the shelves as if searching for a book that wasn’t there. "Ah, yes. Rev. Vane. He was here for a short time, wasn’t he?" she said, her voice hesitant.

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. The librarian disappeared into a back room, and Eleanor Vance took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing thoughts.

The librarian returned, carrying a small, leather-bound book. "This is the parish register from that time," she said, her voice soft. "It might have some information about Rev. Vane."

Eleanor Vance took the book with trembling hands and opened it to the page marked with a ribbon. The entries were written in a neat, precise hand, and she scanned the names until she found what she was looking for.

"Rev. Victor Vane, appointed to St. Botolph’s Parish, December 1923. Left the parish in June 1924. No reason given."

Eleanor Vance’s heart sank. That was all? No reason given? It was as if Victor Vane had simply vanished from the village, leaving no trace behind.

She turned the page, and her eyes fell on an entry that made her breath catch in her throat.

"Eleanor Vance Vane, daughter of Rev. Victor Vane and his wife, Margaret, baptised on the 12th of March 1924."

Eleanor Vance’s hands shook as she read the words again. Eleanor Vance Vane. That was her name. Her real name. The name she had been given at birth.

She looked up at the librarian, her eyes wide with shock. "This says that I was baptised here," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "That I was the daughter of Rev. Victor Vane."

The librarian’s face paled, and she took a step back, her eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I—I didn’t know that," she stammered. "I thought you were just visiting the cottage. I didn’t realise you were—"

Eleanor Vance didn’t wait to hear the rest. She turned and hurried out of the library, her mind racing.

The village was quiet outside, the only sound the chirping of birds in the trees. Eleanor Vance walked swiftly, her heart pounding in her chest.

The vicarage was a large, imposing building, its stone walls covered in ivy and its windows gleaming in the late afternoon sun. Eleanor Vance hesitated for a moment before knocking on the door.

The door was opened by a young woman with a kind face and a warm smile. "Can I help you?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

"I’m looking for information about a former vicar of St. Botolph’s," Eleanor Vance said, her voice firm. "His name was Victor Vane. He was here in the 1923."

The woman’s smile faltered, and she looked away, her eyes scanning the hallway as if searching for a distraction. "I’m afraid I don’t know much about him," she said, her voice hesitant. "But you could try speaking to the current vicar. He might be able to help you."

Eleanor Vance thanked the woman and made her way to the vicar’s study. The door was open, and she could see a man sitting at a desk, his head bent over a book. He looked up, his eyes widening in surprise.

"Can I help you?" he asked, his voice deep and resonant.

"I’m looking for information about a former vicar of St. Botolph’s," Eleanor Vance said, her voice steady. "His name was Victor Vane. He was here in the 1923."

The vicar’s face paled, and he closed the book he was reading. "I’m afraid I don’t know much about him," he said, his voice hesitant. "But I can tell you that he was a good man. A kind and gentle soul."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes narrowed. "What do you mean?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar looked up, his eyes meeting hers. "I mean that he was a man of great faith," he said. "A man who believed in the power of love and forgiveness. He was a good vicar, and he will be deeply missed."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes searched the vicar’s face, looking for any sign of deception. But all she saw was kindness and sincerity. She nodded, her mind racing.

"Can I speak to you for a moment?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Of course," he said.

Eleanor Vance took a deep breath and sat down in the chair opposite the vicar’s desk. "I must learn more about my parents," she said, her voice steady. "About the life I was born into."

The vicar looked at her, his eyes filled with compassion. "I can tell you what I know," he said. "But I must warn you, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me everything," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "Let us begin."

As the vicar began to speak, Eleanor Vance listened, her heart pounding in her chest. The words poured out of his mouth like a river, a mix of sorrow and regret, of love and loss.

At first, the vicar spoke of Victor Vane’s time at St. Botolph’s, of his dedication to his parishioners and his passion for his work. But as the conversation went on, the vicar’s tone changed, and he spoke of a darker time, a time of great turmoil and upheaval.

"It was a difficult period," the vicar said, his voice low and serious. "A time when the church was facing great challenges, and the community was torn apart by conflict and division. Victor Vane was a strong leader, but even he was not immune to the struggles of the time."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes narrowed, her mind racing with questions. "What happened?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "Please," she said, her voice firm. "I need to know the truth."

The vicar took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "But be warned, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Victor Vane was involved in a scandal," he said, his voice low and serious. "A scandal that shook the very foundations of the church. He was accused of misconduct, of behaving in a way that was unbecoming of a man of the cloth."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, her mind racing with questions. "What kind of misconduct?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "Please," she said, her voice firm. "I need to know the truth."

The vicar took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "But be warned, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Victor Vane was accused of having an affair with a woman in the parish," he said, his voice low and serious. "A woman who was not his wife."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, her mind racing with questions. "Who was she?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "Please," she said, her voice firm. "I need to know the truth."

The vicar took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "But be warned, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "The woman was Margaret," he said, his voice low and serious. "Victor Vane’s wife."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, her mind racing with questions. "What happened?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "Please," she said, her voice firm. "I need to know the truth."

The vicar took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "But be warned, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Margaret and Victor Vane’s marriage was a sham," he said, his voice low and serious. "A marriage of convenience, entered into for the sake of appearances."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, her mind racing with questions. "What do you mean?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I mean that Margaret was not Victor Vane’s wife in the classical sense," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "She was a woman of great beauty and intelligence, but she was also a woman of great cunning and ambition."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes narrowed, her mind racing with questions. "What happened to her?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "Please," she said, her voice firm. "I need to know the truth."

The vicar took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "But be warned, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Margaret and Victor Vane’s marriage ended in tragedy," he said, his voice low and serious. "A tragedy that shook the very foundations of the church."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, her mind racing with questions. "What happened?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "Please," she said, her voice firm. "I need to know the truth."

The vicar took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "But be warned, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Margaret died under mysterious circumstances," he said, his voice low and serious. "Circumstances that were never fully explained."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, her mind racing with questions. "What do you mean?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I mean that Margaret’s death was a tragic event," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "An event that had far-reaching consequences for the church and the community."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes narrowed, her mind racing with questions. "What happened to Victor Vane?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "Please," she said, her voice firm. "I need to know the truth."

The vicar took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "But be warned, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Victor Vane was never seen again," he said, his voice low and serious. "His disappearance was a mystery that was never fully explained."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, her mind racing with questions. "What do you mean?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I mean that Victor Vane’s disappearance was a tragic event," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "An event that had far-reaching consequences for the church and the community."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes narrowed, her mind racing with questions. "What happened to my mother?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "Please," she said, her voice firm. "I need to know the truth."

The vicar took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well," he said. "But be warned, the truth may be difficult to hear."

Eleanor Vance nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She was ready to face whatever the truth might bring.

"Tell me," she said, her voice firm.

The vicar nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. "Your mother was a victim of circumstance," he said, his voice low and serious. "A victim of the tragic events that unfolded in the church."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes widened, her mind racing with questions. "What do you mean?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I mean that your mother was caught up in the events that led to Victor Vane’s disappearance," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Events that had far-reaching consequences for the church and the community."

Eleanor Vance’s eyes narrowed, her mind racing with questions. "What happened to her?" she asked, her voice firm.

The vicar hesitated, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "I’m not sure I should say," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Eleanor Vance leaned forward, her eyes locked on the vicar’s. "
