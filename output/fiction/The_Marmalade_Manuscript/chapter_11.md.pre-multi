Chapter 11: The Last Jar

Chapter 11: The Last Jar

The morning after Thomas’s confession, the world of Pockets Hollow had shifted on its axis for Eleanor. The dew on the cobbles seemed to hold the sheen of old tears; the cheerful clatter from the bakery felt like a performance put on for an audience determined to ignore the cracks in the scenery. She carried Thomas’s secret like a live coal in her pocket, its heat both a comfort and a danger. Agatha’s theory was no longer a whimsical puzzle. It was a truth, witnessed and buried for decades.

She knew the next step had to be the final piece—Agatha’s conclusive evidence. But the village, sensing a disturbance in its tranquil ecosystem, was beginning to react. Eleanor felt it in the slightly-too-long pauses in conversation at the post office, in the way certain curtains twitched as she passed. The collective memory of Pockets Hollow was stirring, and it was wary.

Her path to the greengrocer was intercepted by the solid, blue-clad form of Constable Wells. He stood under the awning of the hardware store, a pint of milk in one hand, his expression one of paternal concern etched with official impatience.

“Miss Eleanor,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “A word.”

“Constable,” she nodded, her heart beginning a steady, anxious rhythm.

He shifted his weight, his boots scraping on the stone. “I’ve had a chat with young Thomas Blythe,” he began, watching her face. “He’s in a state. Told me some old, muddled story about things he thought he saw as a bairn. Upset his mother terribly. Then he mentioned he’d been talking to you about… historical matters.”

Eleanor met his gaze. “He shared a memory. A painful one.”

“A child’s memory, from over sixty years ago,” Wells said, his tone softening into caution. “Fragile things, those. Easily shaped by suggestion. By… interesting theories found in old notebooks.” He took a step closer, lowering his voice. “I’m asking you, as a friend to the village, to let this rest. You’re stirring up silt in a pond that’s been clear for a long time. The Reverend Croft was a good man. A pillar. Whatever Agatha Merryweather was chasing, it was a fantasy born of grief. She lost her friend. It twisted her thinking.”

“And Thomas’s memory?” Eleanor asked quietly.

“A child, confused by the dark, by adult tensions he couldn’t understand,” Wells said with finality. “I’ve seen the file—what little there is. Lily Swann left of her own accord. It happens. This… this wolf in shepherd’s clothing notion… it’s a harmful fantasy. Drop it, Eleanor. For your sake, and for the peace of everyone here.”

He gave her a firm, meaningful look, hefted his milk, and walked away. The dismissal was clear. The official line was drawn. To cross it would be to make herself an outsider, a nuisance, a purveyor of harmful fantasies.

The weight of his words pressed on her all the way back to Marmalade Cottage. The cozy sitting room, with Agatha’s notebooks spread like a patchwork quilt of suspicion on the floor, felt suddenly fragile. Was she, too, building castles out of cobwebs? She picked up the final, unfinished notebook, its spine cracked, its pages smelling of dust and dried rosemary.

They will call it a fantasy, Agatha had written on the last legible page. They will protect the story because the truth is too ugly to fit into the village frame. But a story that ignores a missing girl is no story at all. It is a lie we tell ourselves over tea.

Eleanor traced the words with her finger. Agatha had anticipated this very moment. She had known her evidence had to be irrefutable, concrete. Not just theory, but proof.

She turned back to the cookbooks. They had been the map so far. The final answer, she felt sure, must be hidden in their culinary code. She began with the last one Agatha had used, the hefty Compendium of Country Jams & Conserves. She flipped past quince and medlar, past rosehip and rowan, her eyes scanning not the recipes but the margins, the notes, the stains.

And then she found it. A recipe near the back, written in Agatha’s later, shakier hand on a slip of paper and glued in place. The title made Eleanor’s breath catch: “Blackberry & Apple Silence.”

Not ‘Jam’. Silence.

The recipe was bizarre. The quantities were off—too much sugar, a puzzling pinch of salt. The instructions were cryptic: “Combine in the deepest bowl. Stir not clockwise, but with the memory of the river’s flow. Let it rest in the cold dark, where the echoes settle. The setting is key—not in light, but in shadow. Seek the binder of words, not food. Hymn number 142.”

Eleanor read it three times. Her pulse thrummed in her ears. This was no recipe. It was a set of directions. The deepest bowl—the font? The river? The cold dark where echoes settle… the church? The binder of words, not food. Hymn number 142.

The vestry. It had to be. The church vestry was cold, dark, and full of books—binders of words. Hymnals.

She needed to get into the vestry. And she needed a lookout.

There was only one person she could ask.

Mrs. Plum answered her knock still wearing her baking apron, dusted with flour like a light snowfall. Her keen eyes took in Eleanor’s tense expression.

“You’ve found something else,” she stated, wiping her hands.

“I think so. I need to look in the church vestry. And I need you to keep watch.”

A long silence followed. Mrs. Plum looked past Eleanor, towards the steeple visible over the rooftops. She was weighing loyalty to the institution against loyalty to her oldest friend. Finally, she gave a sharp nod. “Vicar’s gone to a deanery meeting in Malvern. Won’t be back until four. Mrs. Honeychurch, the cleaner, does the flowers on Thursday afternoons. She’s half-deaf and sings hymns at the top of her voice. We’ve got a window.”

“Constable Wells warned me off,” Eleanor confessed.

“Humph,” Mrs. Plum sniffed, untying her apron. “Ted Wells polishes the same village plaque every day and thinks it’s detective work. Agatha trusted you with this. That’s good enough for me. Let me get my hat.”

The walk to St. Botolph’s was tense. The churchyard was peaceful, dappled in afternoon sun, bees busy in the clover. The grandeur of the building felt imposing now, its stone façade holding secrets in its pores. Mrs. Plum took up a position on a bench by a yew tree, a small sketchbook in her hand, playing the part of a lady capturing the architecture. She gave Eleanor a barely perceptible nod.

The heavy oak door groaned as Eleanor slipped inside. The interior was cool and still, smelling of wax, old stone, and faintly, of lilies. Light streamed through the stained glass, painting the nave in pools of ruby and sapphire. She moved quickly, her soft-soled shoes whispering on the flagstones, past the pews where generations had sat, past the pulpit where Reverend Alban Croft had preached kindness and charity.

A small, arched door to the side of the chancel led to the vestry. It was unlocked. The room was small, crowded with a wardrobe for robes, a cluttered desk, and shelves of theological books and piles of parish magazines. It was indeed cold, and dark, the only light a narrow window of clear glass high up. The air smelled of mothballs and damp paper.

Hymn number 142.

Her eyes scanned the shelves. There were several old hymnals, their spines cracked. She found a stack of the Ancient & Modern edition that would have been used in the 1950s. Her hands trembled as she pulled it out. It was heavy, the red cloth cover faded to a dull pink. She opened it to number 142: “For All the Saints.”

The pages were thin, slightly foxed. She fanned them carefully. Nothing. She turned the book over, examining the spine. Then, behind where the hymnal had been, tucked flat against the back of the shelf, she saw it: a long, cream-coloured envelope, gone brittle with age.

She slid it out. It was unsealed. Written on the front in Agatha’s unmistakable, firm script was: “For the Truth. To be opened only when the wolf is named.”

Eleanor leaned against the cold wall, the envelope feeling like the most significant object she had ever held. She carefully extracted the contents: several sheets of crisp, typewritten paper, and a smaller, tissue-wrapped parcel.

The statement was dated October 15th, 1957. It was headed: ‘A Statement of Fact and Suspicion Regarding the Disappearance of Lily Swann, by Agatha J. Merryweather.’

It was not a frantic note. It was a calm, meticulous, and devastating document. Agatha detailed Lily’s growing fear, her allusions to a powerful admirer whose attentions had become a cage. She named no one directly, referring only to ‘a person of spiritual authority,’ but the description of his mannerisms, his voice, his particular turns of phrase, could only be Alban Croft.

Then came the thunderclap. Agatha wrote that on the morning after Lily vanished, before the police were called, she had gone down to the riverbank, to their favourite spot. There, caught in the roots of the old willow, she had found it: Lily’s pearl hair clip.

“I knew if I gave it to the police,” Agatha typed, the keys seeming to strike the page with force even now, “their search would focus on the river. They would declare it an accident or a tragedy of her own making. The true predator would be safe, hidden behind his collar. So I kept it. I withheld evidence. It is my great sin, and my only hope. For this clip did not fall into the water. It was torn free. And a few feet away, on the soft mud, was the clear impression of a man’s shoe, and beside it, a smaller, deeper mark, as if something heavy had been set down.”

Eleanor’s vision blurred. She could see it: the frantic struggle, the clip snapping, flying into the dark water. The heavy thing… a suitcase? A weight?

With trembling fingers, she unwrapped the tissue paper. Nestled inside was the hair clip. It was just as Thomas had described: a simple, elegant band, with a single, perfect pearl at its centre. One of the metal prongs was bent violently outward.

The statement concluded with two witness signatures, dated the same day in 1957. Eleanor’s breath caught. They were from Elara Finch, the sharp-eyed postmistress, and from Dr. Samuel Abbott. They had known. They had believed Agatha enough to put their names to this. They had kept this silent vigil for decades.

Here it was. Not a fantasy. A signed, witnessed testament, and the material proof. The final jar of marmalade, preserving not fruit, but a terrible, enduring truth.

The vestry door creaked open.

Eleanor started, clutching the papers to her chest. Framed in the doorway was the Reverend Michael Croft, the current vicar. Alban Croft’s grandson. He was a kind-faced man in his fifties, usually seen with a smile and a ready word about the church roof fund. Now, his face was pale, his expression unreadable. He held a bunch of keys in his hand.

“Mrs. Plum said she thought she saw someone come in here,” he said, his voice quiet, devoid of its usual warmth. His eyes flicked from Eleanor’s face to the papers in her hands, to the old hymnal on the shelf. “She’s a terrible liar, God love her. I came back early. I… I heard you come in.”

He stepped inside, closing the door softly behind him. The small room became smaller, the air tighter. He didn’t look angry. He looked profoundly tired, and deeply sad.

“You’ve been digging in my grandfather’s garden, Miss Eleanor,” he said, his gaze settling on the envelope in her hand. “And by the look on your face, you’ve found the rotten root.”
