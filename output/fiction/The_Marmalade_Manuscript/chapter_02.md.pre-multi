Chapter 2: Stains and Suspicions

Morning light filled the kitchen of Willow Cottage, a soft, honeyed diffusion pouring through the lace curtains to pool on the worn oak table. Dust motes danced in the beams like tiny, suspended galaxies. At the heart of it sat Eleanor, the strange note—*It wasn’t an accident. Look deeper.*—laid before her like an exhibit. Beside it rested the hefty, cloth-bound cookbook, *The Practical Housekeeper*, smelling of cinnamon and old paper.

Sleep had been elusive, the silence of Honeywick a palpable hum against ears accustomed to London’s perpetual growl. Through the dark, the note had pulsed with a quiet, insistent heartbeat. Now, in the gentle light, she approached it with a scholar’s caution, slipping on the white cotton gloves reserved for fragile documents.

Tucked not into the front, but deep within the pages, the note marked a recipe: *Seville Orange Marmalade*. Agatha’s firm, looping script declared the heading. The recipe itself was detailed, with precise weights and timings, but the margins now snagged Eleanor’s attention. Previously, she’d only seen the note. Now, tiny, meticulous annotations appeared in the same sepia ink, but finer, almost secretive. A date: *Feb ‘57*. An initial: *R.J.*. And a symbol resembling a small, stylised beehive.

Her breath caught. The paper whispered as she turned the page slowly. The next recipe, for Damson Jam, bore similar marks: *Aug ‘56 – L.P. – ☼*. A sun? A coin? Flipping further quickened her archivist’s pulse. Blackberry Jelly: *Oct ‘58 – M.K. – ♒*. Greengage Preserve: *Sept ‘57 – A.B. – ⚖*. A code, or a catalogue. But of what?

For an hour, she methodically went through the entire book. Seventeen annotated recipes emerged, each with a date between 1955 and 1960, a set of initials, and a unique symbol. Only the marmalade recipe, with its accusatory note, also contained the hidden slip of paper. Why this one? The paper was thicker, a creamy vellum distinct from the cookbook’s pages. Holding it carefully by the edges, she raised it towards the window.

Light revealed more than just the fibre. Faint, greyish impressions ghosted across the lower half—not ink, but the indentations of type. Letters pressed into the vellum from something that had lain atop it. A cold, sharp thrill shot through her. Angling the paper and squinting brought fragments into view: *“…local girl…”* and *“…still no sign…”* and a clearer, larger impression: *“1956”*.

A missing girl. 1956. The year matching the first cluster of annotations.

The cottage, so warm and whimsical moments before, seemed to hold its breath. Cheerful gingham curtains, the row of antique spoons on the wall, the dormant Aga cooker—they were no longer just set-dressing for a quaint inheritance, but the backdrop to a quiet, decades-old question.

Air and context were needed, a voice that wasn’t the whispering of old paper. Slipping the note into a clear archival sleeve, she grabbed her coat and stepped out into Honeywick.

On the village green, a postcard came to life. Ducks paddled on the pond, their V-shaped wakes rippling the reflection of the ancient stone church. From a converted forge-turned-gallery came the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith at work, a comforting, ancient metronome. Damp earth, woodsmoke, and the faint scent of baking bread filled the air—the antithesis of mystery, a picture of pastoral permanence.

Her first stop was the village shop, an Aladdin’s cave of everything from parsnips to postcards. Behind the counter stood a woman with kind, forget-me-not blue eyes and a crown of braided silver hair.

“You’ll be Agatha’s niece.” The woman’s smile was immediate and warm. “I’m Betty. We were all so fond of your aunt. A proper character.”

“Eleanor.” She returned the smile, feeling like an imposter. “I’m just starting to realise that.”

“Oh, she was one of a kind.” Betty handed over the milk and local paper. “Best marmalade in three counties. Won more ribbons at the Honeywick Show than I’ve had hot dinners. Her Seville orange was a work of art. Dark, bitter, perfect shred. She’d start in January, when the Seville oranges were just right. Said they had a ‘brief, glorious temper’.”

Seville orange. The hook was set. “Did she… keep records? Of her recipes, her techniques?” Eleanor aimed for casual interest.

Betty chuckled, ringing up the sale. “Agatha? She had it all in her head, dear. Or so we thought. Private about her methods, but generous with the results. Always a jar for a poorly neighbour, or for the vicar’s fête.” Leaning forward slightly, her voice dropped to a confidential tone. “She was a listener, your aunt. People would talk to her. She had a way about her. A quiet curiosity, my Tom always said.”

“Tom?”

“My husband. The postman here for forty years. Knew everyone’s business, but like Agatha, he kept it to himself. He’s out the back, sorting the mail for the afternoon round. Go on through; he’ll be glad of a distraction.”

Pushing through the bead curtain revealed a back room stacked with newspapers and parcels. At a table sat a man with a weathered, friendly face and a postal uniform, spectacles perched on his nose.

“Mr. Postman?” Eleanor began.

“Tom.” He looked up. “And you’re the Vance girl. You have her look about the eyes.” His gaze was direct, but not intrusive.

“Betty said you knew my aunt well.”

“Delivered to Willow Cottage every day for decades.” Tom tied a bundle of letters with a loop of red string. “Rain, snow, or shine. She was always there with a cup of tea ifthe weather was foul, and a question if it wasn’t.”

“A question?”

“Oh, not nosy questions,” Tom said, his hands moving deftly. “Thoughtful ones. ‘Tom, who lived in the old Miller house before the Cartwrights?’ ‘Tom, is it true the stream changed course after the war?’ ‘Tom, whatever happened to the Honeywick silver? The legend, I mean.’ She was piecing the village together, bit by bit. Not the gossip, mind. The history. The underneath of things.”

The underneath of things. The phrase resonated. “Did she ever… receive unusual mail? Or send it?”

Tom paused, his fingers stilling on the string. He looked at Eleanor for a long moment. “She got her historical society journals, her seed catalogues. But about… oh, fifteen years back, there was a period. Letters with no return address. London postmark. And she’d send parcels out, not jars of preserves, but small, flat things. Documents, maybe. Lasted a year or so, then stopped.” He shrugged. “I thought maybe she’d found a pen pal from her past. She was a Wren in the war, you know. Stationed in London. Had stories she never told.”

London. A connection. Eleanor’s mind raced. “Thank you, Tom. That’s… helpful.”

“She was a good soul,” Tom said simply, returning to his sorting. “The kind that notices when a pattern breaks.”

Back at Willow Cottage, Eleanor felt charged with a new purpose. Agatha wasn’t just a marmalade-making eccentric; she was an investigator. A quiet, persistent curator of Honeywick’s secrets. The cookbook wasn’t just a cookbook; it was a ledger. But for what? The initials, the dates, the symbols… and a missing girl from 1956.

She returned to the sitting room desk, but now she looked at it with different eyes. She removed every book, every sheaf of paper, feeling along the backs of the drawers for hidden compartments. In the bottom right drawer, beneath a stack of faded embroidery patterns, her fingers touched something smooth and cold—a key, small and tarnished brass, tied with a faded green ribbon.

It fit nothing in the desk. She tried the cupboards, the old trunk, the writing box. Nothing. Frustrated, she stood in the centre of the room, turning in a slow circle. Her gaze fell on the bookshelf, not on the books, but on the objects placed between them: a piece of coral, a fossil, a small china shepherdess. And there, behind a bulky volume on British birdlife, was a tiny, keyhole-sized brass plate set into the wood of the shelf itself.

Heart thumping, she pushed the book aside. The key slid in and turned with a satisfying click. A small, rectangular section of the bookshelf, designed to look like a solid panel, sprang open a fraction. Behind it was a shallow recess, and inside, lying flat, was a journal.

It was bound in good-quality leather, darkened with age but not cracked. On the front, in Agatha’s now-familiar hand, was a label: The Honeywick Matter.

The Honeywick Matter. The phrase had weight, formality. Eleanor lifted it out. It was lighter than she expected. She opened it, and her hopeful anticipation curdled into confusion.

The pages were empty.

Every single one. A book of blank, creamy paper. She fanned through it, held it up to the light. Not a mark, not a stain, not a impression. Nothing. Why go to the trouble of a hidden compartment for a blank book?

Disappointment was a cold stone in her stomach. She sank into Agatha’s armchair, the empty journal in her lap. Was this it? A wild goose chase sparked by a senile old woman’s paranoia? The warm whimsy of the cottage felt cloying now, a disguise for futility.

As the afternoon light began to slant, painting the room in long, melancholy shadows, she absently ran her fingers over the journal’s cover. Then she felt it. Not on the cover, but on the spine. A slight bump, a ridge. She examined it closely. The leather on the spine was slightly raised. With careful pressure, she found it wasn’t glued flat; there was a hidden pocket sewn into the spine’s lining.

Her nails, short and practical, just caught the edge. She pulled gently, and a single, folded sheet of paper, much older and more fragile than the journal’s pages, slid out.

It was a list. Not in a code of symbols, but in plain, stark English. At the top was written: Correspondents & Initials. The Honeywick Matter.

Beneath was a column:

R.J. – Rev. James Allerton (Vicar, St. Botolph’s, 1948-1971)
L.P. – Mrs. Lillian Price (Postmistress, 1932-1967)
M.K. – Mr. Michael Keene (Schoolmaster, Honeywick Primary, 1950-1980)
A.B. – Alderman Bertram Shaw (Chairman, Parish Council, 1954-1962)
…

The list went on, seventeen names in total. Every set of initials from the cookbook margins was here, matched with a name and a role in the village. These weren’t random marks. They were people. Important people. The pillars of Honeywick society in the 1950s.

At the bottom of the list, in a fiercer, more urgent script than the rest, Agatha had written: They all knew. And none would speak. The silence was the accident.

Eleanor stared until the words blurred. The quiet of the cottage was no longer empty; it was thick with the echoes of that silence. She looked from the list to the blank journal. It wasn’t a record. It was a receptacle. It was waiting for the story to be written.

The hook came as she went to fold the list away, her eyes glancing at the newspaper on the table, bought that morning from Betty. The Honeywick Gazette had a small headline about a planned renovation to the village hall. But her mind was elsewhere, superimposing the ghostly impressions from Agatha’s note onto a different front page. A local girl. Missing. 1956.

She needed that clipping.

She went to the desk and pulled out the local telephone directory, its pages yellowed. Under ‘L’ she found it: Honeywick Gazette Archives. By appointment only. Inquire at the Editor’s office, Church Lane.

The light was fading fast, but a fierce, warm curiosity, inherited and undeniable, burned within her. She would not wait for morning. Grabbing her coat and the archival sleeve containing the note, Eleanor Vance stepped out into the lavender dusk, the empty journal—the silent heart of The Honeywick Matter—left behind on the chair, its secret finally beginning to stir. She was no longer just settling an estate. She was following a trail of ink, marmalade stains, and silence, straight into the hidden heart of the village, and towards a headline that had haunted her aunt for a lifetime.
