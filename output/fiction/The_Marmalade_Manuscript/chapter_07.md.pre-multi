Chapter 7: A Tangled Web

The scent of the break-in lingered. It wasn’t just the faint, acrid hint of disturbed dust and cold night air that had seeped into the cottage’s bones; it was the violation. Eleanor sat at the kitchen table, her hands wrapped around a mug of strong, sweet tea she didn’t really want. The morning sun, usually a buttery blessing through the leaded windows, felt interrogative. It highlighted every fingerprint on the glass, every scuff on the floorboards that might not have been there yesterday.

Constable Wells, a kind man with a voice like rolling gravel and a mustache that seemed to absorb his upper lip when he was thinking, had been thorough but unconvinced. “Nothing taken, Miss Eleanor,” he’d said, snapping his notebook shut. “Just a mess. Likely lads from over Penkett way, heard about a lonely cottage, looking for cash for a weekend in Brighton. Found nothing but cookbooks and jam. Sorry for the upset.”

But Eleanor knew. They hadn’t found nothing. They had been looking for something. Her aunt’s collection of cookbooks, usually standing in serene, chronological order on the pine shelves in the parlour, had been pulled into a paper avalanche on the hearth rug. They weren’t ripped or torn—they’d been examined, swiftly, desperately. Pages riffled. Then discarded.

After the constable’s car had crunched away down the lane, Eleanor began the slow, tactile process of restoration. It was her therapy. Each book she lifted was a familiar friend: Mrs. Beeton’s Every-Day Cookery (1893), its spine cracked at the chapter on “Invalid Cookery”; The Constance Spry Cookery Book (1956), dotted with Agatha’s notes in the margin next to the raised game pie; a splattered, beloved copy of French Provincial Cooking by Elizabeth David.

As she slotted The Jams, Preserves & Chutneys of the British Isles back into place, a slip of paper, thin as a dragonfly’s wing, fluttered from its pages. It was a recipe for damson cheese, written in a hand that was not Agatha’s. This was older, spidery, the ink faded to a watery brown. At the top, it read: “For a Clear Conscience – and a Firm Set.” And beneath the title, the initials: V.V.

V.V. They were not in Agatha’s cipher index. Eleanor’s heart did a small, quickstep against her ribs. She carried the fragment to the kitchen table, smoothing it under her palm. The paper was different—a finer, almost translucent stock compared to Agatha’s robust notecards. This was a ghost, slipped between the pages, waiting.

The rest of the day was spent in a state of heightened focus. The fear had turned into a sharp, glittering determination. She worked her way through the remaining books, but found no other traces of V.V. Then she turned to the village archives—a grandiose term for a collection of parish magazines, old Women’s Institute minutes, and school play programmes kept in a musty cupboard in the village hall.

It was in a brittle copy of The St. Botolph’s Parish Chronicle, December
