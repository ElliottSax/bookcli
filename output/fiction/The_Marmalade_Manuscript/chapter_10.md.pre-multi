Chapter 10: A Conscience Unburdened

Chapter 10: A Conscience Unburdened

The rain, which had been a gentle companion all afternoon, settled into a steady, whispering rhythm against the windowpanes of Willow Cottage. Inside, the world had shrunk to the circle of lamplight pooling on the worn kitchen table, where Eleanor sat opposite Thomas Bell. The air was thick with the scent of damp wool, old wood, and the ghost of Agatha’s lavender polish. Thomas’s large, work-roughened hands were wrapped around a mug of tea Eleanor had made, but he hadn’t taken a sip. He simply stared into its amber depths as if reading leaves at the bottom of a well.

Eleanor waited. The silence wasn’t empty; it was full of the fifty years Thomas had carried in his throat.

“She used to give me lemon drops,” he began, his voice a low rumble that seemed to rise from the stone floor. “Lily. I was a scrawny lad, all knees and elbows, and she’d always have a sweet in her apron pocket for me. Called me her ‘solemn shadow.’” A faint, pained smile touched his lips. “I suppose I was. I… admired her. Not in the way the others did, with their poems and sighs. She was like a kingfisher, you see? A flash of bright, impossible colour in our grey little stream.”

He shifted in his chair, the wood creaking in sympathy. “That last evening… I’d seen her slip out. She had a look about her. A determined sort of glow. I was curious. So I followed. Not out of malice. Just… to keep that flash of colour in sight a little longer.”

He described the scene with a painter’s detail, and Eleanor could see it: the long, late-summer twilight gilding the edges of the Green, the scent of cut grass and honeysuckle heavy in the air. Lily, in a simple cornflower-blue dress, moving not towards the woods where lovers met, but towards the old stone church. Thomas, a gangly ghost, flitting from yew tree to mossy wall.

“She went into the churchyard. I hung back by the lychgate. And then he came out of the vestry door. Reverend Croft.”

Thomas’s knuckles whitened around the mug. “He wasn’t in his robes. Just his trousers and a white shirt, sleeves rolled up. He looked… ordinary. Human. They talked. I was too far to hear, but her body… it changed. The eager lean forward, then a step back. Her hands came up, not in greeting, but as if to push something away. He reached for her arm. She shook her head, turned to leave.”

The rain tapped a little harder on the glass. Thomas’s eyes were no longer in the room; they were fixed on a memory etched in stone and shadow.

“He grabbed her then. Properly. Not a pastoral gesture. A hard grip. She tried to pull away, and they… they struggled. It was silent, fierce. Like a dreadful pantomime. He was a big man, strong from gardening and walking his parish. She was just a wisp of a thing. She stumbled back, her foot caught on that old, half-sunken grave slab—the one for Jeremiah Miller, 1742. She lost her balance.”

A long, shuddering breath escaped him. “He let go. Or she pulled free. I don’t know. But she fell. There was a sound… a dreadful, soft crack, like a green branch snapping underfoot. It wasn’t loud, but it’s been the loudest sound in my life for fifty years.”

Eleanor’s hand had flown to her mouth. The theory, Agatha’s careful, intellectual puzzle, collapsed under the weight of this visceral, awful truth. It was no longer a mystery; it was a broken body in the twilight.

“She just… lay there. So still. The Reverend… he stood over her for a full minute. Then he knelt. He felt her wrist, her throat. He looked around, wild-like. I froze, pressed into the shadow of the yew, my heart hammering so loud I was sure he’d hear it. He didn’t see me. He picked her up. She was a rag doll in his arms. And he carried her… not towards the village, but around the back of the church, towards the old shed where he kept the tools for the grounds.”

Thomas finally looked up, his eyes swimming with a boy’s terror. “I ran. I ran until my lungs burned and the brambles tore my clothes. I ran home, up to my room, and I put my head under the pillow like a child. I told no one. Not a soul. The next day, he made the announcement at morning service. That sweet Lily Abbott had likely run off to the city. That we should pray for her soul. And we all believed him. He was the Reverend. The Reverend.”

The silence that followed was a living thing, swollen with grief and complicity. Eleanor found her voice, soft as the rain. “Why now, Thomas? Why come to me?”

“Your aunt,” he said, the words thick with guilt. “Agatha. She started poking around a few years back. Asking gentle questions about the old days, about Lily. She had a way about her—no judgement, just a deep, quiet listening. I think she knew. Not the details, but she’d pieced together the shape of it. The Reverend’s too-perfect grief, the way he’d redirected everyone’s thoughts. She called him a ‘wolf in shepherd’s clothing’ once, to me, in this very kitchen. I nearly choked on my tea.”

He looked around the cottage, his gaze lingering on the repaired lock on the back door. “When she died, and you came… I was terrified. I thought she’d left you a letter, a diary, something that spelled it all out. That you’d dig it up and the whole rotten truth would tumble out, and they’d see me for the coward I’ve been every day of my life since. So I… I watched you. And when I saw you at the archives, talking to that clerk, and then coming back with that look in your eye—the same look Agatha got—I panicked. I broke in. I’m so sorry, Eleanor. I just wanted to find her notes, her papers. I didn’t take anything else. I didn’t mean to frighten you so.”

The confession hung in the air, a sad, sorry counterpart to the greater horror. Eleanor felt no anger towards him, only a profound, aching pity. He had been a boy, trapped in a nightmare of a man’s making.

“You’ve been punishing yourself longer than any court ever could,” she said gently.

He nodded, a tear finally escaping down the weathered groove of his cheek. “A life sentence. I married a good woman, but I could never quite be fully present for her. I tended my garden, but I could never enjoy its peace. Every time I saw the Reverend—even after he retired, a frail old man being praised for his service—I saw that flash of blue, heard that terrible crack. I buried it, just like he buried… whatever he did with her.”

He straightened up slightly, as if setting down a physical burden. “Agatha’s theory was right. He loved her, or thought he did. A forbidden, obsessive thing. When she rejected him… it wasn’t premeditated murder. It was a terrible, violent accident born of a moment of rage and possession. But the cover-up… that was the real sin. That was the cold, calculated choice. And my silence made me his accomplice.”

Just as he finished, the sound they both had been half-consciously dreading cut through the murmur of the rain: a firm, official knock on the front door.

Rap. Rap. Rap.

Eleanor and Thomas locked eyes. The spell of the confession shattered, replaced by a sharp, present fear.

“Are you expecting anyone?” Thomas whispered, his face pale.

“No.”

The knock came again, more insistent. Through the frosted glass of the front door, Eleanor could make out the bulky silhouette of a man in a peaked cap.

Her heart sank. She walked to the door, Thomas rising hesitantly behind her, and opened it.

Constable Wells stood on the step, his waterproof cape dark with rain. His kind, lined face was uncharacteristically stern. Behind him, the village green was a blur of wet green and grey.

“Miss Eleanor,” he said, his voice formal. “Sorry to disturb you on such an evening.”

“Constable Wells. Is everything alright?”

“I’ve had a rather serious complaint come in,” he said, stepping past her into the cottage after a brief, acknowledging nod to Thomas. He removed his cap, revealing damp, thinning hair. “Anonymous tip, called into the station. Said there’s been a campaign of harassment against certain elderly residents of the village. Mentioned you by name. Said you’ve been stirring up trouble, accusing respected figures of the past with baseless rumours, upsetting folks for your own amusement.” His eyes, usually twinkling, were sharp and assessing as they moved from Eleanor’s anxious face to Thomas’s guilty one. “Said I’d find evidence of it here.”

The room grew very cold. The anonymous tip. It could only be from one source: someone who felt the past stirring uncomfortably under their feet. Someone who wanted to discredit the seeker before the truth could be found.

Constable Wells’s gaze settled on Thomas. “Afternoon, Thomas. You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Thomas opened his mouth, but no sound came out. The burden of a lifetime had been confessed, only to be met by the heavy hand of the law at the door. The past had finally, decisively, crashed into the present.

Eleanor looked from the constable’s official frown to Thomas’s shattered expression, then to the rain-streaked window and the church spire beyond. The hook was set. The wolf, it seemed, still had teeth.
