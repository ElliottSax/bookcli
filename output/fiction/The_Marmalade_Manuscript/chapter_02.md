Chapter 2: Stains and Suspicions

Morning light filled the kitchen of Willow Cottage, a soft glow pouring through the lace curtains to pool on the worn oak table. Dust motes danced in the beams like tiny suspended particles. At the center of it all sat Eleanor Vance, the strange note - *It wasn’t an accident. Look deeper.* - laid before her. Beside it rested the hefty, cloth-bound cookbook, *The Practical Housekeeper*, smelling of cinnamon and old paper.
She had slept poorly, the silence of Honeywick a stark contrast to the constant noise of London Archives. The note had been on her mind all night, and now, in the gentle light, she approached it with caution, slipping on the white cotton gloves she used for fragile documents.
The note was tucked deep within the pages, marking a recipe for Seville Orange Marmalade. Agatha’s firm script declared the heading. The recipe itself was detailed, but the margins caught Eleanor's attention. Tiny, meticulous annotations appeared in the same ink, but finer, almost secretive. A date: Feb ‘57. An initial: R.J.. And a symbol resembling a small beehive.
Her breath caught as she turned the page slowly. The next recipe, for Damson Jam, had similar marks: Aug ‘56 – L.P. – ☼. A sun? A coin? As she flipped further, a jolt of electricity ran through her veins. Blackberry Jelly: Oct ‘58 – M.K. – ♒. Greengage Preserve: Sept ‘57 – A.B. – ⚖. This looked like a code, or a catalogue. But what did it mean?
Eleanor spent the next hour going through the entire book. Seventeen annotated recipes emerged, each with a date between 1955 and 1960, a set of initials, and a unique symbol. Only the marmalade recipe had the hidden slip of paper with the accusatory note. Why this one? The paper was thicker, a creamy vellum distinct from the cookbook’s pages. Holding it carefully, she raised it toward the window.
The light revealed more than just the fiber. Faint, greyish impressions showed up on the lower half - not ink, but the indentations of type. Letters were pressed into the vellum from something that had lain on top of it. A cold thrill shot through her. Angling the paper and squinting brought fragments into view: “…local girl…” and “…still no sign…” and a clearer impression: “1956”.
A missing girl. 1956. The year matched the first cluster of annotations.
The cottage, once warm and welcoming, now was holding its breath. The cheerful curtains, the row of antique spoons, and the dormant Aga cooker were no longer just decorations, but the backdrop to a decades-old question.
Eleanor needed some fresh air and context, a voice that wasn’t simply the whisper of old paper. She slipped the note into a clear sleeve, grabbed her coat, and stepped out into Honeywick.
On the village green, the scene came alive. Ducks paddled on the pond, their wakes rippling the reflection of the ancient stone church. From a converted forge came the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith at work, a comforting sound. The air was filled with the scent of damp earth, woodsmoke, and baking bread - a peaceful scene that seemed at odds with the mystery.
Her first stop was the village shop, a small store that sold everything from parsnips to postcards. Behind the counter stood a woman with kind eyes and a crown of braided silver hair.
“You must be Agatha’s niece,” the woman said with a warm smile. “I’m Betty. We all loved your aunt. She was a unique person.”

“Eleanor Vance,” she replied, feeling a bit like an imposter. “I’m just starting to realize that.”

Betty handed over the milk and local paper. “Your aunt was one of a kind. She made the best marmalade in three counties. Won many awards at the Honeywick Show. Her Seville orange marmalade was a work of art. Dark, bitter, perfect shred. She’d start making it in January, when the Seville oranges wer merely st right. She said they had a ‘brief, glorious temper’.”

Seville orange. That caught Eleanor's attention. “Did she keep records of her recipes and techniques?” she asked, trying to sound casual.
Betty chuckled, ringing up the sale. “Agatha? She kept it all in her head, dear. Or so we thought. She was private about her methods, but generous with the results. Always a jar for a neighbor or for the vicar’s fête.” Leaning forward, her voice dropped to a confidential tone. “She was a good listener, your aunt. People would talk to her. She had a way about her. My husband Tom always replied she had a quiet curiosity.”

“Tom?” Eleanor asked.
“My husband. He was the postman here for forty years. He knew everyone’s business, but like Agatha, he kept it to himself. He’s out back, sorting the mail. Go on through; he’ll be glad of a distraction.”

Pushing through the bead curtain revealed a back room stacked with newspapers and parcels. At a table sat a man with a weathered, friendly face and a postal uniform, spectacles perched on his nose.
“Mr. Postman?” Eleanor Vance began.
“Tom.” He looked up. “And you’re the Vance girl. You have her look about the eyes.” His gaze was direct, but not intrusive.
“Betty said you knew my aunt well.”

“Delivered to Willow Cottage every day for decades.” Tom tied a bundle of letters with a loop of red string. “Rain, snow, or shine. She was always there with a cup of tea if the weather was foul, and a question if it wasn’t.”

“A question?”

“Oh, not nosy questions,” T answered, his hands moving deftly. “Thoughtful ones. ‘Tom, who lived in the old Miller house before the Cartwrights?’ ‘Tom, is it true the stream changed course after the war?’ ‘Tom, whatever happened to the Honeywick silver? The legend, I mean.’ She was piecing the village together, bit by bit. Not the gossip, mind. The history. The underneath of things.”

*The underneath of things.* A shiver traced Eleanor Vance’s spine.ver run down her spine. “What do you mean by the underneath of things?”

Tom paused, his eyes reflecting a deep well of memories. “Agatha saw beyond the surface. She understood that every story has layers, and sometimes those layers are hidden, waiting to be uncovered. Like the roots of an old tree, they run deep and wide, connecting everything in ways we can’t always see.”

Eleanor Vance nodded, her curiosity piqued. “Do you remember anything specific from those conversations? Anything that might help me understand her better?”

Tom leaned back in his chair, the creak of the wood echoing softly in the room. “There was one incident that always stuck with me. It was in 1956, the year of the missing girl. Agatha was particularly interested in that case. She’d ask about it whenever she could, trying to piece together what had happened. She never spoke of it openly, but I could tell it troubled her deeply.”

“Missing girl?” Eleanor Vance’s heart raced. “Can you tell me more about it?”

Tom sighed, a long, slow exhale. “It was a young girl named Lily. She disappeared without a trace. The whole village was in an uproar. Searches were organized, the police were called in, but nothing. No leads, no clues. It was as if she vanished into thin air. Some people said she ran away, others whispered about darker possibilities. But no one ever found out what really happened.”

Eleanor Vance’s mind raced, connecting the dots. The note, the annotations, the missing girl—everything pointed to a deeper mystery. “Do you think Agatha suspected something more?”

Tom’s eyes met hers, a mix of sadness and resolve. “Agatha was a woman of few words, but when she spoke, you listened. She once told me, ‘Sometimes the truth is buried beneath the soil, and it takes patience and care to unearth it.’ I believe she was onto something, but she never shared her findings with anyone. If you want to know more, you’ll have to dig deeper yourself.”

Eleanor Vance thanked Tom and stepped back into the bright morning light. The village greeto stretch out before her, a mix of lives and stories woven together over generations. She walked slowly, her mind a whirl of questions and possibilities. The path led her to the village church, its ancient stone walls standing as a silent witness to the passage of time.
Inside, the air was cool and fragrant with the scent of old wood and polished brass. Stained glass windows cast colorful patterns on the stone floor, and the soft hum of a hymn drifted from the choir loft. Eleanor Vance found a pew near the back and sat down, letting the quiet envelop her.
As she sat, she opened the cookbook again, tracing the annotations with her finger. Each mark, each symbol, was a clue, a piece of a puzzle waiting to be solved. She closed her eyes, trying to imagine Agatha’s world, the village as it was in the 1950s. The people, the places, the secrets they held.
When she opened her eyes, a tiny, leather-bound journal caught her eye on the pew in front of her. It was old, the cover worn and faded, but the pages inside were surprisingly well-preserved. Curiosity got the better of her, and she opened it to find a series of entries, each dated and signed with initials.
March 15, 1956 - L.P.
The search continues. No sign of Lily. The villagers are growing restless. Agatha seems more determined than ever to find answers. She spends hours poring over old maps and records, asking questions no one else thinks to ask. I hope she finds what she’s looking for, but part of me fears what the truth might reveal.
May 3, 1956 - R.J.
Agatha has been visiting the old millhouse. She says she feels a connection to the place, that it holds secrets. I don’t understand it, but I trust her instincts. She’s always been good at seeing things others miss.
July 12, 1956 - M.K.
The police have given up. They say there’s nothing more they can do. But Agatha won’t let it go. She’s been talking to the older residents, digging through archives. She believes there’s more to the story, and I have to agree. Something doesn’t feel right.
Eleanor’s heart raced. The journal entries matched the notes in the cookbook, proving Agatha’s search had gone much deeper than she’d thought. She slipped the journal into her bag, meaning to bring it back later, and left the church, her head full of questions.
Back at Willow Cottage, Eleanor spread the cookbook and the journal on the kitchen table, lining up the dates and initials. Things were starting to connect, but the story was still incomplete. She needed to know more.
She decided to go to the village hall, where the old records were kept. The building was plain, its wooden doors groaning as she pushed them open. Inside, the air smelled of old paper, and shelves were packed with dusty files and ledgers.
At a desk by the window, an elderly woman with a keen look glanced up. “Can I help you?”

“I’m Eleanor Vancemurmuredhe said. “I’m trying to learn about my aunt, Agatha Vance. She lived here in the fifties and sixties. I found some notes that make me think she was looking into a missing girl from 1956. Is there anything here about that?”

The woman’s face softened with recognition. “Agatha Vance. She was a force. I remember her. I’m Margaret, the archivist. What do you need?”

Eleanor showed her the cookbook and the journal. Margaret studied them closely. “This is interesting. Agatha always had an eye for what others missed. Let me see what we have.”

Margaret took her to a part of the archives for local history. After a short search, she pulled out a file labeled *Honeywick Missing Persons - 1956*.
“This is where to start,” Margaret said, handing it over. “Lily’s case is in here, along with others from that year. There are newspaper articles and police reports, too.”

Eleanor found a chair and opened the file. The first page was a police report. Lily was last seen leaving school on a Friday afternoon, her backpack over her shoulder. People remembered her walking home, but after that, she vanished.
The newspaper clippings told a story of growing worry. The town arrived together, forming search parties and offering rewards. But as days became weeks, and weeks became months, people lose hope.
Eleanor’s chest tightened as she read. Lily’s parents, her friends, the whole village—everyone had been shaken by her disappearance. And still, no one ever learned what happened.
Further in, she found letters from villagers to the police. One stood out. It was from a woman named Martha, who lived near the old millhouse.
*Dear Sir,*

*I’m writing about Lily going missing. I’ve lived in Honeywick a long time, and I’ve seen strange things around the old millhouse lately. It’s been empty for years, but now I see lights and hear noises there late at night. I think it might have something to do with Lily. Please look into it.*

*Sincerely,*
*Martha*

Eleanor’s pulse jumped. The millhouse. It was in the journal, and now in this letter. That couldn’t be an accident.
She thanked Margaret and went back to Willow Cottage, her thoughts racing. The millhouse was clearly her next step. She was going to find the truth, whatever it was.
As the sun dipped low, stretching shadows across the village, Eleanor walked toward the old millhouse. The path was tangled with weeds, the air sweet with wildflowers and wet soil. The building stood ahead, its old walls crumbling under a blanket of ivy.
Inside, the air was stale and damp. It was dark, with only thin shafts of light breaking through the walls. She moved carefully, her flashlight piercing the gloom. The main room was empty, just broken wood and rubble scattered across the floor.
But as she explored further, she found a small, hidden compartment behind a loose brick in the wall. Inside, wrapped in an oilskin, was a collection of old photographs and documents. Eleanor Vance’s hands trembled as she unfolded the papers, revealing a series of letters and notes, all dated from the 1950s.
One letter, in particular, stood out. It was addressed to Agatha, and the handwriting was familiar—Martha’s.
Dear Agatha,

I know you are determined to find out what happened to Lily. I have some information that may help. The millhouse has a secret room, hidden behind the wall. I discovered it by accident, and inside, I found evidence that suggests Lily was held captive there. I fear for her safety, and I believe someone is covering it up. Please, be careful. There are powerful forces at play, and they will stop at nothing to keep the truth buried.
Yours truly,
Martha

Eleanor Vance’s heart raced as she read the letter. The pieces were finally coming together. The millhouse, the hidden room, the missing girl—Agatha had been right all along. Someone had taken Lily, and they had gone to great lengths to cover it up.
But why? And who was behind it?
With the evidence in hand, Eleanor Vance knew she had to act quickly. She needed to speak to the remaining villagers who might have known something, to piece together the final parts of the puzzle.
As she left the millhouse, the sky was darkening, the stars beginning to twinkle overhead. The village of Honeywick, so peaceful and idyllic on the surface, held a dark secret. And Eleanor Vance was determined to bring it to light, no matter the cost.
