Chapter 6: Sweet Talk and Sour Notes

The scent of damp earth and cold petals greeted Eleanor Vance as she pushed open the door of 'Betty's Blooms'. The little florist's shop was a burst of colour in the grey afternoon, filled with the strong smell of lilies and the spicy tang of chrysan the mums. Behind the counter, covered in green tape and snipped stems, stood Betty Finch, a woman who seemed as delicate as her flowers. She was small, with fine features and hands that fluttered as she wired a spray of baby's breath.
"Miss Finch? I'm Eleanor Vance Swift, Agatha's niece," Eleanor Vance said softly, trying not to startle her.
Betty's eyes, a pale blue, darted to Eleanor Vance and then away. "Yes, you called. It's terrible about Agatha. She was a lovely woman. She always bought a pot of rosemary for remembrance, every Sunday after church." She snipped a stem with a sharp click.
Eleanor Vance continued, "I'm trying to learn more about her local history work. She mentioned you were a friend of Lily Bright's."

The name made Betty's hands stop moving. The shop was silent, except for the sound of water dripping from a hanging basket of ferns. "Lily," Betty repeated, barely above a whisper. "That was a long time ago."

Eleanor Vance leaned on the counter, which was cool and slightly sticky with sap. "I've been reading old village newsletters. Lily seemed so full of life. I wondered what she was like as a friend."

Betty's gaze fixed on a bucket of deep red roses. "She was lively. That's the word people used to describe her. And she was. She made everywhere she went feel brighter and warmer." A faint smile touched her lips. "She could talk anyone into doing anything. She got me to climb the old oak by the millpond once, to see a nest. I was scared, but she just laughed."

Eleanor Vance asked, "It must have been awful when she disappeared."

Betty's hands started moving again, busy with organising ribbons. "It was like losing the sun. For all of us. The questions, the police... it was a difficult time. We were just girls." Her voice was tight and thin. "I don't remember much else. It's all a bit of a blur."

Eleanor Vance sensed that Betty was hiding something, that she had built a wall around her memories over the years. "Did Agatha ever talk to you about Lily in recent years?"

Betty looked at Eleanor Vance, her expression pleading. "Agatha asked me a few times. I told her the same thing. Some things are better left in the past." She finally looked at Eleanor Vance. "The past can be painful, Miss Swift. It's not always a good idea to bring it up. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a funeral wreath to prepare. The Coombes service is tomorrow."

Eleanor Vance bought a small bunch of snowdrops and left the shop. Betty's fear was clear, a living thing in that fragrant room. It wasn't simply grief; it was a nervous avoidance.
Robert Miller, the third friend, was nowhere to be found. A visit to the village hall records, helped by a curious Mrs. Pembroke, confirmed it: Robert Arthur Miller had emigrated to Perth, Australia, in October 1957, a little over a year after Lily vanished. The entry was simple and final. Eleanor Vance copied the details, noticing the significance of the date. He left. Was it because of grief, or something else?
Her next stop was the butcher's. 'T. Croft & Son' was a shop with gleaming white tiles and the rich smell of fresh blood. Thomas Croft was a broad, solid man with thick forearms and a face that had been weathered by years of wind and hard work. He glanced up from sharpening a long knife on a steel, the sound a harsh rhythm.
"Help you?" he grunted.
Eleanor Vance explained that she was researching village history. When she mentioned Lily Bright, the sharpening didn't pause, but his eyes hardened.
"Lily Bright," he said, the name unpleasant. "I haven't heard that name in years. She was a dreamer, always coming up with wild ideas."

"You knew her?"

"Everyone knew her," he replied, setting the knife down. "Look, Miss, I've got a business to run. History is for books. We live in the present here."

Eleanor Vance asked, "Her disappearance must have shaken the village."

“Lots of things shake villages. Storms. Illness. Foxes in the henhouse.” He picked up a cleaver, his meaning as blunt as the tool. “Some hens wander off. You don’t spend your life looking for them. You mend the fence and get on with it.”

“Did you speak to the police at the time?”

His stare was a physical pressure. “I answered their questions. Told them I’d seen nothing. Because I hadn’t. Now, if you’re not buying, you’re blocking the counter.” He turned his broad back to her, a definitive end to the conversation. The message was clear: Let sleeping dogs lie. But the vehemence suggested the dogs weren’t sleeping; they were growling, just out of sight.
The sour note of the encounter still with her, Eleanor decided on a gentler approach. She found old Gerald, the retired postman, on his usual bench by the war memorial, feeding crusts to a hopeful robin. His memory was a famously huge, if slightly jumbled, record of village life.
Eleanor’s eyes lingered on the note, her mind racing. She turned to Betty, who stood frozen behind the counter, her hands still clutching the wire. "Who wrote this?" Eleanor asked, her voice barely a whisper.
Betty’s eyes darted to the note, then back to Eleanor, her face a mask of shock and fear. "I...I don’t know," she stammered, her voice trembling.
Eleanor’s gaze swept the shop, taking in the rows of flowers, the neatly arranged bouquets, and the faint scent of damp earth in the air. It was a scent that brought back memories of her own childhood, of helping her mother in the garden on sunny afternoons. But this was different. This was a scent of unease, of hidden secrets.
She turned back to Betty, her eyes searching. "Tell me, Betty, what's going on in this village? What's behind all these strange occurrences?"

The faint scent of lilies and damp earth clung to Eleanor as she stepped out of Betty's Blooms, her feet squelching on the wet pavement. The grey drizzle of the afternoon wa merely st beginning to clear, leaving a faint sheen on the ground that mirrored the flowers inside.
She wandered down the village's main street, her eyes scanning the houses. The once-bright paintwork had begun to peel and the windows, some of them boarded up, looked grim. As she walked, she noticed something odd: every garden she passed was immaculate. Not a single weed sprouted through the carefully tended lawns, and every bloom was perfectly pruned. Feelings of unease settled over her.
Eleanor’s eyes lingered on the crumpled note as she descended the creaky stairs to her tiny cottage's kitchen. The moon cast a silver glow over the table, where the scone now seemed an odd offering. A fine thread of dust clung to the knife, and the scone's torn edges suggested a force more violent than a domestic spat.
She poured a cup of lukewarm coffee and sipped it slowly, trying to thaw the chill at the base of her spine. The clock on the kitchen wall ticked on, each hollow beat a reminder that time moved regardless of secrets and lies. The words on the note echoed in her mind: "Stop digging in my garden." She wondered whose fierce possessiveness had led to such a brazen act, and what lay hidden beneath the surface of this sleepy village, waiting to be found.
The kitchen appeared to darken around her as the moon outside dipped toward the horizon. With an effort, Eleanor pushed the scone aside and opened the kitchen window. A breath of damp, cold air filled the space. The sounds of the night were almost palpable: crickets chirping, rain trickling off leaves, and the faint, distant call of a fox. For a moment, Eleanor forgot the cryptic message and the fragile balance of secrets and lies. She stood there, suspended in the darkness, listening to the chorus of the night, as if waiting for a hidden, and much darker, melody.
She passed a small cottage, its garden a tangled mess of wild blooms and overgrown bushes. In the midst of this lush chaos, a single flower bloomed: a lonely, exquisite rose with delicate pink petals and a soft white scent. Eleanor halted, her hand reaching out to touch its velvety petals.
A soft voice whispered from the doorway, "Some people like order. Others prefer a little chaos." Eleanor turned to find an elderly woman, her silver hair wispy and untamed, with eyes thato hold a secret.
Betty's hands flutter again, this time more rapidly, as if she was trying to conjure up a response. "I...I don't know what you're talking about," she said, her voice laced with a hint of desperation.
Eleanor’s eyes narrowed, her mind working to piece together the clues. She knew that Betty was hiding something, but what? And why was she so afraid?
As she stood there, the silence between them grew thicker, like a fog that refused to lift. The only sound was the soft hum of the refrigerator in the back room, and the distant patter of rain on the pavement outside.
Eleanor Vance's eyes locked onto Betty's, searching for a glimmer of truth. But all she saw was a mask of fear, a mask that seemed to ing a secret that could destroy them both.
“Lily Bright?” he chirped, his face wrinkling into a smile. “Oh, aye. Pretty as a picture. Had a smile for everyone, including the postman. Even for the sourpusses.” He nodded in the general direction of the high street. “She worked in her dad’s shop, you know. The bakery. Always had a floury handprint on her apron.”

“What do you remember about her, Gerald?”

“She had a secret admirer,” answeredaid, leaning in conspiratorially, his breath smelling of peppermints. “Proper romantic, it was. Notes. He’d leave them in the till at the bakery, when she was working. She’d open the till and there it’d be, among the shillings and pence. Made her blush like a rose, it did.”

Eleanor Vance’s pulse quickened. “Did you ever see who left them?”

“Oh, no. Sly, that one. Must have slipped them in when she was fetching a loaf from the back, or serving another customer. I saw her find one once. Her face… well.” He sighed, a wistful sound. “Young love. Or so we thought. Then she was gone, and that was that. The notes stopped, of course. Everything stopped.”

A secret admirer. Notes in the till. It was a tiny, tantalising thread. Eleanor Vance thanked Gerald, leaving him with a new packet of digestives from her bag, and walked back to Ivy Cottage, her mind whirring. The coded recipes, Betty’s fear, Thomas’s hostility, and now a clandestine romance. She Agatha’s presence strongly, as if her aunt were walking beside her, nodding in quiet encouragement.
Back in the cottage’s warm, silent kitchen, she brewed a pot of strong Darjeeling and pulled out the next recipe in Agatha’s cipher: Scones for a Stormy Afternoon. The instructions were, as always, perfectly normal on the surface: Rub the butter in until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. A light touch is essential. Beware a heavy hand. But the extra notes, written in Agatha’s tight script in the margin, were the key.
‘L. spoke of a new shepherd on the hills. Met in the lane. Charmer. But watchful eyes. Agatha, trust your nose. A wolf in shepherd’s clothing? Check the parish news, summer ’56.’

A wolf in shepherd’s clothing. The phrase sent a chill through Eleanor Vance, despite the steam from her tea. She fetched the box of parish magazines she’d brought from the archive. Summer 1956. She flipped through the yellowed pages—jumble sales, cricket matches, harvest festival notices. And then, in the August edition, she found it: a slittleannouncement. ‘The Parish Council welcomes Mr. Alistair Reed, who has taken up the tenancy of High Pasture Farm and its flock, following the retirement of Mr. Jenkins. We wish him well in his new venture.’

Alistair Reed. The new shepherd. Eleanor Vance stared at the name. Had he been the secret admirer? The wolf? Was he even still here? A quick check of the current parish directory showed no Reed at High Pasture. Another dead end, or a thread to be pulled?
The afternoon had bled into evening, and the cottage was filled with deep, velvety shadows. The stormy afternoon had indeed arrived, with rain now lashing the windows. Eleanor Vance decided to enact the second part of Agatha’s scone recipe—the ‘light touch’ instruction. She went to the pantry, to the specific canister of flour Agatha had always used. Dipping her hand in, she past the fine powder, her fingers brushing the smooth ceramic sides until they found it: a small, oilcloth pouch, tucked right at the bottom.
Her heart hammered against her ribs. She pulled it out, wiping flour from its surface. Inside was not a recipe, but a physical artifact. A compact, oval locket, tarnished silver, on a broken chain. With trembling fingers, she pried the delicate clasp open.
Inside were two tiny photographs, faded to sepia. One was of a young, smiling Lily Bright, her hair a pale cloud. The other was a man. He was handsome, with a strong jaw and dark hair swept back from his forehead. He was not in shepherd’s garb, but in a smart shirt and jacket. On the reverse of his photo, in minute, faded ink, were the initials: A.R.
Alistair Reed.
Eleanor Vance slumped into a kitchen chair, the locket cool and heavy in her palm. This was no longer just coded words in a margin. This was proof. Proof that Lily had known him, perhaps cared for him. Proof that Agatha had found it and hidden it away. A wolf.
The wind howled outside, rattling the latch of the back door. The storm was reaching its peak. Eleanor Vance wave of exhaustion wash over her. The day's events - the fear, the hostility, the discovery - had taken a toll on her. She carefully placed the locket on the kitchen table, deciding to lock it in Agatha's writing desk in the morning. For now, she needed rest.
She climbed the stairs, the image of the locket still in her mind. The rain pounded against the roof. She fell into a restless sleep, where she dreamed of people in aprons and boots moving through fog, and notes on paper blowing in the wind.
She woke up with a start, hours later. The storm had passed, and an eerie silence had fallen over the village. But something off.Hints off unease pulled her awake. The air in the cottage seemed different, not warmer or colder, but unsettled.
She received out of bed, put on her dressing gown, and crept downstairs. The moon was shining through the kitchen window, casting a faint light.
The sight that greeted her took her breath away.
The back door, which she had locked before going to bed, was slightly open. A chill ran through her as she saw that all of Agatha's cookbooks had been pulled from the shelves. They were scattered across the floor, their pages open and their spines broken. The careful order that Agatha had created was now in disarray.
But that was not the worst part.
The silver locket she had left on the kitchen table was gone. In its place was a freshly baked scone, torn in half and stabbed with a kitchen knife. A note was attached to the scone, written in a handwriting she didn't recognize. The note read: "Stop digging in my garden."

Eleanor Vance approached the table, her heart frozen with fear.
