Chapter 8: Burying the Past

Chapter 8: Burying the Past

The rain had settled into a soft, persistent drizzle, the kind that polished the cobblestones of St. Bede’s churchyard to a slick pewter sheen and drew a rich, petrichor scent from the ancient yew trees. Eleanor stood under the lychgate, its oak blackened with age and moisture, and watched the water trace silver paths down the grotesque faces of the gargoyles. The church, a squat Norman structure with a stubborn, square tower, seemed to hunker down into the earth, keeping its secrets close.

Her visit was officially to examine the parish archives for her aunt’s collection—a perfectly reasonable, even commendable, activity for the niece of Agatha Lively. Unofficially, she was there to dig a grave for a reputation.

The interior was a pocket of hushed, dusty warmth. The air smelled of beeswax, old paper, and the faint, ghostly echo of hymn books. Mrs. Penelope Thistlethwaite, the churchwarden, was a small, bird-like woman with spectacles perched on the end of her nose, who moved with a rustling efficiency.

“The archives, dear? Oh, yes, Agatha did so love poking about in them. Mostly baptismal records and harvest festival minutes, I’m afraid. Nothing too thrilling.” She led Eleanor to a small, windowless room off the vestry, lined with sagging wooden shelves. “The Reverend Croft boxes are on the top shelf there. He was our vicar from 1958 to 1982. A pillar. An absolute pillar.”

Eleanor thanked her, and as Mrs. Thistlethwaite’s footsteps receded, she was left alone with the silence and the dust motes dancing in the beam of a single, bare bulb.

The Reverend Alban Croft’s legacy was meticulously ordered. Sermons on moral fortitude, letters to the parish council about the upkeep of the graveyard, minutes from the Women’s Institute meetings where he’d given the blessing. It was the portrait of a benign, slightly dull shepherd. Then, in a ledger marked Youth Fellowship & Outreach, 1969-1975, she found a different thread.

He had organized outings. Not just to the seaside or museums, but weekend camping trips to the Lake District, hiking expeditions along the coastal path. The lists of attendees were in his neat, clerical hand. Mostly boys, a few girls. Lily’s name appeared twice, in ’71 and ’72. Lily Wetherby, parental consent granted. The trips were noted as triumphs of community spirit. But the frequency was intense, the planning obsessive. It spoke of a need for control, for removal. A shepherd taking his flock far from the village gaze.

Her fingers were grey with dust when she emerged an hour later. The choir was practicing in the nave—a faltering rendition of “For the Beauty of the Earth.” The singers were mostly elderly, their voices a fragile, beautiful latticework of sound. After they finished, Eleanor approached, offering compliments and her now-familiar cover story.

“Aunt Agatha was particularly interested in the social history of the village in the sixties and seventies,” she said, offering a tin of shortbread she’d brought as a bribe. “The church must have been the heart of it all.”

It opened a floodgate of reminiscence: jumble sales, Christmas pantomimes, the terrible year the harvest festival pumpkin rolled down the aisle. Eleanor listened, smiling, until she gently steered the conversation.

“What about Reverend Croft? He seems to have been a dynamo.”

A comfortable, nodding agreement rippled through the group. Then an old man with a shock of white hair and a fisherman’s knit sweater, introduced as Walter, gave a soft, dry cough.

“A dynamo, yes. A saint, they say now.” He took a bite of shortbread, chewing thoughtfully. “Had a temper on him, though. Oh, it was righteous anger, he’d call it. If a lad’s hair was too long, or a girl’s skirt too short for the choir… he’d go purple. A fixation on purity, he had. Could be cruel with his tongue, under the steeple.”

The other choristers shifted, their fond smiles tightening slightly. One woman patted Walter’s arm. “Now, Walt, he was a man of his time. High standards.”

“High standards don’t make a child cry for forgetting a verse,” Walter murmured, and said no more.

The word fixation hung in the air, sharper than the scent of wax. Eleanor left the church with it ringing in her ears, a dissonant chord in the hymn of Croft’s perfection.

Back at The Marmalade Manuscript, the shop felt like a sanctuary. The bell’s jingle was a welcome home. She needed grounding, something tactile. Agatha’s recipe box, a wooden chest smelling of cardamom and vanilla, called to her. Perhaps the answer wasn’t in ledgers, but in legacy. In something sweet.

She flipped through the cards in Agatha’s looping script: Sticky Toffee Pudding, Rosewater Biscuits, Blackberry & Apple Crumble. Then, Gingerbread (Rev. Croft’s Favorite). Her heart gave a little thump. The recipe was standard: molasses, ginger, cinnamon. But in the margin, in a different, tighter ink—Agatha’s investigative hand—was a note.

“He said the secret was in the lure. The sweetness used to lure. Not treacle, but attention. A listening ear. A special invitation. ‘For the purest lambs,’ he told me once, smiling. The ginger is to hide the bitterness.”

A coded note. Not about baking, but about methodology. The sweetness used to lure. The outings. The special attention. Lily, a lonely girl from a troubled home, would have been the perfect lamb.

The drizzle had stopped, leaving the world washed and gleaming. Eleanor walked to the post office, the village hub where old news was traded like currency. Mabel behind the counter was polishing her spectacles.

“Afternoon, Eleanor. Still on the history trail?”

“I am,” Eleanor said, buying a stamp she didn’t need. “It’s the human stories that are so elusive. I heard a sad one about a girl called Lily Wetherby. Vanished.”

Mabel’s face softened. “Oh, poor Lily. A lovely thing, but flighty. That was a bad business.”

“Did anyone see her that night? Sometimes the smallest detail in an old story can bring it to life for the collection.”

Mabel put her spectacles on, looking past Eleanor to the wet street. “Well. Old Ned Burgess, God rest him, was night-fishing for eels down by Miller’s Bend. Came in here the next day white as a sheet when he heard she was missing. Said he’d seen her, near midnight. Not alone.”

Eleanor held her breath. “No?”

“Argueing, he said she was. With a tall man. A tall man in a long, dark coat. Ned said it looked like it flowed right down to his ankles in the moonlight. He thought it was a lover’s tiff, didn’t want to intrude. By the time the news broke… well, he was afraid. Afraid of pointing fingers.”

“A long coat,” Eleanor repeated, her mouth dry.

“Like a vicar’s cassock, Ned said later. But he took that back quick. Wouldn’t say another word about it.”

The description settled over Eleanor like a shroud. A ceremonial cassock. Reverend Croft was famously tall, over six feet two. The pillar of the community. The man with the temper, the fixation on purity, who organized lonely outings. Who had lured.

The pieces were there, a grim mosaic. But a mosaic wasn’t proof. It was a story. Agatha’s first clue, the one hidden in the Keats, pointed to the river. ‘Where the weeping willow kisses its own reflection, and the kingfisher waits in vain.’ There was only one willow that dramatic on the river, at the secluded curve of Miller’s Bend.

As evening drew in, painting the sky in watercolour washes of mauve and apricot, Eleanor pulled on her wellington boots and an old waxed coat. She felt a tremor in her hands, a cold certainty in her gut. This was no longer a historical puzzle. This was the edge of a grave.

The path to Miller’s Bend was muddy and overgrown. The river here was wide and slow, the sound of its passage a deep, murmuring sigh. The weeping willow was a majestic, tragic creature, its trailing tips brushing the dark water. This was a place of quiet and solitude, far from the village lights.

Her torch beam cut through the twilight, catching on brambles and the startled eyes of a water rat. She searched the base of the willow, the mossy roots that formed little grottoes. Nothing. The note said ‘beneath.’ Not under the tree, but beneath the spot? The bank was a mixture of thick clay and silt, churned by floods and time.

She moved carefully, her boots sinking with unpleasant squelches. She was about to turn back, thinking it futile, when her left foot, taking a step closer to the water’s edge, sank deeper than she expected—up to the ankle. As she struggled to pull it free, there was a soft, subterranean pop, and the mud released its suction with a reluctant gasp.

Staggering back, she shone her torch at the small, dark hole her foot had left. Something glinted in the muck. Not a stone. A small, hard wink of tarnished silver.

Her breath caught. She knelt, the damp seeping through her trousers, and reached into the cool, clinging mud. Her fingers closed around it. She pulled it out and wiped it clean on her coat.

It was a cross. A small, elegant Latin cross, the kind worn on a fine chain by a clergyman. The chain was broken, one link snapped clean. It was heavy for its size, solid silver, worn smooth in places from years of wear. On the back, very faintly engraved, were the initials: A.C.

Alban Croft.

The world narrowed to the cold weight in her palm. The river’s murmur became a roar in her ears. Here it was. Not a document, not a rumour, but a physical, personal object, lost in the mud where Lily Wetherby was last seen arguing with a tall man in a long coat. Had it been torn away in a struggle? Had it simply fallen, unnoticed in the dark, as its owner did something unspeakable?

This was no longer just about Lily. It was about Agatha. Her aunt had found this. She had connected it to the recipe, to the rumours, to the coded note about ‘lures.’ She had hidden her discovery, piece by piece, in her manuscript, knowing the truth was too dangerous to state plainly. The break-in wasn’t about random theft. Someone was still afraid of what Agatha knew. Someone for whom the past was not buried deep enough.

Eleanor clutched the cross, its edges biting into her flesh. She had come to bury the past, but she had only succeeded in unearthing it. And as she stood in the gathering dark by the weeping willow, a new, chilling thought took root: if the reverend’s secret had been worth killing to keep once, what would its guardian do to keep it buried now?

She slipped the cross into her deepest pocket. It felt less like a clue and more like a trigger. Turning her torch off, she let the twilight envelop her. From across the river, she felt a sudden, prickling sensation on the back of her neck—the unmistakable feeling of being watched. A figure, tall and indistinct, stood motionless among the trees on the far bank, silhouetted against the last of the light. Then, as she froze, it melted silently back into the woods, leaving only the shudder of leaves and the cold, accusing weight of silver in her pocket.
