Chapter 4: A Recipe for Riddles

Chapter 4: A Recipe for Riddles

The Honeywick house, in the days that followed, ceased to be a museum of memory and transformed into a workshop of gentle obsession. The musty silence was now punctuated by the rustle of paper, the clink of a teacup set down too hard in excitement, and the low, rhythmic hum Eleanor Vance made when she was thinking, a sound she’d inherited from her mother. The photograph of Lily Bright and her three friends was propped against a jar of dried lavender on the kitchen table, their youthful faces a silent council overseeing the investigation.

Eleanor Vance had spread her tools around her: the Honeywick Hearth & Home cookbook, her own notebook now filled with increasingly frantic scribbles, the local map from the archive, and a plate of shortbread from Mrs. Plum that was slowly disappearing. The initial overwhelm had crystallised into a method. Agatha Vance, the meticulous archivist, had not left chaos. She had left a finding aid, written in the language she and Eleanor Vance shared most deeply: the language of domestic lore.

The breakthrough came with the Victoria Sponge. It was annotated with Agatha’s tight, looping script. The ingredients were straightforward: Flour, Sugar, Butter, Eggs, Raspberry Jam. But the instructions were not.

‘Cream the butter and sugar until the lies are pale and fluffy,’ Agatha had written beside the printed text. ‘Beat in the eggs of curiosity, one at a time, lest the mixture curdle with suspicion. Fold in the flour of fact with a light hand. The jam must be spread only after the layers have cooled, or the truth will seep and be lost.’

Eleanor Vance stared at it, the words swimming. Then, with a jolt, she understood. It wasn’t a code to be broken with ciphers or maths. It was a metaphor. A narrative. The recipes were stories.

She flipped back to the earlier, more heavily annotated sections. The ‘Suspiciously Rich Beef Stew’ now read differently. ‘Begin by browning the shin of beef (the foundation, the victim?). Use a heavy pot. The onions must be softened until translucent—secrets half-revealed. The ‘bitter almonds’ (a dash, no more) add a dangerous depth—beware the one with the cyanide smile.’

Bitter almonds. A person. Someone Agatha, or perhaps Lily before her, had distrusted. Eleanor Vance’s pulse quickened. She turned to a recipe for ‘Secluded Lane Blackberry Cobbler.’ The instructions spoke of ‘picking berries where the brambles are thickest, away from prying eyes. A meeting place? The juice will stain, a permanent mark. Combine with sugar and a squeeze of lemon (a sour note, a warning?) before topping with a plain crust—a disguise.’

It was a map. A logbook. Written in the only diary a post-war housewife might keep that no one would think to examine: her cookbook.

Her focus returned to the photograph. Lily, radiant in the centre. The three friends flanking her. The bold one with the bicycle clips was ‘M.’ The gentle-looking girl with the long braid was ‘R.’ The tall, serious boy with the careful parting was ‘T.S.’

Initials. Could they be matched?

She spent the afternoon cross-referencing the 1956 Honeywick parish newsletter from the archive box. Births, marriages, local gossip. She found a Margaret “Maggie” Shipley winning a prize for dahlias. A Rosamund “Rosie” Bennett singing a solo in the church choir. And a Thomas Sewell, prefect, commended for his essay on local geology.

Maggie, Rosie, Thomas.

The next morning, Eleanor Vance walked into Honeywick with a new purpose. The high street seemed to rearrange itself around her quest. She passed Plum’s Teas and saw Mrs. Plum wave from behind the window, a smudge of flour on her cheek. Next was Bennett’s Haberdashery, its window a rainbow of threads and buttons. An older woman with a kind face and a single, thick grey braid coiled at her nape was arranging a display of lace. Rosamund Bennett. ‘R.’

Eleanor Vance’s destination was at the end of the street: Sewell’s Family Butchers. The window was a still life of crimson and cream, marbled cuts of beef, plump sausages coiled like promises, and a pair of pheasants hanging with iridescent feathers. A bell jangled, a sharp, clear sound, as she stepped inside. The air was cool and carried the clean, mineral scent of fresh meat and sawdust.

Behind the counter stood a man who could only be Thomas Sewell. He was tall, though slightly stooped, as if accustomed to ducking doorframes. His hair was steel-grey, cut short, and his face was a landscape of firm lines and a neatly trimmed moustache. His arms, bare to the elbows, were strong, his hands capable as he sharpened a long knife against a steel with a rhythmic, hissing scrape. He looked up, his eyes a pale, watery blue, and gave a brief, professional nod.

“Morning. What can I do for you?”

His voice was like the sound of the steel on the blade: firm, utilitarian, without unnecessary warmth.

“I’m… just browsing, thank you,” Eleanor Vance said, feeling suddenly foolish. What was she going to ask? Did you kill Lily Bright? She picked up a string of honey-and-herb sausages. “These look wonderful.”

“They are. My own recipe.” He set the knife down. “You’re Agatha Vance’s niece.”

It wasn’t a question. Honeywick’s telegraph wires, it seemed, were in fine working order.

“Yes. Eleanor Vance.”

“Heard you were poking about in the archive.” He began wiping down the already-spotless counter with a damp cloth. “About that old business.”

The directness startled her. “I… found some of my aunt’s things. It piqued my curiosity.”

“Curiosity.” He repeated the word as if it were a cut of meat he was assessing. “A luxury. For some.” He looked at her then, properly, and for a second, Eleanor Vance saw the ghost of the serious boy in the photograph, the weight of prefectship still on his shoulders. “Agatha was curious too. Never let it rest. A stubborn woman.”

There was no malice in it, only a stark statement of fact.

“Did you know her well?” Eleanor Vance ventured.

“Well enough. She came in for her cuts. Preferred the loin, lean. Always asked questions.” He turned to arrange a tray of kidneys. “Not about meat.”

The silence stretched, filled only with the low hum of the refrigerated cabinet. Eleanor Vance gathered her courage. “She left me a photograph. From 1956. You’re in it. With Lily Bright.”

Thomas Sewell went very still. His back was to her, his shoulders tense under his striped butcher’s apron. For a long moment, he didn’t move. Then, slowly, he turned. His face was a careful blank, but his eyes had changed. The pale blue seemed clouded, looking inward.

“A long time ago,” he said, his voice quieter now.

“What was she like?”

He picked up his steel and knife again, but didn’t resume sharpening. He just held them. “Like sunlight on water. You couldn’t catch hold of it. Bright by name, bright by nature. Everyone loved Lily.” He paused. “Almost everyone.”

“What happened to her, Mr. Sewell?”

The blade flashed as he finally set the tools down with a definitive clatter. “That,” he said, meeting her gaze squarely, “is what your aunt spent decades trying to find out. And a good many others before her. The police. Reporters. It leads nowhere but to dust and heartache. Some stones are better left unturned, Miss Vance. They’ve mossed over. Let them be.”

The finality in his tone was a wall. Eleanor Vance paid for her sausages, the coins feeling absurdly loud on the counter. As the bell jangled her exit, she felt his eyes on her back, a steady, heavy weight.

Back at Plum’s Teas for lunch, Eleanor Vance was quiet, pushing a fork through Mrs. Plum’s exquisite leek and potato pie.

“Penny for them, dear?” Mrs. Plum asked, refilling her teacup without being asked. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“I think I just did,” Eleanor Vance murmured. “Or at least, the keeper of one.” She told her about the visit to Sewell’s, about his stony demeanour and his cryptic warning.

Mrs. Plum listened, her head tilted like a sympathetic sparrow. When Eleanor Vance finished, she sighed, a soft, doughy sound. “Ah, Thomas. He was never the same, you know. After.”

“After Lily vanished?”

Mrs. Plum nodded, leaning in conspiratorially, the scent of vanilla and cinnamon wafting from her. “They were sweethearts, for a time. That summer. It was the talk of the town, in a gentle way. Lily, so full of fire and fun, and Thomas, so steady and serious. Like a sparrow trying to court a hummingbird. But he adored her. You could see it in the way he looked at her, even from across the street. Then… poof. She was gone. It near broke him. He closed up. Took over his dad’s shop, buried himself in the work. Never married. Still lives in the flat above the butcher’s. He’s the best butcher in three counties, but a piece of him got lost in ’56, I reckon.”

The information settled in Eleanor Vance’s stomach, heavier than the pie. A sweetheart. A person with powerful emotions tied to Lily. Hope, love, and then, devastating loss. And potentially, a powerful motive. Agatha’s annotation—‘bitter almonds’—flashed in her mind.

That evening, back in Agatha’s kitchen, Eleanor Vance approached the cookbook with this new, poignant lens. She looked for recipes that might involve Thomas. ‘Steak and Kidney Pie’—had Agatha noted anything about ‘offal’ or ‘hard muscle’? She found a recipe for ‘Silence of the Lambs’ Mint Sauce’ that made her shiver, but it was in a later, less certain hand.

Her focus returned to the marmalade recipe, the one that had started it all. She read it aloud, slowly, trying to hear Agatha’s voice in the words.

‘For Seville Orange Marmalade: A Bitter-Sweet Preservation.’

‘Ingredients: The fruit of discovery (sharp), the sugar of hope, the water of time.’

‘Method: Pierce the skin of the past to release the pips of truth. They hold the gel, the substance that will set the whole. Simmer long and slow; patience is the only fuel. The scum that rises must be skimmed away—these are the lies, the distractions. Test for set on a cold plate—the past must be cool to judge clearly. Pot into sterilised jars, seal tightly. Memory, once preserved, must be kept safe.’

And then, the final, typed line, the one that had hooked her days ago. She had read it before, but now, with the context of Thomas, of Maggie and Rosie waiting to be approached, of the entire, humming map of Honeywick laid out in culinary terms, it resonated with a profound, clear note.

‘For truth to set, it must be poured while hot. Find the jar in the usual place.’

It was an instruction. Not a metaphor, but a direct, physical instruction from Agatha. Find the jar. The marmalade jar. The actual jar.

But which one? The pantry in Honeywick house had a shelf dedicated to Agatha’s preserves: jams, chutneys, pickles, all neatly labelled and dated. Eleanor Vance had admired them, even eaten some of the strawberry. But ‘the usual place’? What was usual for Agatha?

Eleanor Vance thought of her aunt’s archival mind. Order. Logic. A place for everything. The ‘usual place’ for a crucial document wouldn’t be randomly among others. It would be separate, significant.

She went to the pantry, her heart thumping. The shelf of preserves glowed in the soft light, jewels of amber, ruby, and emerald. She scanned the labels: Blackcurrant ’89, Damson ’91, Piccalilli ’93… All years after Lily’s disappearance. All years after Agatha had begun her investigation.

Then her eyes fell on it. Not on the main shelf, but on the top shelf, alone, pushed slightly back. A jar with no fancy label, just a piece of plain brown paper tied with string around the lid. She had to stand on tiptoe on a stool to reach it. She lifted it down. It was full of a dark, amber marmalade, the shreds of peel suspended within like tiny, suspended slivers of sunset. It was dusty. And it was the only one of its kind.

Her hands trembled as she carried it to the kitchen table. She untied the rough string, the paper brittle with age. The lid resisted, then gave with a soft, vacuum-sealed pop. The scent that rose was incredible—not just the bright, bitter-orange of marmalade, but deeper, spicier. She peered inside. The marmalade looked normal, if a little darker than usual.

‘Find the jar.’

She got a long-handled spoon and carefully probed the thick, sticky contents. Halfway down, the spoon met resistance. Something solid. Her breath caught. She hooked it, lifted it slowly, a gooey, amber-coated lump emerging. She lowered it onto a sheet of greaseproof paper.

Under the warm tap, the marmalade melted away, revealing a small, cylindrical object. She dried it gently. It was a tin, the kind that held breath mints or small pills, sealed with a tight-fitting lid. It was old, the colourful paper label long since washed away by time and citrus.

With nervous fingers, she pried the lid off.

Inside, protected from the decades by beeswax paper and the perfect seal of sweet, acidic preserve, was not a note, but a key. A small, old-fashioned, barrel-shaped key. And with it, a single, faded photograph, smaller than the others.

It showed a section of stone wall, overgrown with ivy. In the centre of the wall, partially obscured by the leaves, was a carved symbol. It looked like a stylised ‘B’ intertwined with a sheaf of wheat. And beneath the photo, in Agatha’s now-familiar hand, was written a single, chilling line:

‘He built a door where the wall was blank. Lily found it.’

The kitchen clock ticked loudly in the sudden, profound silence. The key lay in her palm, cold and heavy with implication. The usual place. Not just for marmalade, but for hiding the things that were too hot, too dangerous, to be left to cool. Agatha had poured the truth here, and sealed it shut for Eleanor Vance to find.

The hook was no longer a line on a page. It was a cold, metallic weight in her hand, and a door in a wall she had yet to find. Somewhere in Honeywick, a blank wall had a door. And Lily Bright had found it on a summer’s day in 1956.
