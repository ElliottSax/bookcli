Chapter 4: A Recipe for Riddles

Chapter 4: A Recipe for Riddles

The Honeywick house, in the days that followed, ceased to be a museum of memory and transformed into a workshop of gentle obsession. The musty silence was now punctuated by the rustle of paper, the clink of a teacup set down too hard in excitement, and the low, rhythmic hum Eleanor Vance made when she was thinking, a sound she’d inherited from her mother. The photograph of Lily Bright and her three friends was propped against a jar of dried lavender on the kitchen table, their youthful faces a silent council overseeing the investigation.
Eleanor Vance had spread her tools around her: the Honeywick Hearth & Home cookbook, her own notebook now filled with increasingly frantic scribbles, the local map from the archive, and a plate of shortbread from Mrs. Plum that was slowly disappearing. The initial overwhelm had crystallised into a method. Agatha Vance, the meticulous archivist, had not left chaos. She had left a finding aid, written in the language she and Eleanor Vance shared most deeply: the language of domestic lore.
The breakthrough came with the Victoria Sponge. It was annotated with Agatha’s tight, looping script. The ingredients were straightforward: Flour, Sugar, Butter, Eggs, Raspberry Jam. But the instructions were not.
‘Cream the butter and sugar until the lies are pale and fluffy,’ Agatha had written beside the printed text. ‘Beat in the eggs of curiosity, one at a time, lest the mixture curdle with suspicion. Fold in the flour of fact with a light hand. The jam must be spread only after the layers have cooled, or the truth will seep and be lost.’

Eleanor Vance stared at it, the words swimming. Then, with a jolt, she understood. It wasn’t a code to be broken with ciphers or maths. It was a metaphor. A narrative. The recipes were stories.
She flipped back to the earlier, more heavily annotated sections. The ‘Suspiciously Rich Beef Stew’ now read differently. ‘Begin by browning the shin of beef (the foundation, the victim?). Use a heavy pot. The onions must be softened until translucent—secrets half-revealed. The ‘bitter almonds’ (a dash, no more) add a dangerous depth—beware the one with the cyanide smile.’

Bitter almonds. A person. Someone Agatha, or perhaps Lily before her, had distrusted. Eleanor Vance’s pulse quickened. She turned to a recipe for ‘Secluded Lane Blackberry Cobbler.’ The instructions spoke of ‘picking berries where the brambles are thickest, away from prying eyes. A meeting place? The juice will stain, a permanent mark. Combine with sugar and a squeeze of lemon (a sour note, a warning?) before topping with a plain crust—a disguise.’

It was a map. A logbook. Written in the only diary a post-war housewife might keep that no one would think to examine: her cookbook.
Her focus returned to the photograph. Lily, radiant in the centre. The three friends flanking her. The bold one with the bicycle clips was ‘M.’ The gentle-looking girl with the long braid was ‘R.’ The tall, serious boy with the careful parting was ‘T.S.’

Initials. Could they be matched?
She spent the afternoon cross-referencing the 1956 Honeywick parish newsletter from the archive box. Births, marriages, local gossip. She found a Margaret “Maggie” Shipley winning a prize for dahlias. A Rosamund “Rosie” Bennett singing a solo in the church choir. And a Thomas Sewell, prefect, commended for his essay on local geology.
Maggie, Rosie, Thomas.
The next morning, Eleanor Vance walked into Honeywick with a new purpose. The high street appeared to rearrange itself around her quest. She passed Plum’s Teas and saw Mrs. Plum wave from behind the window, a smudge of flour on her cheek. Next was Bennett’s Haberdashery, its window a rainbow of threads and buttons. An older woman with a kind face and a single, thick grey braid coiled at her nape was arranging a display of lace. Rosamund Bennett. ‘R.’

Eleanor Vance’s destination was at the end of the street: Sewell’s Family Butchers. The window was a still life of crimson and cream, marbled cuts of beef, plump sausages coiled like promises, and a pair of pheasants hanging with iridescent feathers. A bell jangled, a sharp, clear sound, as she stepped inside. The air was cool and carried the clean, mineral scent of fresh meat and sawdust.
Behind the counter stood a man who could only be Thomas Sewell. He was tall, though slightly stooped, as if accustomed to ducking doorframes. His hair was steel-grey, cut short, and his face was a landscape of firm lines and a neatly trimmed moustache. His arms, bare to the elbows, were strong, his hands capable as he sharpened a long knife against a steel with a rhythmic, hissing scrape. He looked up, his eyes a pale, watery blue, and gave a brief, professional nod.
“Morning. What can I do for you?”

His voice was like the sound of the steel on the blade: firm, utilitarian, without unnecessary warmth.
“I’m… just browsing, thank you,” Eleanor Vance said, feeling foolish. What was she going to ask? Did you kill Lily Bright? She picked up a string of honey-and-herb sausages. “These look wonderful.”

“They are. My own recipe.” He set the knife down. “You’re Agatha Vance’s niece.”

It wasn’t a question. Honeywick’s telegraph wires, it seemed, were in fine working order.
“Yes. Eleanor Vance.”

“Heard you were poking about in the archive.” He began wiping down the already-spotless counter with a damp cloth. “About that old business.”

The directness startled her. “I… found some of my aunt’s things. It piqued my curiosity.”

“Curiosity.” He repeated the word as if it were a cut of meat he was assessing. “A luxury. For some.” He looked at her then, properly, and for a second, Eleanor Vance saw the ghost of the serious boy in the photograph, the weight of prefectship still on his shoulders. “Agatha was curious too. Never let it rest. A stubborn woman.”

There was no malice in it, only a stark statement of fact.
“Did you know her well?” Eleanor Vance ventured.
“Well enough. She came in for her cuts. Preferred the loin, lean. Always asked questions.” He turned to arrange a tray of kidneys. “Not about meat.”

The silence stretched, filled only with the low hum of the refrigerated cabinet. Eleanor Vance gathered her courage. “She left me a photograph. From 1956. You’re in it. With Lily Bright.”

Thomas Sewell went very still. His back was to her, his shoulders tense under his striped butcher’s apron. For a long moment, he didn’t move. Then, slowly, he turned. His face was a careful blank, but his eyes had changed. The pale blue seemed clouded, looking inward.
“A long time ago,” he said, his voice quieter now.
“What was she like?”

He picked up his steel and knife again, but didn’t resume sharpening. He just held them. “Like sunlight on water. You couldn’t catch hold of it. Bright by name, bright by nature. Everyone loved Lily.” He paused. “Almost everyone.”

“What happened to her, Mr. Sewell?”

The blade flashed as he finally set the tools down with a definitive clatter. “That,” he replied, meeting her gaze squarely, “is what your aunt spent decades trying to find out. And a good many others before her. The police. Reporters. It leads nowhere but to dust and heartache. Some stones are better left unturned, Miss Vance. They’ve mossed over. Let them be.”

The finality in his tone was a wall. Eleanor Vance paid for her sausages, the coins feeling absurdly loud on the counter. As the bell jangled her exit, she his eyes on her back, a steady, heavy weight.
Back at Plum’s Teas for lunch, Eleanor Vance was quiet, pushing a fork through Mrs. Plum’s exquisite leek and potato pie.
“Penny for them, dear?” Mrs. Plum asked, refilling her teacup without being asked. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“I think I simply did,” Eleanor Vance murmured. “Or at least, the keeper of one.” She told her about the visit to Sewell’s, about his stony demeanour and his cryptic warning.
Mrs. Plum listened, her head tilted like a sympathetic sparrow. When Eleanor Vance finished, she sighed, a soft, doughy sound. “Ah, Thomas. He was never the same, you know. After.”

“After Lily vanished?”

Mrs. Plum nodded, leaning in conspiratorially, the scent of vanilla and cinnamon wafting from her. “They were swee the arts, for a time. That summer. It was the talk of the town, in a gentle way. Lily, so full of fire and fun, and Thomas, so steady and serious. Like a sparrow trying to court a hummingbird. But he adored her. You could see it in the way he glanced at her, even from across the street. Then… poof. She was gone. It near broke him. He closed up. Took over his dad’s shop, buried himself in the work. Never married. Still lives in the flat above the butcher’s. He’s the best butcher in three counties, but a piece of him got lost in ’56, I reckon.”

The information settled in Eleanor Vance’s stomach, heavier than the pie. A sweetheart. A person with powerful emotions tied to Lily. Hope, love, and then, devastating loss. And potentially, a powerful motive. Agatha’s annotation—‘bitter almonds’—flashed in her mind.
That evening, back in Agatha’s kitchen, Eleanor Vance approached the cookbook with this new, poignant lens. She looked for recipes that might involve Thomas. ‘Steak and Kidney Pie’—had Agatha noted anything about ‘offal’ or ‘hard muscle’? She found a recipe for ‘Silence of the Lambs’ Mint Sauce’ that made her shiver, but it was in a later, less certain hand.
Her focus returned to the marmalade recipe, the one that had started it all. She read it aloud, slowly, trying to hear Agatha’s voice in the words.
‘For Seville Orange Marmalade: A Bitter-Sweet Preservation.’

‘Ingredients: The fruit of discovery (sharp), the sugar of hope, the water of time.’

To uncover the truth, you need to examine the past carefully. The key to understanding lies in the details, which will come together to form a complete picture. This process requires patience, as you need to let things develop slowly. As you work through the past, you'll encounter things that are misleading or false - these need to be set aside. To get a clear view, you must approach the past with a calm and level head. Once you've clarified the truth, you need to preserve it safely.
The final line of text, which had initially caught her attention, now made sense in the context of Thomas, Maggie, and Rosie, and the entire layout of Honeywick. The words resonated deeply with her.
‘For truth to set, it must be poured while hot. Find the jar in the usual place.’

This was a direct instruction from Agatha, not a figure of speech. Eleanor needed to find a specific jar - the marmalade jar.
However, there were many jars in the pantry at Honeywick house, all filled with Agatha's preserves and labelled with their contents and dates. Eleanor had tried some of the strawberry jam, but she was looking for something specific. The phrase "the usual place" implied that Agatha had a particular spot in mind.
Eleanor thought about her aunt's organised mind and how she liked things to be in order. If Agatha had hidden something important, it wouldn't be mixed in with other items. It would be in a separate, significant location.
Eleanor's heart was racing as she went to the pantry. The preserves on the shelf sparkled in the soft light, with their colourful labels and dates. She scanned the labels, noticing that they were all from years after Lily's disappearance, when Agatha had started investigating. Then she saw it - a jar on the top shelf, set back from the others. It had a plain brown paper label tied with string, and it was the only one of its kind.
She had to stand on a stool to reach it, and as she lifted it down, she feelings of excitement. The jar was dusty, and it contained a dark, amber-coloured marmalade with suspended shreds of peel. As she carried it to the kitchen table, her hands trembled.
She untied the string and removed the paper label, which was brittle with age. The lid was difficult to open, but eventually it arrived off with a soft pop. The scent that rose from the jar was intense - not just the smell of marmalade, but also deeper, spicier notes.
She peered into the jar and saw that the marmaladegazedd normal, although it was a bit darker than usual. She used a long-handled spoon to probe the contents, and halfway down, she encountered something solid. Her breath caught as she realised she had found something.
She carefully lifted out the object, which was coated in marmalade. Under the warm tap, the marmalade melted away, revealing a small, cylindrical tin. It was old, with a washed-away label. She dried it gently and pried off the lid.
Inside, she found a small, old-fashioned key and a faded photograph. The photo showed a section of stone wall covered in ivy, with a carved symbol in the centre - a stylised letter "B" intertwined with a sheaf of wheat. Beneath the photo, Agatha had written a single, chilling line:

‘He built a door where the wall was blank. Lily found it.’

The kitchen clock ticked loudly in the silence that followed. The key cold and heavy in her hand, and she realised that Agatha had hidden the truth in this jar, sealing it away for her to find. The "usual place" was no merely st for marmalade, but for hiding things that were too sensitive or dangerous to be left out. Agatha had poured the truth into this jar, and now Eleanor had found it.
The hook was no longer just a line on a page - it was a cold, metallic weight in her hand, and a door in a wall that she had yet to discover. Somewhere in Honeywick, a blank wall had a door, and Lily Bright had found it on a summer's day in 1956.
