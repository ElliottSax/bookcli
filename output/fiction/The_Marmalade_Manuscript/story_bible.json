Among the clutter of marmalade recipes and ephemera, she uncovers her aunt's secret investigation into the decades-old disappearance of a young girl, Lily. Eleanor's archival skills allow her to decode clues hidden in Agatha's 'marmalade manuscripts'\u2014coded notes in ledgers, poems in hymnals, and patterns in preserved ingredients. The trail points disturbingly towards the village's beloved institution: the rectory, and the family of rectors, the Albrights. As Eleanor pieces together the story, she realizes the current, kindly Reverend Michael Albright is living a life of quiet atonement for the sins of his charismatic, predatory father. The mystery culminates not in a public scandal, but in a private, devastating confrontation in the rectory kitchen, where Eleanor presents her findings and Reverend Albright, in a moment of shattering relief and grief, confesses to a lifetime of guarding his father's dark secret, finally allowing the buried truth of Lily's fate to come to light.",
