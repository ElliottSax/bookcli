Chapter 12: Setting the Truth

The rain that had threatened all week finally broke as Eleanor drove to the vicarage, a gentle, persistent drizzle that turned the lanes to ribbons of dark silver and made the green of the hedgerows almost unbearably vivid. The jar of damson plum jam—a peace offering, or maybe a symbol of shared burden—sat on the passenger seat, wrapped in a checked cloth. Agatha’s notebook, with its final, damning entry, was in her bag. The words seemed to burn through the leather: “He gave her the locket. I saw it. The wolf does not shed his skin, only his conscience.”

Reverend Albright answered the door himself. He looked older than he had on Sunday, the lines on his face not just marks of benign wisdom but grooves of a deep, private weariness. His eyes, usually twinkling behind his spectacles, were dull.

“Miss Swift,” he said, his voice soft. “I had a feeling you might come. Mrs. Plum telephoned. She said you’d… found something.”

“May I come in, Reverend?”

He led her not to his study, but to the small, tidy kitchen at the back of the vicarage. A pot of tea was already steeping under a cosy knitted like a strawberry. The room smelled of lemon polish and digestives. It was the heart of a solitary man’s life, simple and unadorned.

“I’ve come about Agatha Finch,” Eleanor began, placing the notebook on the scrubbed pine table. “And about Lily Bright.”

Eleanor didn’t present it as an accusation, but as a story. She spoke of Agatha’s quiet obsession, her notes on the locket, the pattern of the Reverend’s father’s visits to the bookshop, the hidden poems in the hymnal. She spoke of Thomas, finally giving voice to the memory of a girl in a yellow dress being led into the woods by a man in a dark coat, a man who was a pillar of his world. She didn’t need to theatricalise it; the facts, laid out in that warm kitchen, were dramatic enough.

When she finished, the only sound was the ticking of a wall clock and the soft patter of rain against the window. Reverend Albright had removed his spectacles and was polishing them methodically with a handkerchief.

“My father,” he said finally, the words seeming to cost him great effort, “was a man of formidable charisma. And formidable darkness. The village adored him. He had a voice like melted honey and could quote scripture to make you feel the breath of heaven on your neck.” He looked up, his naked eyes vulnerable and sad. “I loved him. And I was terrified of him. His temper was… biblical. It was confined to words, always words, but they could flay you to the bone.”

He took a shaky sip of tea. “I knew he had… infatuations. I turned a blind eye. It was the way of things, then. A pastoral flaw, one whispered about but never confronted. But Lily…” His voice cracked. “She was different. She was light itself. I saw him watching her. I saw the p
