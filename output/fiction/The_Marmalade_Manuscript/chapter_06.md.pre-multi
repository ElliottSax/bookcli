Chapter 6: Sweet Talk and Sour Notes

Chapter 6: Sweet Talk and Sour Notes

The scent of damp earth and cold petals greeted Eleanor as she pushed open the door of ‘Betty’s Blooms’. The little florist’s shop was a cave of colour in the grey drizzle of the afternoon, a humid sanctuary filled with the heady perfume of lilies and the peppery tang of chrysanthemums. Behind a counter littered with green tape and snipped stems stood Betty Finch, a woman who seemed to have been cultivated from the same delicate stock as her flowers. She was small, with fine, anxious features and hands that fluttered like startled birds as she wired a spray of baby’s breath.

“Miss Finch? I’m Eleanor Swift, Agatha’s niece,” Eleanor began, her voice soft, trying not to startle her.

“Oh! Yes. You called.” Betty’s eyes, the pale blue of forget-me-nots, darted to Eleanor and then away. “Terrible about Agatha. A lovely woman. Always bought a pot of rosemary for remembrance, every Sunday after church.” She snipped a stem with a sharp, definitive click.

“Thank you. I’m trying to piece together some of her… local history work. She mentioned you were a friend of Lily Bright’s.”

The name acted like a sudden frost. Betty’s hands stilled. The shop seemed to hold its breath, the only sound the soft drip-drip of water from a hanging basket of ferns. “Lily,” Betty repeated, the word barely a whisper. “That was a lifetime ago.”

“I’ve been reading some of the old village newsletters,” Eleanor pressed gently, leaning on the counter. The wood was cool and slightly sticky with sap. “She seemed so full of life. I wondered what she was like, as a friend.”

Betty’s gaze fixed on a bucket of deep red roses. “Vivacious. That’s the word they always used, wasn’t it? And she was. Like a sunbeam. Wherever Lily was, it was brighter, louder… warmer.” A faint, ghost of a smile touched her lips. “She could talk a magpie out of its silver. Got me to climb the old oak by the millpond once, to see a nest. I was terrified. She just laughed.”

“It must have been awful when she disappeared.”

The fluttering hands resumed, busying themselves with organising already-organised ribbons. “It was like the sun went out. For all of us. The questions, the policemen in their heavy boots… it was dreadful. We were just girls.” Her voice had tightened, becoming thin and reedy. “I don’t really remember much else. It’s all a blur, you see. A sad, grey blur.”

Eleanor sensed a wall, meticulously constructed over decades, covered in the creeping ivy of forced forgetfulness. “Did Agatha ever talk to you about her? In recent years?”

“Agatha asked. Once or twice. I told her the same. Some chapters are best left closed.” Betty finally looked at Eleanor, her expression pleading. “The past can be a bitter root, Miss Swift. It doesn’t always bear repeating. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a funeral wreath to prepare. The Coombes service is tomorrow.”

The dismissal was clear, wrapped in the sombre duty of death. Eleanor bought a small bunch of snowdrops—a gesture of thanks, or perhaps apology—and stepped back out into the drizzle. Betty’s fear was palpable, a living thing in that fragrant room. It wasn’t just grief; it was a nervous, cultivated avoidance. A bitter root.

Robert Miller, the third friend, offered no root at all, bitter or otherwise. A visit to the village hall records, helpd by a curious Mrs. Pembroke, confirmed it: Robert Arthur Miller, emigrated to Perth, Australia, in October 1957, a little over a year after Lily vanished. The entry was neat, final. A full stop. Eleanor copied the scant details, the date humming with significance. He left. Was it grief, or something else?

Her next stop was the butcher’s. ‘T. Croft & Son’ was a temple of carnality, with gleaming white tiles and the rich, metallic scent of fresh blood. Thomas Croft was a man built like one of his own prize hams: broad, solid, with thick forearms and a face that had been seasoned by years of wind and judgement. He looked up from sharpening a long, wicked-looking knife on a steel, the sound a harsh, rhythmic shush-shush-shush.

“Help you?” he grunted.

Eleanor launched into her now-practised spiel about village history. At the mention of Lily Bright, the sharpening didn’t pause, but his eyes, small and dark like currants, hardened.

“Lily Bright,” he said, the name a piece of gristle to be spat out. “Haven’t heard that name in a dog’s age. Flighty thing. Always dreaming.”

“You knew her?”

“Everyone knew her. Or thought they did.” He set the knife down with a definitive clatter. “Look, Miss, I’ve a business to run. History’s for books. We live in the present here.”

“Her disappearance must have shaken the village.”

“Lots of things shake villages. Storms. Illness. Foxes in the henhouse.” He picked up a cleaver, his meaning as blunt as the tool. “Some hens wander off. You don’t spend your life looking for them. You mend the fence and get on with it.”

“Did you speak to the police at the time?”

His stare was a physical pressure. “I answered their questions. Told them I’d seen nothing. Because I hadn’t. Now, if you’re not buying, you’re blocking the counter.” He turned his broad back to her, a definitive end to the conversation. The message was clear: Let sleeping dogs lie. But the vehemence suggested the dogs weren’t sleeping; they were growling, just out of sight.

Feeling the sour note of the encounter cling to her, Eleanor decided on a gentler approach. She found old Gerald, the retired postman, on his customary bench by the war memorial, feeding crusts to a hopeful robin. His memory was a famously vast, if slightly jumbled, archive of village life.

“Lily Bright?” he chirped, his face wrinkling into a smile. “Oh, aye. Pretty as a picture. Had a smile for everyone, including the postman. Even for the sourpusses.” He nodded in the general direction of the high street. “She worked in her dad’s shop, you know. The bakery. Always had a floury handprint on her apron.”

“What do you remember about her, Gerald?”

“She had a secret admirer,” he said, leaning in conspiratorially, his breath smelling of peppermints. “Proper romantic, it was. Notes. He’d leave them in the till at the bakery, when she was working. She’d open the till and there it’d be, amongst the shillings and pence. Made her blush like a rose, it did.”

Eleanor’s pulse quickened. “Did you ever see who left them?”

“Oh, no. Sly, that one. Must have slipped them in when she was fetching a loaf from the back, or serving another customer. I saw her find one once. Her face… well.” He sighed, a wistful sound. “Young love. Or so we thought. Then she was gone, and that was that. The notes stopped, of course. Everything stopped.”

A secret admirer. Notes in the till. It was a tiny, tantalising thread. Eleanor thanked Gerald, leaving him with a new packet of digestives from her bag, and walked back to Ivy Cottage, her mind whirring. The coded recipes, Betty’s fear, Thomas’s hostility, and now a clandestine romance. She felt Agatha’s presence strongly, as if her aunt were walking beside her, nodding in quiet encouragement.

Back in the cottage’s warm, silent kitchen, she brewed a pot of strong Darjeeling and pulled out the next recipe in Agatha’s cipher: Scones for a Stormy Afternoon. The instructions were, as always, perfectly normal on the surface: Rub the butter in until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. A light touch is essential. Beware a heavy hand. But the extra notes, written in Agatha’s tight script in the margin, were the key.

‘L. spoke of a new shepherd on the hills. Met in the lane. Charmer. But watchful eyes. Agatha, trust your nose. A wolf in shepherd’s clothing? Check the parish news, summer ’56.’

A wolf in shepherd’s clothing. The phrase sent a chill through Eleanor, despite the steam from her tea. She fetched the box of parish magazines she’d brought from the archive. Summer 1956. She flipped through the yellowed pages—jumble sales, cricket matches, harvest festival notices. And then, in the August edition, she found it: a small announcement. ‘The Parish Council welcomes Mr. Alistair Reed, who has taken up the tenancy of High Pasture Farm and its flock, following the retirement of Mr. Jenkins. We wish him well in his new venture.’

Alistair Reed. The new shepherd. Eleanor stared at the name. Had he been the secret admirer? The wolf? Was he even still here? A quick check of the current parish directory showed no Reed at High Pasture. Another dead end, or a thread to be pulled?

The afternoon had bled into evening, and the cottage was filled with deep, velvety shadows. The stormy afternoon had indeed arrived, with rain now lashing the windows. Eleanor decided to enact the second part of Agatha’s scone recipe—the ‘light touch’ instruction. She went to the pantry, to the specific canister of flour Agatha had always used. Dipping her hand in, she felt past the fine powder, her fingers brushing the smooth ceramic sides until they found it: a small, oilcloth pouch, tucked right at the bottom.

Her heart hammered against her ribs. She pulled it out, wiping flour from its surface. Inside was not a recipe, but a physical artifact. A small, oval locket, tarnished silver, on a broken chain. With trembling fingers, she pried the delicate clasp open.

Inside were two tiny photographs, faded to sepia. One was of a young, smiling Lily Bright, her hair a pale cloud. The other was a man. He was handsome, with a strong jaw and dark hair swept back from his forehead. He was not in shepherd’s garb, but in a smart shirt and jacket. On the reverse of his photo, in minute, faded ink, were the initials: A.R.

Alistair Reed.

Eleanor slumped into a kitchen chair, the locket cool and heavy in her palm. This was no longer just coded words in a margin. This was proof. Proof that Lily had known him, perhaps cared for him. Proof that Agatha had found it and hidden it away. A wolf.

The wind howled outside, rattling the latch of the back door. The storm was reaching its peak. Fatigue, profound and sudden, washed over Eleanor. The emotional weight of the day—the fear, the hostility, the discovery—felt immense. She placed the locket carefully on the kitchen table, deciding to lock it in Agatha’s writing desk first thing in the morning. For now, she needed sleep.

She climbed the stairs, the locket’s image burning behind her eyes. The rain was a constant drumroll on the slates. She fell into a fitful sleep, where figures in flour-dusted aprons and muddy boots moved through fog, and notes written on butcher’s paper swirled on the wind.

She woke with a start, hours later. The storm had passed. An absolute, dripping silence had settled over the village. But something was wrong. A deep, instinctive sense of violation pulled her fully awake. The air in the cottage felt different. Not warmer or colder, but… disturbed.

She slipped out of bed, pulling on her dressing gown, and crept downstairs. The moon had emerged, casting a weak, silvery light through the kitchen window.

The sight that met her stole the breath from her lungs.

The back door, which she had locked and bolted before going to bed, was standing slightly ajar. A sliver of the damp, night air whispered through the gap.

And the cookbooks. Every single one of Agatha’s beloved, coded cookbooks had been pulled from their shelves. They lay in a great, sprawling avalanche across the worn flagstones, their pages splayed open like wounded birds, their spines cracked. The careful order, Agatha’s life’s work, had been violently undone.

But that wasn’t the worst of it.

On the kitchen table, where she had left it, the silver locket was gone. In its place, sitting squarely in a pool of moonlight, was a single, fresh scone. It had been torn roughly in half, its interior crumb exposed. And stabbed through its heart with a sharp, flour-dusted kitchen knife, was a note.

Eleanor approached, her blood turned to ice. The note, written in a harsh, unfamiliar hand, contained just five words:

“Stop digging in my garden.”
