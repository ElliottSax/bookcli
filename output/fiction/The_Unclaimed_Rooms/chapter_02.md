Chapter 2: Check-In

A silent electric pod of a taxi glided from the curb, abandoning Maya on the cracked sidewalk beneath the bruised plum sky of early evening. 214 Maple Street. The address was a fossil, a piece of her own bone structure worn by a stranger.

Her house, and yet not. The skeleton remained: the broad, welcoming porch, the gabled attic window that had hidden her diaries, the sugar maple now strung with delicate solar-powered fairy lights. But the skin was all wrong. Flawless “Heritage Grey” had replaced the peeling white paint the color of old teeth. A solid, dark-stained door with a discreet, glowing keypad now stood where the screen door used to slam like a firecracker. Gone was the hydrangea bush her mother had nursed for a decade, supplanted by symmetrical boxwoods in sleek steel planters. Digital remastering had transformed Harrow's Creek.

Beside her, the small, hard-shelled suitcase sat like a beetle. Static buzzed beneath her skin. Numbness from the flight and the ride through a town of sleek glass cubes and hollowed-out shells began to crackle at the edges, letting in a cold, sharp air.

Fumbling thumbs brought out her phone, opening the Chronos Stays app. The booking waited: The Lawson Residence – Authentic 90s Nostalgia Experience. 3 Nights. Guest: Maya P. The ‘P’, her mother’s maiden name, was a last-minute lie. She couldn’t bear to give them her real one. A notification blinked: Your keycode is ready. Welcome home. The phrase landed with small, precise violence.

Up the porch steps she climbed, steps that no longer creaked in their familiar, musical sequence. They were silent, solid. The keypad awaited. Six digits: 1-9-9-6. The year she’d turned ten. The year, presumably, this “experience” was pinned to. A soft beep, a green light, a heavy thunk as the lock disengaged. No key, no turning, no weight of metal in her palm. Just algorithmic permission.

The door swung inward onto a wall of scent. Not the complex symphony of home—Murphy’s Oil Soap, simmering garlic, her father’s secret clove tobacco, the damp-dog smell of old books. This was a single, dominant note: “Clean Linen.” Aggressive in its sterility, it was a scent manufactured to evoke a memory of a memory. It smelled of nothing.

A step inside, and the door hissed shut behind her.

In the foyer, a museum diorama had taken root. A garishly bright rug depicting Pac-Man and ghosts smothered the parquet floor her parents had painstakingly refinished. Faux-wood paneling covered the walls where faded floral paper had been stripped. A landline phone with a coiled cord sat on a small table, a prop. Lifting the receiver yielded only dead air, not even a dial tone.

“Hello?” Her voice vanished into the thick, sound-absorbing atmosphere. An unnatural quiet. Their house had been a cacophony: the perpetual hum of the ancient fridge, the furnace’s rumble, tinny radio from her father’s study, her mother’s voice calling up the stairs.

To the left, the living room. Gone was the sagging, forgiving floral sofa. In its place sat a sleek, low-slung modular thing in beige, angled precisely toward a wall-mounted flat screen. On the coffee table, a stack of magazines: Nickelodeon Magazine, Sassy, Nintendo Power. They looked untouched, spines unbroken. One opened to pages crisp and replicated, the crossword blank.

A wave of dizziness crested. Sitting was necessary, but not on that alien sofa. Wheeling her suitcase further in, her heels clicked on the exposed hallway hardwood. Ahead, the kitchen glowed yellow.

And there, centered on the kitchen table with absurd precision, was the bowl.

Her breath hitched. Her mother’s fruit bowl. The heavy, cut-glass one that had always sat on the sideboard, filled with real, slowly-rotting oranges and bananas. Summer light would catch its facets and throw rainbows on the wall. This bowl held fruit too, but wax: apples, grapes, a banana, all gleaming with a perpetual, fake dew. Fingers hovered over a perfect, ruby-red apple. Cold. Hard. Taped discreetly to the underside of the base, a small printed tag: Vintage Replica. Please admire, do not remove.

Her hand snatched back as if burned. A replica. Of course. The real bowl was likely in a landfill, or shattered in some long-ago move. This was a stand-in, an actor playing the part of her past. The quiet rage, a simmering undercurrent since she’d seen the listing, began to boil.

Beside the bowl lay a slim, leather-bound booklet. The Lawson Residence: Memory Lane Guidebook. Stiff fingers opened it.

Welcome, Time Traveler! it began in a cheerful, script-like font. You’ve stepped into a lovingly preserved slice of 1996. To maximize your Authentic Nostalgia Experience, we recommend the following immersion activities:

Morning: Brew a pot of coffee using the retro-style percolator (pods in drawer #2). Enjoy with a bowl of sugary cereal (assorted, cupboard above fridge) while watching Saturday morning cartoon playlists on the curated channel (Channel 1996).
Afternoon: Pretend to do homework at the kitchen table. Pencils and “Trapper Keeper”-style binder provided in desk drawer. For added realism, imagine a parent asking if you’ve finished your chores.
Evening: Unwind with a selection of VHS tapes from our classic collection. Pop some JiffyPop on the stove (fire safety guide on page 23)!

The prose was a sugar-coated razor. Pages flipped under her thumb, her heart a cold, hard stone in her chest. Sections detailed “Period-Appropriate Playlists” (Grunge, Britpop, Bubblegum), a map of “Authentic Local Hangouts” (most of which were now parking lots or condos), and even a “Family Dynamic Role-Play Suggestions” appendix.

Her eyes scanned down to the final entry for the day.

Recommended Evening Activity: Stage a family dinner. Props in cupboard.

The words seemed to pulse on the page. Stage a family dinner. As if it were a community theatre project. From the booklet, her gaze swept the kitchen. It was a perfect replica of a 90s kitchen, all oak veneer and laminate counters, but it held no warmth, no history. Only a curated emptiness.ak cabinets and laminate counters. Too perfect. The stove was a vintage-style range, but its digital display glowed with a soft blue light. The fridge was a sleek Smeg, masquerading in pastel green.

Driven by a morbid, furious curiosity, she walked to the cupboard mentioned. She opened it.

Inside were props. Four identical, bright yellow plastic plates. Four sets of red plastic cutlery. Four plastic cups with cartoon dinosaurs on them. A plastic platter with a fake, glossy roast chicken glued to it, surrounded by immutable plastic peas and carrots. A plastic vase with fabric tulips. It was a dinner set for a dollhouse, a grotesque parody of sustenance and gathering.

She took out the platter. The chicken was a sickly beige, its skin painted a uniform golden brown. It was lighter than it looked, hollow. She held it in her hands, standing in the silent, Clean Linen-scented kitchen, and a sound escaped her—a choked, dry thing that was neither laugh nor sob.

This was what was left. This plastic chicken, this wax fruit, this manual for pretending. Her father’s booming laugh, her mother’s soft singing as she stirred a pot of real stew, the heated debates about politics, the messy, beautiful chaos of a shared life—all of it had been condensed, sanitized, and packaged as an “experience.” A weekend diversion for people who wanted to feel a pang of “simpler times” before returning to their lives of complexity and meaning.

The rage crystallized, cold and sharp. It wasn’t just grief anymore; it was a sense of profound, irredeemable theft. They hadn’t just bought Harrow's Creek; they had exorcised its ghosts and replaced them with puppets.

She dropped the platter back into the cupboard. It landed with a hollow, rattling plastic sound. She needed air that didn’t smell like a corporate laboratory.

Abandoning her suitcase, she walked through the dining room—set with more plastic fare—and into the backyard. The wooden deck was new, composite material that would never splinter. The lawn was an artificial turf, a uniform, springy green. The old oak tree was still there, thank God, but a tasteful, minimalist bench now encircled its base. No swing. The rusted metal swing set that had stood for twenty years was gone.

She sat on the bench, the cold of the metal seeping through her jeans. The sky was fully dark now, a deep indigo. A real moon, at least, hung over the fake grass. From the neighboring houses, she could see the glow of televisions, the silhouettes of people moving in kitchens that were presumably their own. Lives being lived, not staged.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. A notification from the Chronos Stays app. How’s your first hour in the past? Don’t forget to rate your immersion!

She turned the phone off. The silence that descended was absolute, and in it, she could finally hear the echoes. Not the curated ones from the guidebook, but the real ones. The ghost of her own laughter as she chased fireflies right here, where the turf now lay. The murmur of her parents’ voices floating through the screen door on a summer night. The slam of that old screen door as she stormed out at sixteen, vowing never to come back. She’d kept that vow, in a way. She had come back to a simulation.

After a long while, the cold drove her inside. The house felt even more oppressive, a beautiful trap. She dragged her suitcase upstairs, each step on the carpeted stairs too soft, too quiet. The hallway upstairs was lined with framed prints of 90s movie posters: Clueless, Pulp Fiction, Titanic. Her old bedroom door was closed.

She pushed it open.

The room was a shrine to a generic teenage girl. A canopy bed with a purple bedspread. A desk with a fake iMac G3. A poster of a boy band she’d never liked. A bookshelf filled with empty binders designed to look like yearbooks and copies of The Baby-Sitters Club. It was a careful collage of market research, completely devoid of her. Her room had been a chaos of books, fossils she’d collected, maps tacked to the wall, and a bulletin board thick with tickets and photos. This was a showroom.

Exhaustion, a heavy, granular thing, settled into her bones. She couldn’t confront this tonight. She used the pristine, vintage-style bathroom (the towels were thick, monogrammed with a ‘C’ for Chronos), changed into her own clothes, and crawled into the canopy bed. The sheets were high-thread-count, smelling of Clean Linen. She lay in the dark, in this replica of a childhood she didn’t recognize, staring at the ceiling where she’d once glued glow-in-the-dark stars. The ceiling was smooth, blank.

Sleep was a distant country. Every time she drifted, a sound would jerk her awake—the faint hum of the fridge cycling on, the creak of a floorboard (was it Harrow's Creek settling, or was it programmed?), her own heart thudding dully against her ribs. The silence was a presence, a listening thing.

Sometime after midnight, she gave up. She slipped out of bed and padded downstairs, drawn by a need for water, for something real. The moon cast long, pale rectangles of light through the blinds, striping the Pac-Man rug. In the kitchen, she filled a glass from the tap. The water was very cold, very real.

As she stood there drinking, her eyes fell again on the Memory Lane Guidebook, a pale rectangle on the dark table. The moon illuminated it. She walked over, not turning on the light, and opened it to a random page. The text was a blur in the low light.

But as she went to close it, a leaf of paper, different from the rest—thinner, less creamy—fluttered out from the back and spiraled to the floor.

Frowning, she picked it up. It wasn’t printed with the cheerful Chronos font. It was a photocopy, slightly faded, of a typescript document. A memo. The header read: Chronos Stays Internal: Property Development & Curation. Subject: 214 Maple – “The Lawson Residence.”

Her pulse quickened. She moved closer to the window, angling the page to catch the moonlight.

…primary challenge remains the daughter, Maya Lawson (b. 1986). While the parents’ narrative is easily framed (stable, middle-class, “traditional”), her presence in the property’s history is more… dissonant. School records indicate a rebellious streak, later artistic pursuits. Neighbor testimonials reference loud arguments, “unusual” friends. To ensure a cohesive, marketable nostalgia (core demographic seeks comfort, not complexity), we have minimized her imprint. The bedroom is a generic template. References in the guidebook are to a faceless “you.”

However, the site manager’s report from final staging notes a persistent anomaly. In the master bedroom closet, behind the paneling installed over the original plaster, workers heard what they described as “a faint, rhythmic scratching, like writing.” No source was found. It was deemed settling pipes. Recommend monitoring. Some stains, too, on the subflooring in that closet proved impossible to fully remove or explain (see addendum photo). We have sealed the area. The “family dinner” activity is designed to anchor the emotional focus in the kitchen/dining area, away from the master suite. The goal is to direct the guest’s emotional journey, not follow Harrow's Creek’s own.

Maya stopped breathing. The cold glass in her hand dripped condensation onto the floor. The quiet rage inside her didn’t flare; it turned to ice, to a focused, crystalline point.

They had not only erased her; they had sealed away a part of Harrow's Creek that even they couldn’t explain. A scratching. Stains.

She looked up from the damning page, her eyes traveling through the dark hallway, up the stairs she could just see the bottom of, towards the room that had been her parents’. The master bedroom.

The guidebook’s final, chirpy recommendation echoed in the new, charged silence: Stage a family dinner. Props in cupboard.*

But Harrow's Creek, the real, stubborn, haunted bones of it, had just offered a different suggestion. One not found in the app. One they had tried to panel over.

She placed the glass quietly in the sink. The internal memo she folded carefully and tucked into the pocket of her sweatpants. She walked to the utility closet under the stairs, the one that used to hold brooms and her father’s fishing rods. Inside, next to the wifi router and the HVAC system, she found what she was looking for: a basic toolbox, provided for minor guest emergencies.

She selected a flat-head screwdriver. Its weight in her hand was solid, real, an anchor in the curated sea of fake fruit and plastic chicken.

The moonlit stairs didn’t creak as she ascended, a silent accomplice. The door to the master bedroom was ajar. She pushed it open.
