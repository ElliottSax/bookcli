Chapter 7: Curated Conflict

Chapter 7: Curated Conflict

The second night began with a different kind of silence. It wasn’t the dense, woolen quiet of abandonment, but a held breath. Maya lay in the curated bed, the linen sheets cool and impersonal, and stared at the ceiling where the streetlamp painted a familiar, skeletal pattern of the maple branch. The house had stopped whispering. It was waiting. She felt it in the floorboards, in the dust motes suspended in the stale air. Her confrontation with the past had been private, a duel fought with ghosts. The house, it seemed, was now preparing to offer a spectacle.

It started at 8:03 PM. A low, resonant thrum vibrated through the west wall, the shared wall with the Carson house. Then came the voices—not the raised, chaotic voices of real argument, but projected, deliberate tones. A man’s voice, dripping with performative indignation: “I’m sorry, but the survey from 1912 clearly shows the property line runs along the lilac hedge!” A woman’s voice, reply sharp with rehearsed frustration: “Your lilacs are encroaching, Harold. They’re stealing my sunlight!”

Maya went to the window. The Carson house, a twin to her own but painted a cheerful, anachronistic butter-yellow, was lit up like a stage. Its porch held a dozen people in the soft, expensive casual wear of tech money: stone-washed jeans, branded fleeces, sleek sneakers that glowed in the dark. They held wine glasses. They formed a loose semicircle around two individuals in the center: a man in a ridiculous period-appropriate waistcoat and a woman in a prim, vintage dress. The hired actors.

Her phone chimed. Chronos App. A notification: Neighborhood Drama (1923) in progress at 47 Maple. For an enhanced ambient experience, observe from your front porch. Authentic conflict textures available.

A cold, sharp laugh escaped her. They were selling her own neighborhood’s bones back to her as background music. She pulled on a sweater over her sleep clothes and went downstairs, not to the porch, but out the front door, across the brittle grass of her own lawn, and onto the sidewalk.

The night air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and, faintly, catered canapés. From this vantage point, the scene was even more grotesquely clear. The corporate group watched, some with mildly interested smiles, others checking their watches. A facilitator, a woman in a black turtleneck and wide-legged trousers, stood slightly apart, a tablet in her hand.

“Now, group,” the facilitator said in a calm, instructive voice. “Observe Janet’s body language. The crossed arms, the slight forward lean. This is historical defensiveness. The post-war scarcity mindset manifesting in territoriality. Think about a current project resource allocation. Where do you see these patterns?”

A man in the group nodded sagely. “She’s gatekeeping the sunlight.”

“Excellent, Ben. Gatekeeping.”

The actor playing Harold spluttered, “This is about principle, Janet! Not sunlight!”

Maya felt a heat rising in her chest, a quiet rage that was the opposite of the performative anger on the porch. It was a solid, cold stone. She walked forward, her bare feet in their sneakers silent on the pavement, until she stood at the foot of the Carson steps.

“What is this?” Her voice cut through the scene, sharper than she intended.

The actors paused, glancing at the facilitator. The corporate group turned as one, their faces a blend of curiosity and annoyance at the interruption of their curated experience. The facilitator, unruffled, offered a professional smile.

“Good evening. Are you with the McKinley group? You’re a little late.”

“I live there,” Maya said, jerking her thumb behind her. “What are you doing?”

“Ah!” The facilitator’s smile widened, becoming pedagogical. “You must be a Chronos guest. Wonderful. We’re running a ‘Neighborhood Drama’ experience. This is a team-building module. We’ve recreated a historical boundary dispute based on archived letters from this street. The participants are exercising their empathy muscles within a low-stakes historical context. It’s about understanding conflict roots.”

Maya stared at her. The words were so clean, so surgically removed from meaning. “Empathy muscles,” she repeated flatly.

“Yes. By role-playing past tensions, we build skills to de-escalate present ones. It’s conflict-as-service.”

On the porch, ‘Harold’ adjusted his waistcoat, looking bored.

“This isn’t a past tension,” Maya said, her voice low. “The Carsons and my grandparents did argue about that lilac hedge. For twenty years. Mrs. Carson once threw a rotten tomato at my grandfather. He built a fence out of old pallets just to spite her. It’s not a module. It was their lives.”

The facilitator’s expression didn’t change, but her eyes cooled a degree. “That’s precisely the rich texture we aim to channel. We honor that history by giving it a new, purposeful life. It’s a form of preservation.”

“You’re making a cartoon of it. A party game.”

Before the facilitator could respond, a new voice erupted from the darkness down the street. A raw, real voice, cracked with age and fury.

“Turn that goddamned noise off! Have you lost your minds? It’s a Tuesday night!”

Old Mr. Henderson emerged from the shadows of his own unrenovated bungalow, a stooped figure in a moth-eaten cardigan. He wielded a plastic watering can like a scepter. “I’ve called the police! I’m calling them again! This is a neighborhood, not a goddamned television studio!”

This was real. The rage was hot, spittle-flecked, born of a thousand small indignities—the constant rotation of strangers, the garbage bins left out for days, the loss of the dog who used to bark at noon, the cat who vanished, the silence where there used to be the sound of a neighbor’s piano. This was the true conflict, the current one, and it was erupting like a septic wound.

The corporate group shifted uncomfortably. This wasn’t in the itinerary. This wasn’t historical defensiveness; this was present-tense, undignified fury.

The facilitator’s calm finally fissured. She touched her earpiece and spoke quietly, urgently. “We have an ambient integrity breach. Phase three, please.”

Within sixty seconds, a silent black golf cart with discreet Chronos insignia glided up the street. Two men in dark polos and khakis—private security with the benign look of campus police—emerged. They moved with efficient, practiced grace.

“Mr. Henderson,” the taller one said, his voice a soothing baritone. “You’re disturbing a licensed experiential event. Let’s get you back inside.”

“This is my street!” Henderson yelled, but his voice was already losing its power, smothered by their institutional calm. “You can’t! I’ve lived here for forty-seven—”

“We understand,” the other security officer said, taking gentle but firm hold of his elbow. “It’s late. You’ll feel better in the morning. We’ve spoken to your daughter in Portland. She’s concerned about your blood pressure.”

The mention of his daughter was a masterstroke. The fight drained from Mr. Henderson’s posture. His shoulders slumped. He allowed himself to be turned, led back toward his dark house, a ghost being ushered back into his tomb. The watering can hung limp at his side.

The facilitator clapped her hands softly, addressing her group. “A valuable, unscripted moment, team. Observing how raw emotion can disrupt constructive dialogue. Note the escalation, and the effective de-escalation strategies. Let’s return to our scenario.”

The actors snapped back into position. “My lilacs are a legacy, Janet!” Harold proclaimed, but the magic was broken. The group’s attention was scattered. They’d seen the man behind the curtain, and it was just a tired old man being led away.

Maya stood frozen on the sidewalk. The quiet rage inside her had crystallized into something clear and lethal. She looked at the facilitator. “Effective de-escalation strategies,” she echoed.

The woman met her gaze, her professionalism a polished shield. “We have a responsibility to the community experience as a whole. Chronos holds the permits for ambient sound. His outburst was a violation.”

“He is the community,” Maya whispered, but the facilitator had already turned back to her paying guests.

Maya walked back to her house. She didn’t go inside. She sat on the top step of her own porch, in the dark, watching the curated conflict wind down next door. The wine flowed again. Laughter erupted—nervous, relieved. The actors took a bow. The group broke into polite applause. By 9:30 PM, they were piling into luxury vans, their empathy muscles presumably fatigued. The lights in the Carson house went out, leaving it a vacant, butter-yellow shell.

The real street was silent once more. But the silence was different now. It was complicit. It had been purchased.

Maya sat there for a long time, the cold of the concrete seeping through her clothes. She thought of Leo, the authenticity sourcer, harvesting the painful, beautiful weeds of people’s lives so they could be packaged as a seasonal bouquet. She thought of Mr. Henderson’s defeated slump. She thought of her grandfather, building that ugly fence, a real act of real spite that grew real honeysuckle over it years later, which Mrs. Carson would sometimes cut and bring into her own house.

Her phone chimed again in her pocket. She didn’t want to look. She finally did.

It was a message from the Chronos App, but not a notification. It was a direct, automated communication.

Dear Guest,
We hope you enjoyed last night's authentic street theater. Your proximity to the event provided a unique, immersive layer to your stay. Your feedback is valuable to us. Please rate your emotional resonance on a scale of 1-10.

Below the message were ten empty circles, like little barren moons.

Maya’s thumb hovered over the screen. The quiet rage hummed. She didn’t tap a rating. Instead, she opened a new text window to Leo, the only other person she knew who might see the rot behind the fresh paint.

She typed: Saw the ‘Neighborhood Drama’ next door. They led old Mr. Henderson away like a stray dog. You were right. It’s a museum of stolen things.

She almost deleted it. It was too raw, too revealing. But the hook was set—not just in her, but in the silent, watching street. She hit send.

Three dots appeared almost immediately. Then they vanished. No reply came. The screen went dark, reflecting her own pale, haunted face back at her in the moonless night. The house behind her waited, an unclaimed room in a curated world, and she was now, irrevocably, a part of its conflict.
