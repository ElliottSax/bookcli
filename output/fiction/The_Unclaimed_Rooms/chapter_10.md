Chapter 10: The Attic

The house did not settle after Anya left. It held its breath. The polished silence accusing, the curated warmth now a clinical glow. Maya moved through the rooms like a ghost haunting a museum of herself. Every object—the vase, the rug, the falsely angled photograph—appeared to whisper Anya’s gentle, logical poison: *It’s better this way. It has meaning this way. Let us have the pain, we’ll give it back as story.*

The floorboards creaked under her feet, the sound echoing through the stillness like a sleepy cat’s mew. The faint scent of vanilla and fake wood chips hung in the air, a sharp smell of artificial nostalgia that turned her stomach. Maya like a pawn on a game board, waiting for her cue. But something had shifted. A tiny tremor in the air, a pulse in the quiet. She didn’t know what it was, but it was enough to keep her moving.
Leo’s clue was a cold spot. A patch of wrongness in the perfectly controlled climate. He’d brushed past her after breakfast, eyes on the floor. “The northeast corner of the hallway upstairs,” he’d muttered, the words barely audible. “The floorboard under the runner. It sings a different note.” Then he was gone, a shadow absorbed by the wall.
At first, it seemed like nothing. Just another of Leo’s cryptic remarks. But now, as night drew its cold fingers around Harrow’s Creek, she couldn’t shake the feeling he’d left her a gift, or a map. The words *it sings a different note* played in her mind, a steady rhythm pulling her forward.
Now, in the deep night, she knelt. The Persian runner was a company prop, all bright dye and no wear. She rolled it back, revealing honey-oak floorboards so uniform they looked cut from one perfect beam. She pressed her palms flat, then her cheek, against the cool, unforgiving wood. She crawled, knocking gently with her knuckles. *Knock-knock. Knock-knock.* Solid, solid, solid. Then, a hollow *thock*—a sound less like wood and more like a chest cavity.
The board looked no different, but its edges were slightly worn, like a scraped knee. She dug her fingernails in, to no effect. She went to her father’s old study—now ‘The Gentleman’s Retreat’—and took the brass letter opener from the desk. Returning, she worked it into the seam. With a soft, reluctant sigh, the board lifted.
Inside was not a compartment, but a key. A single, old-fashioned skeleton key lay in the dust and insulation like a fallen bone. Beside it was a folded, grease-stained square of paper. She opened it. A pencil drawing in her father’s precise, architectural hand. A cross-section of the house, with a tiny, almost hidden staircase drawn inside the wall of the linen closet, leading up to a space labeled simply, in his writing: *The Keep.*

The linen closet smelled of lavender sachets from Chronos. She emptied it, stacking the stiff new towels in the hall. The back wall was beadboard. She ran her hands over it, pressing, searching. Near the top, her fingers found a slight depression. She pushed. A click, and the whole panel swung inward on silent, well-oiled hinges—her father’s work. Beyond was darkness, and a smell that was not lavender.
It was the smell of time left alone. Dry rot and forgotten paper, the ghost of cedar, the faint sweet-sour tang of apples long turned to vinegar. Under it all was the cold, mineral scent of decades of dust, not the kind sprinkled on Chronos shelves. She got a flashlight from the kitchen drawer (a ‘period-appropriate’ torch, battery-powered). Its beam cut the blackness, showing narrow, steep stairs of raw, unfinished wood, splinters catching the light.
She climbed. The air grew colder, thicker. The flashlight beam shook over spiderwebs like torn lace, over the dead husks of flies caught in their final dance. At the top, the light could not find a wall. It ate the darkness, piece by piece.
The attic was not a room. It was a landscape.
It was the opposite of the Harrow’s Creek below. Here was chaos where downstairs was order; truth where downstairs was fiction. It was a wave of memory frozen mid-crash. Furniture was stacked like layers of rock: her grandmother’s horsehair sofa on the broken ping-pong table, on a crate of mildewed *National Geographics*. Boxes spilled open: Christmas ornaments tangled with extension cords, a bag of her mother’s knitting wool, moth-eaten and bleeding color. A dressmaker’s dummy, its torso pocked with rust, stood guard beside a stack of her father’s engineering journals, their pages swollen with damp.
And everywhere, the relics of the real. Not the staged, symbolic relics, but the blunt, unsentimental ones. Her father's actual toolbox, the green metal scarred with drops of paint and grease, the sockets inside rusting in their trays. Her mother's gardening clogs, caked with ancient, petrified mud, not the pristine pair by the back door. A cracked aquarium, a single, tiny plastic diver forever searching its empty gravel.
Maya moved through the canyon of her past, the beam of her light trembling with each step. She opened a cardboard box labeled "Ella's School." Inside were report cards, finger paintings a sun had faded to ghosts, a dried-out glue pot. And her diaries. A stack of them, with cheap locks that yielded to a twist. The earliest one was pink, with a unicorn. She opened it, the paper brittle. The writing was large, looping. Today I saw a dead bird. It was soft. I put it in a shoebox. Mom said it was sleeping.
She put it down, a stone in her throat. Memories scraped against the wall of her mind, the edges raw and bleeding. She had forgotten how small she used to be, how fragile. Forgotten the taste of tears and crushed dreams.
Then her light caught something that did not belong. Neat, modern archival boxes, gray and sturdy, stacked with corporate precision against the far eaves. They were labeled with QR codes and plain text. "Staging – 1980s Kitchen." "Backup Audio – Father Figure 3 (Anglo-Indian)." "Ambient Odor Canisters – 'Sunday Roast,' 'Fresh Linens,' 'Pet Dog.'"

She tore one open. It contained dozens of identical, brand-new 'vintage' tea towels. Another held replacement bulbs for the specific, curated lamps downstairs. Another held a dozen copies of the same prop book, The History of Navigation.
The collision was vertiginous. Here, her actual childhood snow globe, the water cloudy, the Eiffel Tower detached and floating. And here, next to it, a box of fifty identical, brand-new 'nostalgic' snow globes (Generic Winter Scene).
But it was the box marked "Experience Development – Phase 2 & Add-Ons" that stopped her breath. She lifted the lid. Inside were blueprints, not of Harrow's Creek, but of narratives.
