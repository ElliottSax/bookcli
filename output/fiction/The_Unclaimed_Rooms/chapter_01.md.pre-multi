Chapter 1: The Ghost in the Listing

A long metallic exhalation bled into the grey afternoon as the train sighed to a halt. Pressing her forehead to the cool glass, Maya watched the town emerge through the fog of her breath—not as a memory, but as a poorly rendered imitation. The old grain silo, once a rusted monolith, now served as a muraled canvas for a frothing craft beer logo. Where her father had bought nails by the pound, a boutique sold artisanal candles in jars that looked like they should hold nails. Everything stood sandblasted and repurposed, set dressing for a play she hadn’t auditioned for.

On the platform, the air was different. Not just the smell—less river mud, more roasted coffee and something sweetly chemical, like new laminate flooring—but the weight of it. That damp, familiar pressure, like the hand of a relative, was gone. Now it felt light, indifferent, scented for someone else’s pleasure.

She had returned for the funeral of a barely-remembered great-aunt, a convenient excuse for this private, masochistic pilgrimage. Her suitcase wheels clattered over cobblestones, uneven since the 1920s but now polished to a treacherous sheen. “The Gristle” occupied the old butcher’s shop. A laugh, sharp and sour, rose in her throat. They probably served charcuterie boards on miniature chopping blocks.

Her hotel was another new entity, all reclaimed wood and industrial lighting. The receptionist, a young man with a severe beard, carried an air of profound cultural curation. “Welcome to The Cooper’s Nook,” he said, as if bestowing a sacrament. Her room was beige and efficient, a capsule designed for transit. It held no echoes. Perfect, and it made her skin itch.

Restless, she dumped her bag and walked. Muscle memory guided her feet away from the revitalized riverfront, up the gradual hill where the streets grew quieter and the updates less complete. Here, the houses still wore their original vinyl siding, their chain-link fences sagging with a familiar fatigue. Her heart began a dull, thickening beat. She turned onto Sycamore Street.

And stopped.

The house—the butter-yellow colonial with the stubborn drippy faucet that had sounded like a metronome in summer, the front porch where the swing used to groan—was gone. No, not gone. Transfigured.

A tasteful slate grey now covered the clapboard. The overgrown lilac bush her mother had loved had been replaced by symmetrical boxwoods in stark granite planters. Black, assertive shutters framed the windows. A discreet, polished plaque by the front door stood blank, a void demanding to be looked at without offering anything to see.

A cold knot tightened in Maya’s stomach. Fumbling for her phone with numb fingers, she opened a browser, thumbs clumsy against the screen. She typed her old address, 1721 Sycamore Street, expecting nothing but a map pin.

The first result was not a map. It was a listing.

*Chronos Stays: Authentic 90s Nostalgia Experience.*

Her vision tunneled. Leaning against the rough bark of the oak tree on the opposite curb—the one she’d climbed as a child, its lower branch now amputated for aesthetic clearance—she clicked.

Lush, professional photography filled the screen. A slideshow began to auto-play.

There was the living room, but the once-comforting beige walls were now a stark white. Her father’s battered corduroy recliner was gone. In its place, a vibrant, turquoise-blue sofa, artfully dented with cushions, sat beneath a framed *Pulp Fiction* poster. A translucent landline phone, the kind everyone wanted and nobody had, coiled on a side table next to a stack of *Nickelodeon Magazine*.

She swiped. The kitchen. Her mother’s collection of mismatched mugs from teacher conferences was absent. Instead, a single row of identical, pastel-colored Melamine cups hung from hooks. A box of Dunkaroos sat next to a clearly unused Game Boy on the counter. The linoleum floor, which had borne the scuffs of twenty years, was now a pristine checkerboard of black and white vinyl, a cartoon version of itself.

Her breath hitched. She swiped again.

Her bedroom.

They had painted over the faint galaxy of glow-in-the-dark stars stuck to the ceiling. The walls were a generic lavender. But on the bed—her bed, the same oak frame with the chip on the headboard from a thrown dictionary—lay a pink-and-purple tie-dye comforter she’d never owned. A Tamagotchi on a neon lanyard draped over the bedpost. On the desk, a bulky, beige CRT monitor sat beside a trapper keeper adorned with abstract geometric shapes. A copy of *The Baby-Sitters Club* lay splayed, face-down.

It was a museum diorama. An autopsy.

Scrolling to the description, she read:

*Step into a genuine past. Unplug from the relentless now and rewind to a simpler time. This meticulously curated Chronos Stay offers more than a rental; it offers a memory lane. Experience the authentic texture of the 1990s: spend an evening browsing ‘blockbuster’ VHS tapes, craft a friendship bracelet at the original Formica kitchen table, or simply bask in the analog glow of a tube television. Every detail, from the collectible cereal boxes to the dial-up modem sound effect (optional), is designed for immersive temporal travel. Perfect for generationally nostalgic getaways or unique thematic photo shoots. Please note: to preserve period integrity, Wi-Fi is intentionally unavailable. Connectivity pack can be rented for an additional fee.*

The words swam. “Authentic texture.” “Meticulously curated.” “Temporal travel.” A quiet, seismic rage began to build in her chest, so profound it felt like silence. They had scraped the life out of it—the arguments, the burnt casseroles, the quiet despair of Tuesday nights, the specific smell of her father’s pipe tobacco lingering in the curtains for years after he quit—and replaced it with a consensuals of memorabilia. They had turned her father’s lost job, her mother’s stifled sighs, her own lonely adolescence into a themed playground. A “simpler time.” It had been complex, messy, and achingly real. And they had sanitized it into a product.

A couple in their twenties, dressed in expensive athleisure wear, approached the slate-grey door. The man held his phone up, scanning a code. A sleek keypad by the door flashed green. They laughed, stepping inside. The door closed, swallowing them into her past.

Maya stood there until the streetlights flickered on, casting the house in a new, theatrical glow. The rage cooled into something harder, more crystalline: a purpose.

Back in the beige hotel room, she sat on the edge of the bed, the blue light of her laptop washing over her face. She navigated back to the Chronos Stays site. The listing for 1721 Sycamore was available next week. A two-night minimum.

Her hands were steady now, cold. She created a new email address: jane.doe.1972@gmail.com. For the guest name, she typed: M. Ellis. Her mother’s maiden name.

The booking process was frictionless, a smooth slide into the absurd. Credit card details. A waiver about “managing expectations regarding historical appliance operation.” An offer for a “Welcome Basket” of Gushers, Surge soda, and Pop Rocks for $29.99. She declined.

The final screen appeared. Confirm Your Journey to the Past?

Her finger hovered over the trackpad. She saw the staged turquoise sofa where her father had once wept, silently, after the phone call from the factory. She saw the decorative Dunkaroos on the counter where her mother had left the note, written on the back of a grocery list, the one that said “Gone for a drive. Back soon.” She’d been gone for three days that time. She saw the lavender bedroom where she, at fourteen, had decided that the only way out was to become a ghost in her own life, to float through the halls unnoticed.

She clicked ‘confirm.’

The confirmation email arrived with a soft, digital chime. Your Temporal Getaway Awaits! Access instructions will be sent 24 hours prior to check-in. We recommend packing period-appropriate attire to enhance immersion.

Maya closed the laptop. The room was dark, silent, and utterly hollow. She had just paid $475, plus cleaning fee and platform charge, to sleep in her own childhood bedroom. To be a tourist in the museum of her own pain.

She lay back on the hotel bed, staring at the featureless ceiling. The hook was not in the booking. The hook was in what came after. What did you do when you found your life had been turned into a rental property? You didn’t just visit. You haunted it.

And a haunting, she thought, as a thin, wintry smile touched her lips, required a ghost who knew where all the bodies were buried. Who knew that the real memory wasn’t in the trapper keeper or the dial-up tone, but in the hairline crack in the basement foundation where she’d hidden her diary, in the particular floorboard that groaned outside her parents’ room, in the back of the hallway closet where the wallpaper, if you peeled it back just an inch, still bore the pencil marks of her childhood height.

She would check in. She would occupy their curated nostalgia. And then, methodically, precisely, she would begin to dismantle it, room by unclaimed room.
