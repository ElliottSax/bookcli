Chapter 2: Check-In

Chapter 2: Check-In

The taxi, a silent electric pod, glided away from the curb, leaving Maya standing on the cracked sidewalk under the bruised plum sky of early evening. 214 Maple Street. The address was a fossil, a piece of her own bone structure. But the house that wore it was a stranger.

It was her house, and it wasn’t. The skeleton was the same: the broad, welcoming porch, the gabled window of the attic where she’d hidden her diaries, the sugar maple in the front yard, now strung with delicate, solar-powered fairy lights. But the skin was all wrong. The peeling white paint she remembered, the color of old teeth, was now a flawless coat of “Heritage Grey.” The screen door that used to slam with a sound like a firecracker had been replaced by a solid, dark-stained thing with a discreet keypad that glowed a soft, menacing blue. The hydrangea bush her mother had nursed for a decade was gone, replaced by symmetrical boxwoods in sleek steel planters. The house had been digitally remastered.

Maya’s suitcase, a small, hard-shelled beetle, sat beside her. She felt like she was made of static. The flight, the ride from the airport through a town where every third building was either a sleek glass cube or a hollowed-out shell, had left her numb. Now, standing here, the numbness began to crackle at the edges, letting in a cold, sharp air.

She fumbled with her phone, opening the Chronos Stays app. Her booking was there: The Lawson Residence – Authentic 90s Nostalgia Experience. 3 Nights. Guest: Maya P. The ‘P’ was a lie, a last-minute adoption of her mother’s maiden name. She couldn’t bear to give them her real one. A notification blinked: Your keycode is ready. Welcome home. The phrase was a small, precise violence.

She climbed the porch steps, which no longer creaked in their familiar, musical sequence. They were silent, solid. The keypad awaited. She typed the six-digit code: 1-9-9-6. The year she’d turned ten. The year, she supposed, the “experience” was pinned to. A soft beep, a green light, and a heavy thunk as the lock disengaged. No key, no turning, no weight of metal in her hand. Just permission granted by an algorithm.

The door swung inward onto a wall of scent. Not the smell of home—that had been a complex symphony of Murphy’s Oil Soap, simmering garlic, her father’s pipe tobacco (clove, a secret indulgence), and the damp-dog smell of old books. This was a single, dominant note: “Clean Linen.” It was aggressive in its sterility, a scent manufactured to evoke a memory of a memory. It smelled of nothing.

She stepped inside, and the door hissed shut behind her.

The foyer was a museum diorama. The parquet floor her parents had painstakingly refinished was now covered by a large, garishly bright rug depicting Pac-Man and ghosts. The wallpaper, a faded floral, had been stripped and replaced with a feature wall of faux-wood paneling. A landline phone with a coiled cord sat on a small table, a prop. She picked up the receiver. Dead air, not even a dial tone.

“Hello?” she said to the emptiness, her voice swallowed by the thick, sound-absorbing atmosphere. It was too quiet. Their house had been a cacophony: the perpetual hum of the ancient fridge, the rumble of the furnace, the tinny radio from her father’s study, her mother’s voice calling up the stairs.

To her left, the living room. The sagging, forgiving floral sofa was gone. In its place was a sleek, low-slung modular thing in beige, angled precisely toward a wall-mounted flat screen. On the coffee table, a stack of magazines: Nickelodeon Magazine, Sassy, Nintendo Power. They looked untouched, their spines unbroken. She opened one. The pages were crisp, replicas. The crossword was blank.

A wave of dizziness passed over her. She needed to sit, but not on that alien sofa. She wheeled her suitcase further in, her heels clicking on the hardwood now exposed in the hallway. The kitchen lay ahead, a yellow glow emanating from it.

And there, on the kitchen table, centered with absurd precision, was the bowl.

Her breath hitched. It was her mother’s fruit bowl. The heavy, cut-glass one that had always sat on the sideboard, filled with real, slowly-rotting oranges, bananas, whatever was on sale. The light would catch its facets and throw rainbows on the wall on summer afternoons. This bowl held fruit too, but it was wax: apples, grapes, a banana, all gleaming with a perpetual, fake dew. She reached out, her fingers hovering over a perfect, ruby-red apple. They were cold, hard. Taped discreetly to the underside of the bowl’s base was a small, printed tag: Vintage Replica. Please admire, do not remove.

She snatched her hand back as if burned. A replica. Of course. The real bowl was likely in a landfill, or shattered in some long-ago move. This was a stand-in, a actor playing the part of her past. The quiet rage, which had been a simmering undercurrent since she saw the listing, began to boil.

Next to the bowl lay a slim, leather-bound booklet. The Lawson Residence: Memory Lane Guidebook. She opened it with stiff fingers.

Welcome, Time Traveler! it began in a cheerful, script-like font. You’ve stepped into a lovingly preserved slice of 1996. To maximize your Authentic Nostalgia Experience, we recommend the following immersion activities:

Morning: Brew a pot of coffee using the retro-style percolator (pods in drawer #2). Enjoy with a bowl of sugary cereal (assorted, cupboard above fridge) while watching Saturday morning cartoon playlists on the curated channel (Channel 1996).
Afternoon: Pretend to do homework at the kitchen table. Pencils and “Trapper Keeper”-style binder provided in desk drawer. For added realism, imagine a parent asking if you’ve finished your chores.
Evening: Unwind with a selection of VHS tapes from our classic collection. Pop some JiffyPop on the stove (fire safety guide on page 23)!

The prose was a sugar-coated razor. Maya flipped the pages, her heart a cold, hard stone in her chest. There were sections on “Period-Appropriate Playlists” (Grunge, Britpop, Bubblegum), a map of “Authentic Local Hangouts” (most of which were now parking lots or condos), and even a “Family Dynamic Role-Play Suggestions” appendix.

Her eyes scanned down to the final entry for the day.

Recommended Evening Activity: Stage a family dinner. Props in cupboard.

The words seemed to pulse on the page. Stage a family dinner. As if it were a community theatre project. She looked up from the booklet, her gaze sweeping the kitchen. It was a perfect replica of a 90s kitchen, all oak cabinets and laminate counters. Too perfect. The stove was a vintage-style range, but its digital display glowed with a soft blue light. The fridge was a sleek Smeg, masquerading in pastel green.

Driven by a morbid, furious curiosity, she walked to the cupboard mentioned. She opened it.

Inside were props. Four identical, bright yellow plastic plates. Four sets of red plastic cutlery. Four plastic cups with cartoon dinosaurs on them. A plastic platter with a fake, glossy roast chicken glued to it, surrounded by immutable plastic peas and carrots. A plastic vase with fabric tulips. It was a dinner set for a dollhouse, a grotesque parody of sustenance and gathering.

She took out the platter. The chicken was a sickly beige, its skin painted a uniform golden brown. It was lighter than it looked, hollow. She held it in her hands, standing in the silent, Clean Linen-scented kitchen, and a sound escaped her—a choked, dry thing that was neither laugh nor sob.

This was what was left. This plastic chicken, this wax fruit, this manual for pretending. Her father’s booming laugh, her mother’s soft singing as she stirred a pot of real stew, the heated debates about politics, the messy, beautiful chaos of a shared life—all of it had been condensed, sanitized, and packaged as an “experience.” A weekend diversion for people who wanted to feel a pang of “simpler times” before returning to their lives of complexity and meaning.

The rage crystallized, cold and sharp. It wasn’t just grief anymore; it was a sense of profound, irredeemable theft. They hadn’t just bought the house; they had exorcised its ghosts and replaced them with puppets.

She dropped the platter back into the cupboard. It landed with a hollow, rattling plastic sound. She needed air that didn’t smell like a corporate laboratory.

Abandoning her suitcase, she walked through the dining room—set with more plastic fare—and into the backyard. The wooden deck was new, composite material that would never splinter. The lawn was an artificial turf, a uniform, springy green. The old oak tree was still there, thank God, but a tasteful, minimalist bench now encircled its base. No swing. The rusted metal swing set that had stood for twenty years was gone.

She sat on the bench, the cold of the metal seeping through her jeans. The sky was fully dark now, a deep indigo. A real moon, at least, hung over the fake grass. From the neighboring houses, she could see the glow of televisions, the silhouettes of people moving in kitchens that were presumably their own. Lives being lived, not staged.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. A notification from the Chronos Stays app. How’s your first hour in the past? Don’t forget to rate your immersion!

She turned the phone off. The silence that descended was absolute, and in it, she could finally hear the echoes. Not the curated ones from the guidebook, but the real ones. The ghost of her own laughter as she chased fireflies right here, where the turf now lay. The murmur of her parents’ voices floating through the screen door on a summer night. The slam of that old screen door as she stormed out at sixteen, vowing never to come back. She’d kept that vow, in a way. She had come back to a simulation.

After a long while, the cold drove her inside. The house felt even more oppressive, a beautiful trap. She dragged her suitcase upstairs, each step on the carpeted stairs too soft, too quiet. The hallway upstairs was lined with framed prints of 90s movie posters: Clueless, Pulp Fiction, Titanic. Her old bedroom door was closed.

She pushed it open.

The room was a shrine to a generic teenage girl. A canopy bed with a purple bedspread. A desk with a fake iMac G3. A poster of a boy band she’d never liked. A bookshelf filled with empty binders designed to look like yearbooks and copies of The Baby-Sitters Club. It was a careful collage of market research, completely devoid of her. Her room had been a chaos of books, fossils she’d collected, maps tacked to the wall, and a bulletin board thick with tickets and photos. This was a showroom.

Exhaustion, a heavy, granular thing, settled into her bones. She couldn’t confront this tonight. She used the pristine, vintage-style bathroom (the towels were thick, monogrammed with a ‘C’ for Chronos), changed into her own clothes, and crawled into the canopy bed. The sheets were high-thread-count, smelling of Clean Linen. She lay in the dark, in this replica of a childhood she didn’t recognize, staring at the ceiling where she’d once glued glow-in-the-dark stars. The ceiling was smooth, blank.

Sleep was a distant country. Every time she drifted, a sound would jerk her awake—the faint hum of the fridge cycling on, the creak of a floorboard (was it the house settling, or was it programmed?), her own heart thudding dully against her ribs. The silence was a presence, a listening thing.

Sometime after midnight, she gave up. She slipped out of bed and padded downstairs, drawn by a need for water, for something real. The moon cast long, pale rectangles of light through the blinds, striping the Pac-Man rug. In the kitchen, she filled a glass from the tap. The water was very cold, very real.

As she stood there drinking, her eyes fell again on the Memory Lane Guidebook, a pale rectangle on the dark table. The moon illuminated it. She walked over, not turning on the light, and opened it to a random page. The text was a blur in the low light.

But as she went to close it, a leaf of paper, different from the rest—thinner, less creamy—fluttered out from the back and spiraled to the floor.

Frowning, she picked it up. It wasn’t printed with the cheerful Chronos font. It was a photocopy, slightly faded, of a typescript document. A memo. The header read: Chronos Stays Internal: Property Development & Curation. Subject: 214 Maple – “The Lawson Residence.”

Her pulse quickened. She moved closer to the window, angling the page to catch the moonlight.

…primary challenge remains the daughter, Maya Lawson (b. 1986). While the parents’ narrative is easily framed (stable, middle-class, “traditional”), her presence in the property’s history is more… dissonant. School records indicate a rebellious streak, later artistic pursuits. Neighbor testimonials reference loud arguments, “unusual” friends. To ensure a cohesive, marketable nostalgia (core demographic seeks comfort, not complexity), we have minimized her imprint. The bedroom is a generic template. References in the guidebook are to a faceless “you.”

However, the site manager’s report from final staging notes a persistent anomaly. In the master bedroom closet, behind the paneling installed over the original plaster, workers heard what they described as “a faint, rhythmic scratching, like writing.” No source was found. It was deemed settling pipes. Recommend monitoring. Some stains, too, on the subflooring in that closet proved impossible to fully remove or explain (see addendum photo). We have sealed the area. The “family dinner” activity is designed to anchor the emotional focus in the kitchen/dining area, away from the master suite. The goal is to direct the guest’s emotional journey, not follow the house’s own.

Maya stopped breathing. The cold glass in her hand dripped condensation onto the floor. The quiet rage inside her didn’t flare; it turned to ice, to a focused, crystalline point.

They had not only erased her; they had sealed away a part of the house that even they couldn’t explain. A scratching. Stains.

She looked up from the damning page, her eyes traveling through the dark hallway, up the stairs she could just see the bottom of, towards the room that had been her parents’. The master bedroom.

The guidebook’s final, chirpy recommendation echoed in the new, charged silence: Stage a family dinner. Props in cupboard.*

But the house, the real, stubborn, haunted bones of it, had just offered a different suggestion. One not found in the app. One they had tried to panel over.

She placed the glass quietly in the sink. The internal memo she folded carefully and tucked into the pocket of her sweatpants. She walked to the utility closet under the stairs, the one that used to hold brooms and her father’s fishing rods. Inside, next to the wifi router and the HVAC system, she found what she was looking for: a basic toolbox, provided for minor guest emergencies.

She selected a flat-head screwdriver. Its weight in her hand was solid, real, an anchor in the curated sea of fake fruit and plastic chicken.

The moonlit stairs didn’t creak as she ascended, a silent accomplice. The door to the master bedroom was ajar. She pushed it open.
