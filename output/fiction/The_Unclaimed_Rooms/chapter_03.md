Maya’s fingers brushed the edge of the desk, tracing the grain of the wood. Solid and real, at least. Unlike the rest of this place.

Turning to the closet, she found the clothes inside all new, but in the right styles—the kind of things she might have worn at twelve. A pink hoodie with a glittery unicorn on the back, jeans with a frayed hem, a stack of T-shirts with cartoon characters she’d long forgotten. Pulling out the hoodie, she ran her fingers over the soft fabric. It smelled like nothing. No lingering scent of fabric softener, no trace of her mother’s detergent. Just sterile, unmarked cotton.

A small, framed photo on the dresser caught her eye. It showed her and Emily at the mall, both grinning, holding ice cream cones, their faces flushed with the excitement of a rare outing. The photo was real. She remembered that day, one of the last good ones before everything changed.

She picked up the frame. Emily’s smile was wide, braces glinting. Maya’s own smile was smaller, more guarded. Her eyes had already started to look away, as if she knew something was coming.

A sharp knock at the front door jolted her. She set the frame down carefully, smoothing the edges of the photo with her fingertips. The knock came again, more insistent. After a moment’s hesitation, she made her way downstairs.

The doorbell chimed, a cheerful tune that clashed with the tension coiling in her stomach. Through the frosted glass, the silhouette of a man stood tall and relaxed, yet something in his posture made her pause. Her hand reached for the doorknob, then stopped. The house manual had mentioned a “concierge” available to assist. This felt different. An interruption.

She opened the door.

On the porch stood a man in his late thirties, with short, dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a black T-shirt and jeans, arms crossed over his chest. His expression remained neutral, but his eyes held a sharp, assessing quality.

“Maya?” His voice was low and even.

She nodded, fingers tightening around the edge of the door.

“I’m Daniel. I work for Chronos. I just wanted to check in, make sure everything’s to your satisfaction.”

His words were polite, but something lurked beneath them, something she couldn’t quite place. Studying him for a moment, she stepped back, gesturing for him to come in.

“Thanks.” He stepped inside. “This is quite a place, isn’t it?”

She didn’t answer, leading him into the living room. His gaze swept over the carefully arranged furniture, the staged artifacts. His expression didn’t change, yet a subtle disapproval radiated from him.

“It’s not exactly what I expected,” she finally said, keeping her voice carefully neutral.

He nodded, as if he understood. “Chronos prides itself on authenticity. But sometimes, the past isn’t as neat as we’d like it to be.”

She looked at him sharply. “What does that mean?”

He met her gaze, his eyes steady. “It means the past is messy. And sometimes, the people who lived it don’t want to remember that.”

Ice crystallized along the base of her neck. “Are you saying they’ve changed things?”

He shrugged. “I’m saying the past is a construct. And constructs can be manipulated.”

She stared at him, her mind racing. “Why are you telling me this?”

He held her gaze for a moment, then looked away. “Because I think you deserve to know the truth.”

Anger surged through her. “The truth? What truth? That this is all a lie? That my childhood was just some kind of theme park for people to gawk at?”

He shook his head. “No. That’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying the past is complicated. And sometimes, the people who lived it don’t want to remember that.”

She took a deep breath, trying to calm the heat in her chest. “So what do I do now?”

He looked at her, his expression serious. “You decide what you want to remember. And what you want to forget.”

Her mind raced. “And if I don’t want to forget anything?”

He met her gaze, his eyes steady. “Then you fight for it. You fight for the truth, no matter what it costs.”

Determination hardened within her. “Then that’s what I’ll do.”

He nodded. “Good. Because the truth is worth fighting for.”

Her expression turned resolute. “Then let’s get started.”

A small, genuine smile touched his lips. “I was hoping you’d say that.”

Purpose settled over her. “Where do we begin?”

His gaze lingered on the carefully arranged artifacts around the room. “We start by tearing it all down.”

A thrill of excitement shot through her. “And then what?”

He met her gaze, his eyes steady. “And then we rebuild it. The way it was meant to be.”

She nodded, her resolve hardening into something solid. “Then let’s get to work.”sense of purpose settle over her. “Where do we begin?”
