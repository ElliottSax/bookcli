Chapter 9: The Concierge of Memory

The morning after her sabotage arrived not with light, but with a sound: the precise, oiled click of a key in the front door lock. Maya, who had been sitting at the kitchen table tracing the ghost of a water ring with her thumb, froze. It was too early for housekeeping. Leo had said they came on Thursdays. This was Wednesday. The click was followed by the sigh of the door opening, and footsteps—not the shuffling, rubber-soled tread of a cleaner, but a firm, unhurried cadence on the parquet.

A woman appeared in the kitchen doorway. She was maybe forty-five, dressed in a cashmere sweater the colour of oatmeal and trousers that fell in a perfect, knife-like line. Her hair was a smooth, dark bob, and her face was pleasantly, unremarkably symmetrical. She carried no toolkit, no clipboard. Just a small, leather folio under one arm. She smelled of lemongrass and clean linen.

“Maya,” she said, and her voice was warm honey, a contralto that promised understanding. “I’m Anya. I’m here to help.”

Maya’s skin prickled. “How do you know my name?”

Anya offered a smile that was both apologetic and conspiratorial. “We like to know our guests. Especially the ones who engage so… creatively with our properties.” Her eyes, a calm grey, swept the room. They didn’t dart; they absorbed. They took in the armchair Maya had pulled to face the blank wall, the vintage National Geographic (her own, found in a box in the trunk) placed deliberately on the coffee table beside the Chronos-approved Life magazines, the absence of the leather-bound guidebook.

“I see you’ve been redecorating,” Anya said, gliding into the room. She ran a finger along the mantelpiece, checking for dust, finding none. “The chair by the wall is an interesting choice. A statement on isolation? Or just a better reading light?”

“It’s where my grandfather used to sit to listen to the ballgame,” Maya said, the lie coming easily, sharpened by a sudden, defensive rage. “The radio reception was better there.”

Anya’s smile deepened, as if Maya had just presented a fascinating, slightly flawed thesis. “Ah. A curated memory of your own. I respect that. But I’m afraid it conflicts with the established narrative of the space. The ‘Harold and Margaret’ narrative, specifically. Harold preferred the chair by the window. For the cross-breeze.”

“Harold and Margaret weren’t real,” Maya spat.

“Weren’t they?” Anya’s tone was gently corrective. She opened her folio, pulling out a single, creamy sheet of paper. “Harold Miller, textile salesman. Margaret, née Greene, part-time librarian. They bought this house in 1962. He died of a coronary occlusion in 1988. She moved to a senior facility in 1995. The details are a matter of public record. We just… amplified their essence. Gave their story a stage.”

“You commodified a couple of strangers’ lives. You turned their grief into a themed hotel.”

“We preserved what time destroys,” Anya said, her voice softening into a
