Chapter 5: The First Night

The silence in 214 Maple Street wasn’t real silence. It was manufactured, a thick, muffled quiet pumped through the vents to encourage “optimal nostalgic reflection,” as the manual called it. This silence had a feel to it, like being wrapped in scented cotton labeled “Essence of Rain-Washed Slate & Childhood Summers.” Maya lay stiff on the bed, the overly soft mattress shaping around her like a trap. The room, her room, was a perfect study in gentle removal. The walls, once a messy collection of concert tickets, postcards from forgotten friends, and a single smear of blue paint from an old art project, were now a smooth, plain grey. The ceiling, where her glow-in-the-dark stars had been carefully removed, was blank. Only faint traces remained—a darker spot where her bookshelf had been, a scuff near the outlet from years of plugging in chargers. The room was a tomb for a ghost that was still alive.
Her phone, Harrow's Creek’s provided device, chimed with a soft, wooden tone.
“Curated Comfort: Phase Three. To help you sleep, we invite you to enjoy a period-appropriate bedtime snack. Your treat is in the kitchen. A moment of sweetness for sweet dreams.”

Maya didn’t move. She watched dust particles, visible in the light of her old-fashioned bedside lamp, float through the air. They were the only thing in the room that seemed unplanned. Another, more urgent chime.
She sighed, a sound absorbed by the soundproofing, and got out of bed. The floorboards, once so loud, gave only a polite, standard creak. She walked downstairs, the cool of the polished wood rising into her feet. The kitchen, lit softly by lights under the cabinets, was a stage set waiting for its one actor. On the wide, empty counter sat a single item: a plastic cup of chocolate pudding with a foil lid. The brand was unmistakable. Snack-Pak. A relic.
Her mother had bought them in bulk, a cheap, easy dessert for two always-hungry, always-busy kids. They were eaten after scraped knees, after bad report cards, during tense, quiet dinners where the only sound was a spoon scraping plastic. They weren’t a treat; they were a ceasefire, a sugary white flag.
Maya picked it up. The plastic was cold. The foil lid shone under the lights. The app prompted her: “Peel back the lid. Remember the sound? The promise of simple sweetness.”

“Go to hell,” she whispered to the empty room.
But her fingers moved on their own. The foil came off with a *thwick-thwuck* that was painfully familiar. The smell came first—not rich chocolate, but that specific, overly sweet, artificial cocoa scent. It smelled of childhood headaches, of harsh kitchen lights, of her mother’s tired eyes.
She found a spoon in a drawer—a strangely heavy, artisanal thing that wrong in her hand—and took a bite. The texture was just as she remembered: slick, perfectly smooth, with a slight, gummy firmness. It coated her tongue and throat. It was the taste of a comfort that didn’t comfort, of a sweetness that left a metallic hint behind.
Another bite. The past didn’t rush back; it seeped in, slow and thick. She was standing in this hyper-real, fake kitchen, eating this hyper-real, real pudding, and the contradictions tore her open. This was her mother’s gesture, but her mother was gone. This was her kitchen, but it belonged to a company called Nostalgia™. This was a memory, but it was being handed to her on a digital platter with instructions.
Her breath caught. The spoon clattered into the sink, a jarring sound in the muted house. The sickly sweetness turned to glue in her mouth. She gripped the edge of the counter, her knuckles white against the stone. The air, that carefully designed air, heavy, solid. She was breathing “Essence of Rain-Washed Slate” but smelling only decay, only loss. The kitchen walls, with their perfectly arranged canisters and empty fruit bowls, appeared to press slowly inward. This wasn’t her home. It was a display. She was the specimen pinned in the middle, labeled *Grieving Daughter, 34, susceptible to curated prompts*.
A panic attack, clinical and cold, detached from the emotion it was supposedly about. Her heart was a frantic bird in a sensor-filled cage. Her vision tunneled, the perfect kitchen blurring at the edges. She was drowning in a staged sea. She was alien, utterly alien, in the one place that was supposed to be the origin of self. The rage arrived then, not hot, but cold and sharp—a scalpel of fury. They had taken her past, her pain, her private, ugly pudding memories, and they had monetized the aesthetic of them. They had turned her mother’s exhausted love into a phase of a curated comfort package.
She stumbled to the sink, ran the tap cold, and splashed water on her face. It was shockingly real, that water. It dripped from her chin onto the pristine farmhouse apron sink. She stared at her reflection in the black window, a pale, distorted ghost superimposed over the reflection of the perfect kitchen. The panic ebbed, leaving behind a hollowed-out, clean ache. And a relentless, gnawing curiosity. What did other people see here?
Back in the bedroom, shivering under the duvet, she opened Harrow's Creek app. There was a section she’d avoided: “Guest Reflections: A Digital Hearth.”

It was a guestbook. Not paper, but infinite scroll.
“Stayed in the ‘Youthful Dreamer’s Room.’ Felt like I finally had the childhood bedroom I always wanted. So peaceful! Ordered the ‘Saturday Morning Cartoon’ breakfast package. Worth every penny. – Jason, 42.”

“My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here. We pretended we were high school swee the arts, meeting in the hallway between the bedrooms. It was so romantic to imagine a life we never had. The ‘First Kiss’ scent diffusion in the foyer is incredible! – Diane & Mark, 38 & 40.”

“As an only child, staying in the sibling-shared room was a profound experience. I used the app to generate ‘brotherly squabble’ sounds and it made me feel less alone. Thank you for letting me borrow a family. – Lena, 29.”

Maya scrolled, a sick fascination taking hold. Strangers had poured their own longing into this shell. They had used her home, the very architecture of her specific, messy pain, as a blank canvas for their own imagined pasts. They borrowed her ghosts to haunt themselves in more pleasant ways. Jason had wanted her room. Diane and Mark had romanced in her parents’ tense hallway. Lena had borrowed the echo of her and Leo’s fights. It was a cannibalism of memory, a cheerful, consensual vampirism. Her quiet rage found a new edge: satirical, disgusted. Her grief was the foundation, and they were building their fantasy treehouses on it.
She needed a voice that wasn’t an app, a voice that knew the real blue of the living room walls, not the “Historical Accuracy” blue they’d painted over it. She called Leo.
It rang five times before he answered, his voice thick with sleep and the static of a bad connection. “Maya? You okay? It’s… Jesus, it’s 2 AM there.”

“I’m in my room. Our room. It’s grey.”

A pause. She could hear him shifting, a muffled sigh. “Okay. And?”

“And I just ate a Snack-Pak pudding because Harrow's Creek told me to. And I read the guestbook. People are using our house to play pretend family, Leo.”

“So?” The word was blunt, a dull axe. “That’s what it’s for now. We sold it. It’s a product.”

“It’s not a toaster, Leo. It’s where we lived. Where Mom died.”

“And holding onto that is helping you?” His voice was sharp now, awake and irritated. “You paid to sleep in your old bed to prove what? That it still hurts? We know it hurts. The difference is, I’m not paying someone to let me feel it in high definition.”

“They missed things,” she said, her voice small, clinging to the evidence of reality. “There’s a chip in the banister from when you threw my geometry textbook. There’s still a wine stain on the basement floor.”

“Great. Historical artifacts. Look, Maya, you need to let it go. The past is a product now. Everything is. You can either buy it or you can sell it. We sold. You’re choosing to buy it back, but it’s not the same object. It’s simply a… a simulation. Grieve and come home. This isn’t home anymore.”

Grieve and come home. As if grief were a task to be completed, a box to be checked before re-entering the real world. He had metabolized their history into something simple, manageable. She was still choking on it.
“You don’t feel anything being gone?” she asked, the lyrical melancholy a thin veil over the accusation.
“I feel relief,” he said, and the honesty was a slap. “No more property taxes on a memory. No more arguing about what to do with Mom’s ugly china. It’s a clean break. It’s healthy.” He yawned, a loud, dismissive sound. “Go to sleep, Maya. Watch something on your tablet. Don’t read the creepy digital guestbook. It’s just a house.”

The call ended. She held the phone until the screen went black, reflecting her own hollowed-out face. He had let it go. He had turned their shared, messy history into a transaction and walked away, lighter. She was the fool, lying in the wreckage, trying to find a truth in a staged set, angry that the other audience members weren’t respecting the sanctity of the play.
Sleep was impossible. The house’s silence deepened, becoming a physical presence. The scent diffusion system must have cycled to a new phase: “Deep Night: Lavender & Old Paper.” It was a violation, this perfumed oblivion they were trying to force on her. She watched the digital clock on her phone flip from 2:59 to 3:00 AM. The witching hour. The hour of raw thoughts.
She got up, needing water, needing to move in the stillness. She didn’t turn on any lights, moving by the faint, city-glow that leaked around the edges of the blackout blinds. As she strode back from the bathroom, a faint, greenish light caught her eye. A tiny, soft pulse, like the slow blink of a sleeping firefly, coming from under the bed.
Not a nightlight. Something else.
She knelt, the floor cold through her pajamas, and peered into the darkness. There, tucked near the leg of the bedframe, was a small, sleek plastic dome, no larger than a watch face. A sensor. From its center, the gentle pulse glowed: green, then faint yellow, then green again. It was measuring something.
Maya lay flat on her stomach on the floor, her cheek against the wood, and stared at it. The panic attack. The crying. The frantic pacing. The long, still periods of lying awake. Her phone call with Leo, her voice rising in distress. The app knew her location, her engagement with the prompts. But this… this was measuring the quality of her silence. Her restlessness. Her grief.
She crawled back onto the bed, pulling the duvet around her, a shield against the watching air. She opened Harrow's Creek app with trembling fingers, moving past the guestbook, past the manuals, to a tiny, discreet section at the bottom she’d glossed over before: “Your Stay: Data & Enhancement.”

It opened to a dashboard.
Guest: Maya R. Stay Duration: Night 1 of 3.
Emotional Engagement Score: 7.8/10. (High resonance detected.)

Curated Interaction Uptake: 75% (Pudding prompt accepted, guestbook accessed. Bedtime story prompt declined.)

Physiological Response Metrics: Elevated heart rate variability detected between 23:45-00:15. Extended periods of wakefulness noted. Optimal nostalgia threshold maintained.
Recommendation for Day 2: Continue curated comfort prompts. Introduce mild “bittersweet recollection” stimulus (suggested: discovered artifact in living room bookshelf). Consider offering “Connective Call” package to help guest’s processing of familial conflict.
Maya read it once. Then again. The words didn’t blur; they became terrifyingly clear, fixed in the light of the screen. Her pain had been quantified. Her rage, her melancholy, her displacement—all of it was data. The “bittersweet recollection” was being staged for tomorrow. They were going to plant an “artifact” for her to find. They had analyzed her call with Leo and were ready to sell her a solution to the conflict they’d overheard.
The sensor under the bed glowed its steady, pulsing rhythm. Green. Yellow. Green. Measuring her quiet, shuddering breaths. She was not a guest in a museum of her past. She was a performer in a lab, and her grief was the product under observation. The haunting wasn’t from the ghosts of her family, but from the silent, efficient machines documenting her every sigh, ready to refine the haunting for the next paying customer.
Wide awake at 3 AM, Maya stared at the soft, pulsing glow beneath the bed, and understood the true nature of the unclaimed room. It was not a sanctuary for memory. It was a harvesting ground.
