Chapter 3: The Museum of You

Chapter 3: The Museum of You

The silence of the house was not a true silence. It was a held breath, a performance of emptiness. Maya stood in the center of the living room, the keyless entry app still glowing on her phone, and let the curated air settle around her. It smelled of lemongrass and vague, inoffensive cleanliness, a scent that bore no relation to the olfactory memory of this place—the ghost of her father’s pipe tobacco (clove and cherry), the perpetual yeasty warmth of her mother’s bread-making, the damp-dog smell of Buster, the springer spaniel who’d shed his way through her childhood.

The room was a masterclass in selective recall. The shag carpet she’d spilled grape juice on was gone, replaced by wide-plank laminate flooring the color of weathered driftwood. But the brick fireplace, where they’d hung stockings, remained, now housing a perfectly arranged trio of birch logs that would never be burned. Above it, where her parents’ wedding photo had presided, was a large, framed poster of a generic 1990s movie—a film she was sure they’d never owned. The sofa was a convincing replica of the old plaid one, but its fabric was stiff, unyielding, devoid of the permanent impression of her father’s body in the right-hand corner.

Her suitcase, a small, hard-shelled anomaly, stood by the door like an intruder. She ignored it. The house manual, a sleek tablet resting on a mid-century modern side table (an anachronistic touch, she noted with a grimace), had welcomed her with a soft chime. “Welcome to 214 Maple. Your Chronos Stay: ‘Suburban Zenith, 1997.’ We recommend starting your journey in the heart of the home: the kitchen. Select ‘Nostalgia Nourishment’ on your guide for curated snack options.”

Maya powered the tablet off. Its black screen reflected her own face, a woman of thirty-two superimposed on a diorama of her ninth year.

She moved first to the hallway, to the closet under the stairs. It had been Buster’s rainy-day refuge. She opened the door. Inside, instead of a tangle of leashes and old coats, were neatly stacked board games—Mouse Trap, Operation, Dream Phone—all in cellophane-wrapped boxes, their corners sharp. She ran a finger along the seam of Mouse Trap. Never opened. A prop.

But as she turned to leave, her shoulder brushed against the doorframe. She paused. Looked closer. The trim had been painted a fresh, glossy white, but the layers beneath were ghosts haunting the present. And there, almost erased but stubborn as a scar, were the lines.

Five faint pencil marks, a ruler’s width apart, each with a date and a name in her mother’s looping script. Maya – Oct ‘94. Maya – Apr ‘95. The highest one, Maya – Sept ‘97, just before everything began to tilt. They had painted over them, but the graphite, pressed deep into the grain by a mother’s proud hand, had bled through the white. A record of growth, of time measured in inches and hope. She reached out, her fingertip finding the slight ridge of the highest mark. A quiet rage, cold and precise, began to crystallize in her chest. They had staged over her life, but they hadn’t sanded it down to the bone. Not yet.

The kitchen was a symphony of false cheer. A bowl of wax apples glowed on the table. The radio, a retro-style digital unit, was tuned to a station playing a loop of 90s hits, but the ads were for contemporary products, voiced with a vague, ironic inflection. She opened the fridge. It hummed, empty except for six glass bottles of artisanal cream soda and a bowl of green grapes, each identical in size. On the counter, a breadbox held not bread, but a single, shrink-wrapped loaf of “Nostalgia Brand” white bread, soft and impossibly square.

It was in the breakfast nook that she found the first major artifact of the forgery. The wall was designated as a “Child’s Creative Gallery.” It was adorned with three framed posters: a generic dinosaur skeleton, a motivational cat hanging from a branch (“Hang In There!”), and the periodic table. Carefully chosen, inoffensive, mass-produced childhood. The kind of childhood no one actually had.

Maya studied the dinosaur poster. It was tacked up with bright yellow push-pins, another “authentic” touch. On a whim, she lifted the corner. The wall behind was a different color, a pale sunflower yellow her mother had loved. And there, trapped between the new drywall and the staged poster, was a fragment of the past.

A faded drawing, done in marker on curling newsprint. A green brontosaurus with a lopsided smile, floating over a purple triangle that was probably a mountain. In the corner, in her own careful block letters: MAYA’S DINOSAUR. AGE 7.

The air left her lungs. She carefully peeled the poster’s tape away, removed it, and set the cheap frame on the table. The drawing fluttered slightly, a frail, papery moth. They had walled it in. They had literally used her own history as backing for their simulation. She touched the paper. The green marker had bled, and the newsprint had yellowed, but it was here. It was real. She left the poster off, leaving her dinosaur exposed to the sterile, air-conditioned light.

A low, rhythmic thumping began to seep into her awareness. It was the sound of a basketball on driveway concrete. Thump… thump… thump… pause… thump-thump. She went to the window over the sink. The driveway was empty. The sound was perfectly spatialized, coming from the exact spot where the neighbor’s hoop had been. It was ambient audio. “Authentic neighborhood ambiance,” the tablet would probably call it. She listened, and beneath the basketball track, she discerned the distant bark of a dog (not Buster’s), the faint warble of a lawnmower, the occasional whoosh of a car that never arrived. A symphony of absence.

She climbed the stairs, each step letting out a creak. Were they real creaks, or were they engineered? She couldn’t tell anymore. The landing felt smaller. Her parents’ bedroom door was closed, a small plaque reading “Parental Sanctuary” attached to it. She didn’t go in. She couldn’t.

Her own bedroom door was open. It was now the “Young Dreamer’s Retreat.” The walls were a soft lavender. A canopy bed, which she had desperately wanted at ten and never received, dominated the room. A desk held a vintage-looking (but likely brand new) desktop computer, its screen saver a floating logo for Chronos Stays. On the bed sat a single, plush unicorn. It was all so achingly, algorithmically correct.

She opened the closet. Inside hung a small rack of clothing: a Saved by the Bell t-shirt, overalls, a flannel shirt. All in her size from 1997. She checked the tags. They were soft, pre-washed replicas. She let the flannel sleeve slip through her fingers.

This was the moment she broke the rules. She wasn’t here for the simulation. She was here for the substrate. She got down on her knees, ignoring the protest of her joints, and crawled into the closet. It was deeper than she remembered, a dark cavity smelling of new wood and dust. Her hands swept over the smooth, finished floor. Nothing.

Then she reached up, feeling along the underside of the single shelf above the hanging rod. Her father had installed that shelf. He’d let her hold the level. Her fingers, walking blindly through the dark, encountered only smooth particle board. Then, in the far left corner, her index nail caught on a roughness.

She scrambled out, found the tablet, and used its cold light as a flashlight. She crawled back in, the beam illuminating the pale wood. And there it was.

Crudely carved with the point of a compass she’d stolen from her pencil case: M + J.

Maya. And Jake. Jake Ellis, who lived two doors down, who had kissed her right here in this closet during a game of hide-and-seek in the summer of ’96, his mouth tasting of bubble gum and nervousness. A secret pact, a declaration etched into the very architecture of her world. The stagers, with their checklists and their mood boards, had missed it. They’d cleaned, painted, staged, but they hadn’t thought to feel the underside of a shelf.

She stayed there for a long time, kneeling in the closet, her thumb rubbing over the grooves of the plus sign. The rage softened, transmuted into a profound, weary sorrow. This house was no longer a home. It wasn’t even a memorial. It was a museum, and she was a ghost in its most carefully neglected exhibit.

Descending the stairs felt like leaving a church. The artificial dusk was beginning to fall, the smart windows subtly tinting, the house lights warming to a “golden hour” glow. The tablet on the side table lit up unbidden. “Evening Reflection Phase initiated. Would you like to engage with our ‘Memory Lane’ audio narrative?”

“No,” she said aloud, her voice strange in the quiet.

She wandered into the living room. A book lay artfully on the arm of the replica sofa: The Catcher in the Rye. Her father had hated that book. Called Holden Caulfield a “whiny little punk.” Her mother had loved Gone with the Wind. This was someone else’s idea of a 90s teen’s reading list.

Frustration, sharp and sudden, boiled over. She began a methodical, quiet search. Not for memories, but for the machinery. She found the first sensor in the smoke detector in the hallway—a tiny, dark lens winking beside the red power light. The noise machine was hidden behind a vent cover in the living room wall, a small, sleek device with a USB port. The thermostat was a minimalist square, but when she tilted it, a small screen displayed not the temperature, but a feed: Occupant – Living Room. Activity: Stationary. Emotional Cadence: Elevated.

They were watching. Of course they were watching. They were measuring her nostalgia, her therapeutic engagement with their product.

She went to the tablet and powered it on. She bypassed the “Curated Journey” menu and went to the guest portal. There was a reviews section. She clicked on it. Dozens of five-star ratings. She scrolled, her eyes skimming the digital praise.

Then she found it. A review from a user named Seeker47, from two weeks prior.

“Just finished my three-night ‘Suburban Zenith’ stay. Wow. Chronos Stays has perfected the art of emotional time travel. As someone who grew up in a fractured, chaotic environment, the simulation of a stable, simple 90s childhood was profoundly therapeutic. I spent hours just sitting in the ‘Young Dreamer’s Retreat,’ imagining the life I should have had. The attention to detail is breathtaking—even the faint smell of baking that pipes into the kitchen on Sunday morning! It’s a safe, clean container for grief and longing. I left feeling repaired. Like I’d experienced the ghost of a better past. Thank you.”

Maya read it twice. Then a third time. The words “therapeutic,” “fractured,” “repaired,” “ghost” seemed to pulse on the screen. This person had found healing here. In the simulation of her life. They had been repaired by the ghost of her past, a past they had invented for them. The quiet rage returned, not cold now, but hot and humming. This Seeker47 had sat in her bedroom, co-opting her memories, her measured heights on the doorframe, her hidden carving, and used them as a balm for wounds Maya knew nothing about. The violation was absolute, existential.

She put the tablet down, her hands trembling. The house, in its twilight mode, seemed to press in on her, a beautiful, suffocating coffin. She needed air that wasn’t filtered, a sound that wasn’t programmed.

She walked to the front door, but it didn’t open. A soft chime came from the tablet. “For your safety and immersive continuity, exterior access is limited after dusk. You can schedule a ‘Starlight Porch Sit’ via the Outdoor Experiences menu.”

She was locked in. A prisoner in the museum of herself.

Maya turned and leaned against the door, sliding down to sit on the perfect laminate floor, hugging her knees. She looked down the hall, to the kitchen, to the faint, proud ghost of her height marks on the doorframe. The basketball thumped its eternal, lonely rhythm on the invisible driveway. The scent of artificial baking bread began to waft from a hidden diffuser.

And in the deepening, curated dark, her fingers, as if with a will of their own, found a loose thread on the hem of her own, real, present-day jeans. She began to pull, twisting it around her index finger, tighter and tighter, until the tip turned white and numb, a small, present-tense anchor in the vast, staged sea of yesterday.

Hook: As the first fake star appeared on the smart-skylight above her, a notification silently bloomed on the darkened tablet beside her: “Chronos Stays appreciates deep engagement. Our systems indicate you are interacting with core elements. Would you be interested in a follow-up consultation regarding our ‘Foundational Memory’ package? We can discuss permanent archival options for your personal artifacts.”*
