on the patriarch's face, the way his eyes had filled with tears as he'd handed her the keys to the vineyard. She remembered the way his wife had clung to his arm, her fingers trembling as she'd whispered, "We'll be okay, won't we?" She remembered the way the children had looked at her, their eyes wide with confusion and fear. She remembered the way she'd smiled at them, a fake, plastic smile that had made her feel sick to her stomach. She remembered the way she'd walked away, leaving them to their fate, and the way she'd like a monster.
The memory was a physical blow, a punch to the gut that left her gasping for air. She remembered the way she'd that day, the way she'd justified her actions, the way she'd told herself that it was just business. But now, she knew the truth.
