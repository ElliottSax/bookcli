      "description": "Late 20s/early 30s. Brilliant, fiercely disciplined, and emotionally guarded. Once the youngest partner track star at Vance & Locke, she presents a flawless, icy exterior.

      "description": "Early 30s. Charismatic, intuitive, and strategic in a fundamentally human way. A talented but unconventional financial analyst who operates on empathy and pattern recognition as much as spreadsheets. He is grounded, observant, and values people over pure profit.",

      "arc": "Serves as the personification of the cold, punitive corporate world Elara once idolized. His final offer is not a redemption arc for him, but the ultimate crucible for Elara and Leo's new philosophy, forcing them to prove their model can withstand the old guard's greatest pressure."
