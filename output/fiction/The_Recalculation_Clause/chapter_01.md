Inside was a single sheet of paper, a nondisclosure agreement, and a ticket to Reykjavik, departing in three hours. “I want you to go to Sorenson’s headquarters. I want you to find out what they knew, when they knew it, and who knew it. I want you to bring back a way to salvage this, or at least a way to bury it so deep no one will ever find it. You have seventy-two hours. After that, you’re on your own.”

The paper trembled in her hands. Elara looked up at Charles, her mentor, her judge, her last lifeline. His expression was unreadable, a mask of carefully cultivated neutrality. But in his eyes, something else flickered—something raw and human. A doubt, perhaps, or just the ghost of the hope he once had for her.

“Why Iceland?” Her voice barely rose above a whisper.

“Because,” he said, his voice low and measured, “if you’re going to dig up a body, you might as well do it where no one can hear the screams.”

The room seemed to shrink, the walls closing in. The weight of the moment pressed down, the gravity of her situation threatening to pull her under. A deep breath filled her lungs with the scent of leather and old books, grounding her. “I’ll do it,” she said, her voice steady, her resolve hardening. “I’ll find a way.”

Charles nodded, his expression unreadable. “Good. Then you’d better get moving. The clock is ticking, and time is not your friend.”

Elara stood, her movements precise and controlled. She smoothed her skirt, adjusted her blazer, and picked up the folder. Her hand hesitated on the doorknob. She looked back at Charles. “Thank you,” she said, her voice soft but sincere. “For the chance.”

His expression softened slightly. “Don’t thank me yet. You haven’t earned it.”

The door clicked shut, leaving her alone in the 42nd-floor offices of Vance & Locke with the weight of the world on her shoulders. She took a deep breath of city air and stepped forward into the unknown.

The elevator ride down was a blur. Polished steel walls reflected the ghost of her image—a woman on the edge of ruin. Her phone buzzed again, a relentless reminder of the gathering storm. She silenced it, her fingers trembling slightly.

On the main floor, a whirlwind of activity offered a stark contrast to the quiet intensity of the executive suite. The scent of coffee and the hum of conversation, a symphony of normalcy, felt surreal. She navigated the crowd, heels clicking against marble, her mind racing. The doorman hailed a cab; she slipped inside, the leather seat cool against her skin. The driver, a man with a thick accent, glanced at her in the rearview mirror with curious eyes. She gave him the address of the private airstrip, her voice steady despite the inner turmoil.

As the cab pulled away, the city blurred past in a kaleidoscope of lights and movement. She closed her eyes, the scent of the city filling her lungs, the hum of the engine a steady rhythm. Seventy-two hours. That was all she had to save her career, to save herself. The gravity of it threatened to pull her under, but she pushed the thoughts away, focusing on the task at hand.

The airstrip stood in stark contrast to the bustling city. Crisp air carried the scent of jet fuel and a faint tang of the ocean. She boarded the sleek, modern plane, a world away from the chaos.

During the ascent, she watched the city shrink below. The weight pressed down again, but she shoved it aside, locking onto the mission. Seventy-two hours. The flight passed in a blur, the engine’s hum a constant drone. She closed her eyes, breathing in the lingering scent of the city.

Upon descent, the landscape below revealed a new starkness. Crisp, ocean-scented air greeted her as she disembarked, the ground solid beneath her feet. Seventy-two hours.

The hotel lobby was a symphony of quiet elegance. Another blurring elevator ride, more polished steel reflecting her ghostly image. Entering her room, the scent of the ocean filled the space. The weight was there, always there, threatening to pull her under. She pushed it away.

Seventy-two hours to save her career, to save herself.

She opened her laptop, the screen casting a soft glow. The task pressed down, its gravity immense. She pushed the thoughts away and began to work.e gravity of the situation threatening to pull her under. But she pushed the thoughts away, focusing on the task at hand. She had seventy-two hours.

The weight of the task pressed down on Seventy-two hours. The number was a drumbeat in her skull, a countdown to ruin. She forced her focus onto the screen, onto the task that was her only lifeline. The data blurred, her eyes gritty with exhaustion. She blinked, and in that split-second darkness, a new line of text flickered into existence at the bottom of the encrypted file. It wasn't part of the report. It was a message, timestamped just ten minutes ago.

They know you’re looking.

Her blood turned to ice. The air left the room. This wasn’t a leak; this was a conversation. Someone was inside the system, watching her every keystroke in real time. The weight that had pressed down on her suddenly felt personal, predatory. It wasn't just the gravity of the situation anymore—it was the focused, intelligent pressure of a hunter who had just revealed they were playing with their food.

Her hand trembled as she reached for the mouse. Before she could react, the message dissolved, leaving no trace. The screen returned to its bland, damning report. But everything had changed. The race wasn't against a clock anymore; it was against a shadow that knew her name. Saving her career was meaningless if she couldn't first save her life. The seventy-two hours had just become a death sentence, and the executioner was already in the room.
