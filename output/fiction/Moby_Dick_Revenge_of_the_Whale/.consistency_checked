This is a major narrative discontinuity.", "Setting/ship inconsistency: Chapter 1 is set on the whaling ship *Rachel*, searching for lost crew.

This plot thread is completely absent in the later chapters, which follow a different storyline on the *Pequod*.", "Character knowledge/role inconsistency: In Chapter 1, Ishmael is a 'green' young sailor on the *Rachel*. In later chapters, he is a seasoned harpooner on the *Pequod*, familiar with Ahab's chart and integrated into a different crew (including Queequeg and Starbuck) with no bridging narrative."], "severity": "high"}
