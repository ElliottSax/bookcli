  "description_long": "Herman Melville\u2019s classic tale is reborn in fire, blood, and steam. The white whale that took Captain Ahab\u2019s leg is no mere beast\u2014it is a leviathan kaiju, a god of the deep whose wrath can shatter ships and drown islands. Driven by an obsession that borders on divinity, Ahab forsakes the common whaler\u2019s lance. He summons a crew of hardened monster hunters and engineers, forging a weapon of a ship armed with harpoon cannons and clad in steam-powered armor.\n\nThe stakes are no longer mere profit or revenge, but the survival of every soul upon the sea. As the Pequod II plunges into haunted waters, the crew must battle not only the apocalyptic whale but the creeping madness of their own captain. This is a story forged in steam and fury, where every man must confront what monstrous depths they will plumb for vengeance.\n\nFans of the relentless action in Nicholas Sansbury Smith\u2019s \u2018Hell Divers\u2019 and the cosmic dread of H.P. Lovecraft will be gripped by this brutal reimagining. It delivers the emotional gut-punch of a classic tragedy fused with the visceral thrill of a monster-hunting epic. Prepare for a voyage where the sea itself is a battlefield.\n\nDare to answer Ahab\u2019s call to arms. Secure your copy of *Moby Dick: Revenge of the Whale* today, and witness the legend reborn in terror.",
