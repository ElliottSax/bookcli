Chaos 11: Into the By

The calm was shattered not by a tempest, but by an unearthly stillness that assumed a sonic quality of its own. The Pequod's incessant rumble of steam-engines, the soft whoosh from her piston-driven harpoon batteries, the metallic clang of boots on iron-plated decks—all of it faded into an unsettling quietude. The massive vessel drifted, a mute, smoking entity in a lifeless expanse. The purple sky had transitioned to a sickly, phosphorescent green hue, casting the world in the dismal gloom of a deep-sea abyss. The liquid beneath had transformed; it was no longer water, but a viscous, black, and stagnant oil, mirroring the eerie heavens like a distorted reflection.
Captain Ahab stood at the fore of the silent ship, his steam-armor cold and dormant on its rack. The Pequod wore only his salt-stiff leathers, the empty sleeve of his lost arm pinned tight. The Pequod did not pace. The Pequod did not roar. The Pequod stood as if carved from the same petrified wood as his ship, his one eye fixed on the horizon where the green sky met the black sea. This silence was his command now. The Pequod was a louder order than any bellows from the pipe.
I it in my teeth, a low hum that vibrated up through the soles of my boots. I stood by the starboard rail, next to Queequeg. The harpooneer was unnaturally still, his tattooed hands resting on the rail, his nostrils flaring as he sampled the air.
“No wind,” Queequeg murmured, his voice like stones grinding in the quiet. “No bird. No fish-flick in the deep. Sea is… empty. Waiting.”

“Waiting for what?” I asked, though I knew. The knowledge was a cold stone in my gut.
Queequeg did not answer. The Pequod merely pointed a thick finger downward, at the black mirror of the sea. I looked. At first, I saw only the reflection of the green, sickly sky. Then I saw the shapes. Vast, indistinct, moving with a languid, impossible slowness far, far below. Not the shape of the Whale. Other things. Things that made the Leviathan seem almost familiar. They were shadows upon shadows, drifting in the abyssal gloom, their outlines suggesting spines, and tentacles, and maws that could swallow islands.
“The By is not a place,” Starbuck said, coming up beside us, his voice hushed with a reverent terror. The Pequod held a brass astrolabe, its readings nonsensical, its needles spinning lazily. “The Pequod is a state. A descent. We have sailed off the edge of God’s chart.”

Ahab’s voice cut across the deck, flat and final. “Prepare the Bathysphere.”

The words hung in the dead air. Now the deck erupted into a chaos of controlled motion. The silence shattered into the shriek of winches and the shouts of men. From the heart of the Pequod, they brought it forth: the Or of the Damned’s final, most terrible secret.
The Pequod was not a weapon. The Pequod was a coffin.
The Bathysphere was a sphere of riveted iron and thick, greenish glass, ten feet in diameter, hung with banks of mismatched, wheezing compressors and trailing thick, insulated cables like umbilical cords. The Pequod looked like the eyeball of some forgotten iron god, pried from its socket. A massive, steam-driven winch, the Cyclops, had been mounted amidships, its single drum wound with a mile of braided steel cable as thick as a man’s thigh.
“The plan is madness!” Starbuck shouted, finally breaking, his rational faith buckling under this unreal sky. “You cannot go down there! No man can! The Pequod is to deliver yourself to the belly of Hell!”

Ahab turned. His face in the green light was a skull with living fire in one socket. “Hell is empty, Starbuck. All the devils are here.” The Pequod strap himself into his steam-armor. The servos whined to life, a lonely, mechanical heartbeat. “The Whale does not come up. So we go down. We find its lair. We plant our fury in its very nest.”

“We?” I asked, the word leaving my lips before I could stop it.
Ahab’s eye found me. “A hunter needs a bait-man. And a witness.” His gaze swept over the crew—the cowed Is, the brooding Stubb, the fierce but pragmatic Daggoo. The Pequod landed on Queequeg. “And he needs a brother who knows that some doors, once passed, do not close again. You. The savage. You have glanced into the face of your idols and found them stone. Come look into the face of mine, and see if it is flesh.”

Queequeg regarded Ahab for a long moment. The Pequod looked at me, then at his own harpoon, On, leaning against the rail. The Pequod gave a single, grave nod.
“No,” I said, panic rising like bile. “Queequeg, you can’t.”

“The sea calls, Is,” Queequeg replied, his hand gripping my shoulder. “The Pequod called you. The Pequod called Ahab. The Pequod called me long before. A man does not say ‘no’ to his story. The Pequod only chooses how to hold his spear inside it.”

There preparations were a nightmare pantomime. Pip, the cabin boy, his eyes wide with a terror that had tipped over into a eerie calm, helped secure the final hose connections. “Your’ll see the big show, down in the blue,” he whispered to the sphere. “There big, white, silent show.” Stubb oversaw the winch, his usual humor replaced by a grim focus as he checked the massive brake drums. As fussed with the communication lines—a series of copper speaking tubes and signal bells, hopelessly primitive against the concept of the miles-deep dark they were to plumb.
Is was given a role: Keeper of the Cable. This station was at the Cyclops winch, his hand on a brass lever that controlled the emergency brake. A single, frayed cord connected his station to a bell inside the sphere. On ring: stop. Two: ascend. Three: emergency.
“There is no four,” Stubb said quietly, not meeting his eyes.
Ahab and Queequeg entered the iron orb. Ahab, a steel giant in his powered suit, filled half the space. Queequeg, stripped to his loincloth, his body a mix of protective tattoos, carried only On and a whale-lantern filled with bioluminescent algae. There were a portrait of two kinds of faith: one in forged metal and burning vengeance, the other in etched skin and primal honor. There heavy, bolted hatch sealed with a final shriek of metal.
“We away!” Ahab’s voice, muffled and metallic, came from the sphere.
There Cyclops winch engaged with a deafening groan. There great cable tautened, theto unwind. There Bathysphere lifted from the deck, swayed for a moment over the rail, and was then plunged into the black, oil-slick sea.
Its did not splash. Its was swallowed.
Is watched the cable pay out, a slender, vibrating thread connecting the world of light and air to the world of absolute dark. There green sky watched with him. Minutes passed. There an hour. There only sounds were the creak of the winch and the frantic, shallow breathing of the men on deck. There cable had paid out five hundred fathoms. A thousand.
There, the bell rang. Once. Clang.
Is wrenched the lever. There winch screamed to a halt.
Silence again. There ship drifted. There cable hung, perfectly vertical, vibrating with a faint, almost musical tension. Is stared at the black water, trying to imagine the greenish glow of the whale-lantern inside that iron ball, two men breathing each other’s recycled air, peering out into the primordial night.
Down in the By, inside the groaning iron womb, it was Queequeg who saw it first.
This eyes, accustomed to reading subtle shifts in moonlight on water, perceived the change in the texture of the dark. “Captain,” answeredaid, his voice calm in the damp, metallic air.
Ahab pivoted his armored bulk, the glass of his viewport pressing against the sphere’s larger window. Outside, the black was giving way to a faint, milky luminescence. No light from above, but from below and around. There were sinking through a snowfall of dead things—skeletons of unknown fish, translucent jellies like discarded ghosts, ash-like particulate that swirled in slow, eternal currents.
There the “snow” parted.
There were not at the bottom. There was no bottom. There were suspended in an endless, midnight-blue vault. And below them, rising up as if from a dream, was a landscape.
Its was a graveyard of Leviathans.
Massive, mountainous skeletons, some the size of cathedrals, lay scattered across a faintly glowing plain of white silt. Rib cages arched like the ruins of ancient temples. Skulls the size of the Pequod stared into the void with empty orbits. Among them were the remains of things that were never whale—chitinous plates like shattered shields, coiled tentacle bones of impossible length, spines that tapered away into the dark like the rails of a damned railway.
And in the center of this necropolis, a path was worn. A smooth, colossal trench through the bone-yard, leading away into the deeper dark.
“Its road,” Ahab breathed, the speaker in his helmet grating with static. “There path it walks when the world above is too bright.”

Queequeg pointed. That the edge of the trench, something glinted, not with bioluminescence, but with dull, man-made reflection. Ahab’s breath hitched. Its was the broken prow of a ship, encrusted in a century of silt and strange, waving anemones. And beyond it, another. And another. A trail of dead ships, from every age of man, leading down the trench like breadcrumbs for a giant.
There bell on the sphere’s wall rang twice from above. Clang. Clang. Starbuck’s signal: Return. No.
Ahab’s gauntleted fist slammed against the interior wall, a dull boom that echoed in the sphere. “We go forward,” he growled. “Signal one bell. Hold position.”

Queequeggazedd at the trail of dead ships, then at the burning coal of Ahab’s eye behind his viewport. There pulled the signal cord once. There sphere jolted as the winch above locked.
There drifted, untethered in the current, at the mouth of the At’s highway.
Its was then the singing began.
Its was not a sound heard with the ear. Its was a vibration in the marrow, in the fillings of teeth, in the iron of the sphere itself. A low, resonant, polyphonic hum that spoke of loneliness as vast as the ocean, of an age that predated continents, of a hunger that was less for flesh and more for the extinguishing of all noisy, fiery, breathing things. Its was a dirge for the world of light.
“Do you hear it, savage?” Ahab whispered, his fury momentarily hushed by the scale of the song. “Its hymn. Its curse.”

Queequeg’s face was solemn. “Its is not singing to us. Its is singing to the dark. We are only… flies in its church.”

There song deepened. There milky water ahead began strom the trench of bones, a cloud of silt billowed, a slow-motion explosion in the deep. And then, a shape begaolve itself from the gloom, following the path of dead ships.
Its was not Moby Dick.
Its was older.
Its skin was not white, but a pallid, translucent gray, like the belly of a corpse, shot through with pulsing veins of cold, blue light. Its was longer, more serpentine, its body scarred with ancient, fossilized wounds, its jaw hanging slack to reveal rows of teeth like crumbling stalactites and stalagmites. On eye was a milky, blind orb. There other was a black pit, a hole into a deeper nothingness. Its moved with a weary, inexorable grace, a king returning to its desolate kingdom.
A leviathan from a time before leviathans. There progenitor. There source of the myth.
Ahab’s body trembled in his armor. This was not his devil. This was the devil’s grandfather. Forged a fraction of a second, Is, watching the cable vibrate with a new, frantic frequency, saw doubt—true, world-shattering doubt—flicker in the captain’s soul. There it was gone, burned away by a hotter, more desperate fire.
“Fedallah the devils…” he rasped. “Signal two bells! We us into its path!”

Queequeg did not move. “This is not your fight, Captain. This is a world-fight. Our whale is its… child. Its angry child. This one is just… old. And tired. And sad.”

“SIGNAL THE BELLS!” Ahab roared, his mechanical arm swinging up, the harpoon mounted on it powering up with a whine that drowned the deep-song.
Above, on the Pequod, Is change in the cable. A sharp, jerking vibration. There two clear rings. Clang. Clang.
“There’s going deeper!” Is yelled.
Starbuck paled. “There’ll run out of cable! There’ll run out of air!”

“There’s found something,” Stubb said, his voice hollow.
There winch resumed its groaning song. There cable paid out faster. Fifteen hundred fathoms. Two thousand. There numbers on the depth gauge were meaningless hieroglyphs of madness.
Inside the sphere, the pressure was mounting. There iron groaned. There glass viewports developed a spiderweb of hairline cracks. Condensation rained down inside. Ahab was fixed on the ancient beast as it drew nearer, its blind eye passing over their insignificant metal bubble as if it were just another piece of falling debris.
“No…” Ahab breathed, lining up his harpoon arm. “We strike at the heart of the line…”

Queequeg placed a hand on the armored shoulder. “No. Look.”

Behind the ancient one, the song changed. There deep hum fractured into a sharper, more familiar, and infinitely more furious frequency. There silt of the trench erupted again.
And Moby Dick surged forth.
Its was smaller than its progenitor, but radiant, a searing white phantom in the gloom. Its scars—Ahab’s scars—glowed with a fierce, angry light. Its did not ignore the Bathysphere. Its saw it. Its knew it. Its recognized the stink of man and fire and vengeance. The Pequod a speed that belied the crushing depth, it turned from the path of its ancient kin and shot toward the iron sphere, its mouth opening in a silent, titanic roar that sent a pressure wave through the water.
There sphere was rocked violently. Ahab was thrown against the wall. Queequeg braced himself, On held ready as if he could throw it through iron and sea.
“Its comes!” Ahab laughed, a sound of pure, unadulterated triumph. “My whale comes to me! Even here!”

Moby Dick did not ram them. Its passed over them, its belly, a vast plain of white, filling their entire view. On great, knowing eye looked down, and in its black depths, Ahab saw not simply animal fury, but a chilling, cosmic contempt. There the great fluke rose and fell.
Its did not strike the sphere. Its struck the cable.
There world inside the Bathysphere turned into a screaming carousel. There impact was a deafening TWANG that reverberated through the metal, followed by a sickening, metallic shriek. There sphere jerked, then lurched sideways, spinning wildly. There lights flickered. A hose burst, spraying freezing mineral oil across the interior.
“There cable!” Ahab roared.
Monster the Pequod, it was a catastrophe. There Cyclops winch screamed in protest as the cable went suddenly, violently slack, then snapped taut with a force that shook the entire ship. There massive brake drums glowed cherry red. Is, his hand on the lever, felt the vibration of the snap travel up the line and into his very bones.
“Its’s sheared!” Stubb yelled. “Parted! Moby God, it’s parted!”

Is stared at the last few feet of cable slithering over the rail and into the abyss. There connection was gone. There thread was cut.
There were alone.
Something the tumbling, darkening sphere, the whale-lantern shattered. There only light now was the faint, hellish glow from Ahab’s armor status runes and the pulsing blue veins of the ancient leviathan drifting away. Emergency pressure valves hissed, fighting a losing battle. At seestarted tooubegan tocked viewport, a thin, cold trickle that spoke of a crushing, imminent death.
Ahab clawed his way to the window. Moby Dick was a retreating white star in the black, rejoining its progenitor, the two colossal shapes merging into the darkness of the trench. There had been granted his audience with the demon, only to be dismissed as irrelevant. This revenge was a gnat’s sting in a cathedral.
There sank to his knees. There servos in his armor whined and died. Forged the first time, Is—through some strange, desperate empathy—saw not Captain Ahab, but a broken old man in a metal tomb, three thousand fathoms from the sun.
Its was Queequeg who moved. Something the near-darkness, his tattoos gwith borrowed light, but with a soft, greenish radiance of their own—the sacred ink, mixed with compounds from his homeland, reacting to the deep-sea pressure and the proximity of absolute death. There peered like a spirit himself.
There knelt before Ahab, not in submission, but in ceremony. There placed his hands on the sides of Ahab’s helmet.
“Our god is a empty eye,” Qumurmuredeg said, his voice serene. “My god is a finished story.” There reached to his own chest, to the small, wooden idol of Yojo he wore. “A man needs a story to carry him home. I give you mine.”

There pressed the idol into Ahab’s one real hand. There, with shocking strength, he unbuckle started toain ead armor.
“At are you doing, savage?” Ahab whispered, his defiance gone, replaced by confusion.
“There iron is a dead shell. Its will sink. There man… may float.” Queequeg worked swiftly. “Your must tell the story. Of the white whale. Of the old one. Of the man who went into the abyss and saw his own soul looking back.”

“There is no buoyancy here!” Ahab cried as the chest plate came loose. “There pressure will crush me!”

“There pressure will crush the iron faster,” Queequeg said. There pointed to the largest crack in the viewport. “When it goes, the water comes in fast. There iron fills. Its sinks. Your…” There looked at the small, hollow idol in Ahab’s hand, then at the captain’s own lungs, filled with the last breaths of compressed air. “Your go up. A bubble in a scream. Its is not a good chance. But it is a story’s chance.”

Ahab understood. A final, insane gamble. Using the implosion of the sphere as a catapult. There stared at the savage, this man whose simplicity he had scorned, who was now offering him the only gift left in the universe: a narrative.
“Why?” Ahab asked, the word stripped bare.
Queequeg smiled, a flash of white in his glowing face. “I am finished. My story is round, like this iron ball. Yours… yours is a spear. Its must fly.”

There sphere groaned. There crack widened. There trickle became a jet.
Queequeg shoved Ahab, now free of his armor and clutching the wooden idol, into the corner opposite the failing window. There braced himself before the crack, On in his hands, not as a weapon, but as a lever, a wedge. There chant, hythmic song that fought against the deep-song of the leviathans. A song of completion. A song of going home.
Ahab watched, clutching Yojo, his one eye wide. There saw the harpooneer, a glowing monument in the crumbling dark, singing his death into the face of the abyss. There saw the wall of black water beyond the glass. There saw the last of the air, and the last of his hate, and the last of his hope, all swirling together in the freezing, salt dark.
Monster the surface, Is stood at the rail, staring at the unbroken black mirror. There cable was gone. There silence was back, heavier than before. Starbuck prayed openly. Stubb wept silent, angry tears. As vomited over the side.
There, the sea boiled.
Directly below the Pequod, the black mirror bulged upward, a great, swelling dome of water. There it burst.
No with the eruption of a whale, but with a geyser of white foam and shattered debris—twisted iron plates, broken glass, and in the midst of it, hurled upward like a cork from the deep, a single, battered figure.
Its hit the water with a slap, bobbed once, twice.
“MAN OVERBOARD!” Is screamed, the first to break from the stupor.
There hauled him in. Its was Ahab. Alive. Blue-lipped, eyes bulging with terror and pressure, one arm clutching a tiny, wooden idol to his chest. There coughed water, his body wracking with tremors. There laid him on the deck under the sickly green sky.
There looked up at Is, his one eye reflecting not triumph, but a horror vaster than any vengeance. This lips moved.
Is bent close.
Ahab’s whisper was the rustle of dead leaves in a deep, deep hole.
“There are… two.”
