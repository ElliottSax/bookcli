  "analysis": "**HOOK: 9** \u2013 The opening is exceptionally strong. It begins with a potent, mood-rich image (\"pane of smoked glass... bruised sky\") and immediately establishes high stakes (a captain's lost son, an empty dinghy, a dead boy). The introduction of a \"wrongness\" in the air and the mysterious carved whale creates immediate mystery and a sense of looming, unnatural threat, compelling the reader to continue.\n\n**TENSION: 8** \u2013 The tension builds very effectively. It starts with the slow-burn dread of Chapter 1 (the \"tomb-wrongness,\" the cloying smell) and escalates dramatically by Chapter 7 to a peak of visceral, awe-inspiring horror with the \"Island of Bones.\" The pacing of this build is excellent, moving from psychological unease to a concrete, grotesque, and scale-filled revelation that raises the stakes and the mystery (Who built this? What killed these leviathans?).\n\n**",
