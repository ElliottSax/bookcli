    "chapter_01.md: **SCORE: 8/10**\n\n**WRITING QUALITY:** 8/10 - Evocative, dense with atmosphere and strong imagery.\n**DIALOGUE NATURALNESS:** 7/10 - Generally fitting, though some lines feel overly expository or portentous.\n**PACING:** 8/10 - Effective build of tension and mystery to a compelling cliffhanger.\n\n**ISSUES:** minor exposition dump (\"Lost with all hands...\"), slightly over-written metaphors, chapter title duplicate.",
    "chapter_07.md: SCORE: 8/10 | ISSUES: minor adverb overuse, some exposition in dialogue, abrupt ending\n\n**Writing Quality: 9/10.** Vivid, immersive, and stylistically strong with excellent descriptive prose and a compelling, original setting.\n\n**Dialogue Naturalness: 7/10.** Generally good, but the keeper's dialogue leans into exposition (\"They are one song now...\") and Ahab's final line is cut off awkwardly.\n\n**Pacing: 8/10.** Effectively builds dread and reveals the grotesque setting. The arrival of the keeper is well-timed, but the excerpt's cutoff is jarring.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n1. **Adverb Reliance:** Several dialogue tags use adverbs (\"breathed,\" \"announced,\" \"boomed,\" \"corrected\") where stronger verb choices or context could suffice.\n2. **Expository Dialogue:** The keeper's speech verges on overly poetic exposition to explain the island's",
    "chapter_12.md: SCORE: 8/10 | ISSUES: occasional overwriting, minor dialogue inconsistency, abrupt cutoff\n\n**Writing Quality: 8/10.** Vivid, atmospheric, and immersive. Strong sensory details. Occasionally slips into overwrought prose (\"column of scarred wrath,\" \"mawing quiet\").\n\n**Dialogue Naturalness: 7/10.** Generally effective and characterful (Ahab's roar, Starbuck's report). Pip's \"Magic?\" and Flask's response feel slightly stilted and expositional.\n\n**Pacing: 9/10.** Excellent. Builds tension masterfully from deep silence to Ahab's explosive entrance, maintaining a palpable sense of dread.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n1. **Overwriting:** Some metaphors are pushed too far (e.g., \"suffocating blanket,\" \"cracks in old porcelain\").\n2. **Dialogue Tone:** Minor inconsistency; Flask's line feels more like explaining the premise to the reader.\n3."
