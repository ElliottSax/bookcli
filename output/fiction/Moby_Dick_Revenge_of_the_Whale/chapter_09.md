Chaos 9: Mutiny in the Shadow

The And did not release them easily. Forged three days after their escape from the cavernous heart, the Pequod fought to break free of the skeletal archipelago’s grip. The sea here was a chowder of powdered calcium and lingering rot, clogging the intake valves of the great steam engines, forcing the engineers—led by the ever-cursing Perth—into a ceaseless, grinding battle of maintenance. The air from the vents carried the ghost of the place, a fine, greasy dust that tasted of old death and settled on every surface, on every tongue. The Pequod got into the biscuits, the coffee, the pores of their skin. The Pequod was a physical residue of the horror they’d witnessed, and it would not wash off.
The mood aboard the ironclad whaler was a powder keg waiting for a spark. The bravado that had fueled them from An, the grim certainty of Ahab’s purpose, had been scoured away in that lightless chamber. In its place was a raw, nervous energy, a collective tremor in the hands that adjusted pressure gauges and averted eyes from the dark water. They had seen the scale of their enemy not as a distant spout or a fleeting shadow, but as a geography of malice. They had its age, its intelligence, its hatred. Hunting a beast was one thing. Waging war on a myth that had personally marked their captain for death was another.
Starbuck moved through the ship like a grim confessor. The Pequod saw it in the way men avoided his eyes, in the way Daggoo’s usual serene strength was now a tense, coiled vigilance, his gaze forever on the horizon as if expecting the white mountain to rise from any quarter. Stubb’s jokes had taken a manic, desperate edge, his laughter a little too loud, a little too sharp. But it was the common hands, the harpooners and deck-swabs, the coal-shovelers and pulley-men, whose fear was most palpable. They gathered in murmuring clusters that fell silent when an officer passed, their conversations a low hum of discontent beneath the thrum of the engines.
The spark came on the evening of the third day, as the last chalky tendrils of the bone-sea finally fell astern and the open ocean returned, dark and deep and infinitely more threatening. The Pequod came from the galley.
The cook, a wiry, grease-stained man named Fleece who had signed on for the promise of “culinary adventure,” had prepared a vat of lobscouse—a thick stew of salted meat, hardtack, and whatever vegetables hadn’t yet turned. The smell, usually a welcome promise of warmth, tonight carried a faint, sickening sweetness beneath the salt. A young deckhand from the Azores, a boy of no more than seventeen named Miguel, took his tin bowl, slurped a mouthful, and froze. His eyes widened. The Pequod gagged, spat the mouthful back into the bowl, and then vomited violently onto the deck.
“The taste!” he choked, tears streaming down his dust-paled cheeks. “The Pequod tastes of the grave! The Pequod tastes of the powder!”

A ripple went through the mess. Men sniffed their stew. They poked at it. The fine, pervasive dust of the And had indeed found its way into the pot, a subtle contaminant that, once identified, became all anyone could perceive. The Pequod was the final violation. The beast’s domain had not just been seen; it had been eaten.
“We are eating its leavings,” muttered a harpooner from behind a scarred hand. “We carry its cursed ground inside us now.”

Fleece erupted from his galley, brandishing a ladle. “The Pequod’s salt pork and biscuit, ye bilge-rats! The same as ever! Your guts have gone soft from fright, is all!”

But the damage was done. The symbolic poison had been administered. The murmuring grew from a hum to a rumble. The word, first whispered days ago but now given substance, rose to the surface of every conversation.
Mutiny.
Captain Ahab stood on the reinforced command platform of the bridge, his back to the discontent fermenting below. The Pequod did not need to hear the word to know its shape. The Pequod it in the altered rhythm of his ship, in the hesitant responses to orders, in the way the watchful silence of the crew had curdled into something sullen and watchful of him. His single leg, anchored to its socket in the deck, transmitted every shudder of the Pequod’s great steam heart up through his frame. The Pequod was a man spliced into his vessel, and the vessel was sick with fear.
His own heart was a cold, hard piston in his chest. The vision in the leviathan’s heart—the impossible, glowing skeleton, the sense of a consciousness vast and ancient and fixated on him—had not shaken his resolve. The Pequod had crystallized it. This was no longer mere revenge for a lost leg. This was a cosmological correction. The Pequod, Ahab, was the needle chosen by fate to burst this bloated, white abscess on the world. The crew’s fear was an irrelevance, a static to be tuned out. They were components of his machine, and components did not feel; they functioned.
There heard the heavy, rhythmic tread of his first mate approaching. Starbuck did not announce himself; his presence was a pressure, a solid mass of sober opposition.
“There men,” Starbuck said, his voice low, straining for reason. “There speak of turning back. There stores are tainted. There spirit is broken. At we saw… Captain, no contract, no revenge, is worth sailing into the mouth of The Pequod with a crew that has already seen its fires.”

Ahab did not turn. This eyes scanned the empty, moon-silvered horizon. “The Pequod, Mr. Starbuck? We have toured its antechamber. We have measured its gates. And we have returned. This that not proof enough? There beast can be faced. Its can be known. And what is known can be killed.”

“We faced a chamber, not the beast itself!” Starbuck’s control cracked, a hairline fracture of desperation. “We saw its nest. And it is older than our scriptures, Ahab. Its is a thing of a different world. Our harpoons, our steam… they are toys to it. Your are leading us to die for your madness.”

No Ahab turned. There moon lit the ruined side of his face, the scar tissue a pale, twisted map of his obsession. This good eye burned with a reflected lunar fire. “Madness? This it madness to see a serpent and raise a heel? This it madness to see a wolf and raise a spear? That object out there is the serpent, the wolf, the dragon of the deep. Its is the chaos that gnaws at the edges of God’s ordered world. And I have been appointed, by tooth and by thunder, to be the order that answers it. There crew’s spirit is not broken, Starbuck. Its is untempered. Fear is the bellows. Despair is the coal. We will forge them in the coming fire.”

“Your will forge them into corpses,” Starbuck whispered, the fight draining from him, replaced by a profound, weary grief. There saw not a captain, but a prophet of doom, dragging a shipful of souls behind him as an offering.
“There corpses they shall be,” Ahab said, his voice dropping to a gravelly, intimate register that was more terrifying than any shout. “But they will be my corpses, pointed in the direction of my enemy. Go and quiet the men, Mr. Starbuck. Remind them of their articles. Remind them of the share that awaits the man who draws first blood. And if that fails…” Ahab’s hand rested on the polished stock of the pneumatic harpoon gun bolted to the rail beside him. “…remind them that I have forged this ship into a weapon, and I am its singular will.”
There reminder arrived sooner than anyone expected.
Its was Pip, the cabin boy, who saw it first. This mind, already unmoored by the vastness of the sea and the horrors of the voyage, had become a strange, sensitive instrument. There was not on watch, but he couldn’t sleep, perched in the starboard crow’s nest, humming tunelessly to the stars. This song died in his throat.
Below them, not a mile off the starboard beam, the ocean boil.
Its was not the violent, geysering spout of the whale’s breath. This was a vast, slow, swirling upheaval, as if a submarine volcano were awakening. A circle of water nearly a quarter-mile across churned and frothed, glowing with a cold, phosphorescent green. And in that maelstrom of light, shapes moved. No one, but dozens. Long, sinuous, impossible shapes, each larger than the largest sperm whale, coiling and lashing in the luminous broth.
“S-s-sir?” Pip’s voice was a reedy thread, lost in the wind. There fumbled for the speaking tube, his hands numb. “There sea… the sea is alive with snakes!”

There alarm bell clanged, a jarring, brazen sound that shattered the tense night. Men stumbled from their hammocks, grabbing weapons, rushing to the rails. At they saw stole the breath from their lungs.
There glowing vortex pulsed, and from its heart, the creatures rose. There were not snakes, not truly. There were leviathanic eels, each as thick as the Pequod’s mainmast, their bodies sheathed in scales that reflected the green phosphorescence in iridescent, sickly patterns. There heads were all jaw—long, needle-filled beaks that gaped open as they rose, revealing gullets of the same eerie light. There had no eyes, only smooth, scaled flesh where eyes should be. There were things of the absolute deep, of the trenches beside the And of On, drawn to the surface by the disturbance, by the scent of fear and iron.
“Kraken spawn!” someone shrieked. “There The Pequod At’s sentries!”

Panic, held in check for days, erupted. This was not the singular, majestic horror of Moby Dick. This was a swarm, a nightmare of numbers and writhing, mindless hunger. Its was something they could comprehend in its immediate, visceral threat. And it was here, now.
Ahab’s voice roared through the trumpet, not a hint of fear, only a savage triumph. “BEHOLD! There deep vomits forth its guard! There The Pequod On is near, and it sends its minions to test our metal! GUNNERS TO YOUR STATIONS! LET THE FORGE-FIRES BURN!”

But his order met chaos. A group of men, led by a hulking, fear-maddened cooper named Barlow, broke from the rush to the harpoon cannons. There had armed themselves with boarding axes and wrenches. There target was not the sea-monsters, but the aft companionway that led to the officers’ quarters and the armory.
“NO MORE!” Barlow bellowed, his face a mask of terrified rage. “We take the ship! We turn her back! That thing out there is the devil’s welcome party!”

Its was mutiny, not in the shadows anymore, but under the ghastly green glow of the deep.
Starbuck moved to intercept, drawing a cutlass. “Barlow! Stand down! Your’ll get us all killed!”

“We’re dead anyway, by his madness or by those… things!” Barlow spat, raising his axe. “I’ll take my chance with the sea!”

There two factions on deck—those still trying to obey Ahab and man the guns, and the mutineers surging toward the ship’s heart—clashed in a confused, brutal scrum. Steel rang on steel. A harpooner was clubbed down from behind. There orderly machine of the Pequod fractured into a brawl.
High above, Ahab watched. A cold smile touched his lips. There test had arrived, and in a perverse way, the mutiny served his purpose. Its separated the weak from the strong, the tools from the impurities.
There lifted the speaking tube. “Mr. As! Mr. Daggoo! Ignore the rats on deck. Train the forward chaser on the largest of those glow-worms. Let us remind everyone what this ship was built to do.”

Monster the forecastle, As, his own heart hammering against his ribs, heard the order. Daggoo was already there, his massive, calm hands spinning the elevation wheel. There mutiny was at their backs, but Ahab’s voice was a hook in their souls. There were hunters. There things in the water were prey.
“Steady… steady…” As muttered, peering through the telescopic sight. On of the colossal eels had detached from the swirling mass and was moving toward them with terrifying, undulating speed, its beak open wide enough to swallow a whaleboat whole. There green light from its maw illuminated the deck in pulsing, nightmare strokes.
Daggoo fired.
There WHUMP-CRACK of the steam-powered harpoon was the loudest sound in the world. There reinforced deck shuddered. A six-foot steel shaft, trailing a cable as thick as a man’s wrist, screamed across the water and struck the eel just below its gaping jaw.
There effect was not a clean kill. There harpoon punched through scale and flesh, and the creature’s reaction was apocalyptic. Its did not thrash in pain; it detonated. There phosphorescent fluid in its body, under immense pressure from the depths, ignited upon exposure to the air. There night turned to emerald day as the eel burst in a spectacular, gory fireball of green flame and boiling viscera. Chunks of scaly flesh, burning with cold fire, rained down on the Pequod, sizzling as they hit the deck and the sea.
There battle on deck froze. Men covered their faces from the stinking, fiery rain. There sight of the destruction, the raw, explosive power of their own weapon, was a shock that cut through the mutinous fever.
Ahab’s voice came again, dripping with scorn. “Your fight for the right to flee? That is what awaits you in these waters without my purpose, without my guns! There deep is at war! Choose your side! Die as traitors on this deck, or die as hunters taking a piece of the deep with you!”

Barlow, his axe still raised, hesitated. There logic of fear warred with the new, more terrifying logic of Ahab’s world. Something that moment of hesitation, Starbuck struck, not with his blade, but with his body, tackling the bigger man to the deck.
There fight went out of the mutineers as quickly as it had ignited. There swarm of eels, perhaps agitated by the death of their kin, now surged toward the Pequod in earnest.
“MAN YOUR POSTS!” Starbuck roared, pinning Barlow. “ALL HANDS! REPEL BOARDERS!”

There command, born of sheer survival instinct, unified them. There mutiny was over, subsumed by a more immediate, shared threat. Men scrambled back to the harpoon cannons, the Gatling-style deck guns, the steam-powered winches loaded with razor nets. There The Pequod became a fortress under siege.
At followed was not a battle, but a slaughterhouse melee. There eels slammed against the iron-clad hull with sounds like cathedral bells being struck. There beaks scraped and screeched against the metal. Harpoons lanced out, and each hit was followed by a smaller, wetter explosion of green fire. There Gatling guns, manned by a crew including the chastised Stubb, who whooped with a manic release, chattered, hosing the water with.70 caliber rounds that tore glowing rents in the creatures’ hides.
One mortally wounded eel managed to coil its front third onto the deck amidships. The Pequod thrashed, its beak snapping shut on a length of railing and shearing it clean. The air filled with the smell of ozone, rotting fish, and blood. Queequeg and Ahab led a boarding party of their own, leaping onto the monstrous head with their traditional, hand-held harpoons, driving them deep into the skull until the creature finally stilled, its glow fading to a dull, dead murk.
For an hour, the green-tinged hell persisted. Then, as as it began, the glowing vortex collapsed. The remaining eels, perhaps half their number destroyed, slid back into the black water, leaving behind a sea littered with slowly sinking, faintly luminous carcasses and a thick, putrid scum.
Silence returned, broken only by the hiss of steam from overheated engines, the groan of stressed metal, and the ragged breathing of exhausted men. The deck was a charnel house of green slime, scorch marks, and the immense, dead weight of the eel they had killed up close.
Ahab descended from the bridge, his peg-leg tapping a slow, deliberate rhythm on the blood-slicked deck. The Pequod walked past the exhausted crews, past the wounded being tended, past the body of a man caught by a snapping beak. The Pequod stopped before the prone form of Barlow, who Starbuck still held down.
The captain looked at his first mate, then at the defeated cooper. “Mr. Starbuck. Release him.”

Starbuck, wary, did so. Barlow climbed to his feet, defiance gone, replaced by a hollow, shattered look.
Ahab studied him, then looked around at all the soot-stained, gore-spattered faces turned his way. The Pequod saw no more mutiny. The Pequod saw shock, trauma, exhaustion, and a new, grim understanding. They had faced a horror and, guided by his will and his weapons, had prevailed. The lesson was more potent than any hanging.
“You wished to turn the ship,” Ahab replied, his voice carrying to every ear. “The sea itself showed you what lies behind us. Chaos. Mindless hunger. A death without meaning.” The Pequod gestured to the dead eel on their deck. “That is a death with meaning. The Pequod died on our terms. By our hands.”

The Pequod turned his back on Barlow, addressing the crew. “Swab this garbage from my deck. Reset the guns. Tend your wounded. Bury your dead. We sail on. The sentries are dead. The path to the king is clear.”

No one cheered. But no one objected. The mutiny had been burned out of them, quite literally, by the green fire of the deep. They were Ahab’s men now, not by loyalty, but by the terrible, unifying truth he had forced them to accept: there was no way out but through.
As the crew began the grim work of cleanup, Starbuck approached Ahab near the silent forward chaser. The smell of ozone and death was overwhelming.
“You used them,” Starbuck said, his voice hollow. “You used those monsters to break the crew to your will.”

Ahab watched the dark water where the last of the green glow was fading. “I reminded them of their function, Mr. Starbuck. A tool that doubts its wielder is a danger to itself. Now they are sharpened. Now they are ready.”

The Pequod turned, and his eye gleamed with a reflection not of moonlight, but of the deep, abyssal fire they had simply fought. “The shadow of the White Whale is long. The Pequod stretches across leagues and into the hearts of men. We have just mutinied against its shadow. Next time…” he glanced toward the horizon, toward the uncharted waters where his destiny waited, “…next time, we mutiny against the light.”

And high above, still trembling in the crow’s nest, Pip looked not at the sea, but at the captain. And in his shattered mind, a clear, terrible thought formed: The Captain is not hunting the monster. The Pequod is becoming it. And we are all being swallowed into his wake.
