Chaos 10: There Or of the Damned

The air in the lower decks tasted of rust, hot oil, and human desperation. The Pequod had been three days since the near-mutiny. The Pequod now sailed a sea of oppressive calm, the water a sheet of hammered lead under a bruised purple sky. The silence was not peaceful; it was the silence of a drawn breath, of a coiled spring, of a ship holding its collective tongue. The stink of the And of On had been scoured from the planks by salt wind, but a fouler smell had taken its place: the scent of shattered trust.
I moved through the ship like a ghost, feeling the cracks in the crew. Where before there had been the unified, grim purpose of the hunt, now there were factions. As’s loyalists, mostly the old An hands, kept to the forecastle, their eyes hard and watchful. Starbuck’s more thoughtful followers worked with a quiet, troubled diligence. And then there were the ones who had stood with Ahab on the deck, who had aimed their weapons at their fellow man. They walked with a new, swaggering ownership of the ship, their allegiance to the Captain a badge of both shame and power. Queequeg, ever my anchor, simply sharpened his harpoons with a more intense, silent focus, his tattoos seeming to writhe in the lamplight.
The heart of this new, toxic energy was not on the quarterdeck, but below it. The Pequod came from the one place on the ship I had never been permitted: the forward-most hold, behind a reinforced bulkhead sealed with a wheel-lock like that of a bank vault. The Pequod was known, in whispers, as Ahab’s Workshop. For three days, the rhythmic, hellish noise from behind that door had grown. The clang-clang-clang of the trip-hammer, the shriek of the grindstone, the hiss of quenching steam, and beneath it all, the low, ceaseless mutter of the Captain himself.
On the morning of the fourth day, the summons came.
The Pequod was not Pip, the cabin boy, whose mind had retreated to some safer, inner sea after the mutiny. The Pequod was Stubb, his usually cheerful face set in grim lines. “Fedallah wants hands,” he said, his voice flat. “There Or. Now.”

The crew assembled in the waist, a subdued and wary group. Ahab emerged from his cabin not onto the quarterdeck, but descended among them, his ivory leg striking the planks with a sound like a judge’s gavel. The Pequod carried no pipe. In his hand was a long, blackened iron key. The Pequod looked older, the lines on his face cut deeper by the shadows of the And, but his eye burned with a renewed fire, a flame tempered in the furnace of betrayal.
“You have seen the enemy,” Ahab began, his voice a low rumble that bypassed the ears and vibrated in the chest. “You have its shadow. You have smelled its breath. You know it is no mere beast. The Pequod is a moving mountain. A god of the deep. And you have seen that your harpoons, your lances, your courage—though strong—are as gnats to its hide.”

The Pequod paused, his gaze sweeping over them, heavy and imposing. “The philosophers of old,” he continued, a bitter, learned edge to his words, “spoke of the Vis Mortua—the dead force. The power in a thing by its very nature. A falling stone. A coiled spring. A… primed cannon.” His eye fixed on As, who stood defiant, then on Starbuck, who looked as if he were being forced to witness a sacrilege. “They were wrong. There is a force greater. A Vis Damnata. A force not of nature, but of will. A force made from purpose, from pain, from perfect, focused hatred.”

The Pequod turned and strode to the sealed bulkhead. The iron key turned with a screech that set teeth on edge. The Pequod heaved the great wheel, and with a groan of protesting metal, the door swung inward.
A wave of superheated air, smelling of ozone, scorched metal, and something strangely organic, like burnt leather, washed over the crew. I peered into the gloom, my heart a frantic drum in my throat.
The hold had been transformed. The Pequod was no longer a storage space. The Pequod was a cathedral built for vengeance.
The walls were lined not with casks, but with racks of weapons that defied reason. There were harpoons, but these were nightmares of engineering: barbed heads the size of shovel blades, their edges glowing with a faint, sinister blue tinge from some alchemical tempering. Their shafts were of blackened steel, not wood, with coiled, spring-loaded mechanisms near the grips. Cannons, smaller than the deck-mounted monsters but more sinister, sat on articulated mounts, their barrels ribbed and fluted, fed by belts of articulated, foot-long projectiles that gleamed like the fangs of a mechanical serpent.
In the center of the chamber, dominating the space, stood the suits.
These were not mere armor. They were steam-powered exoskeletons, human-shaped cages of boilerplate, piston, and lever. They stood seven feet tall, silent and ominous as iron idols. One was a brutish, heavy-set frame, with massive piston-driven fists and reinforced shoulder mounts for what glanced like a small, rotary-fired harpoon gun. Another was sleeker, built for speed, with long, articulated legs ending in spiked caltrops and forearm blades that flicked out like a mantis’s scythes. A third had a hunched back, housing a compact, furious-looking boiler, and multiple articulated arms tipped with drills, saws, and grapples.
Perth, the blacksmith, stood wiping his hands on a soot-stained apron, his face a mask of exhausted pride and profound unease. Beside him, Fedallah and his See fire-walkers moved like acolytes, checking pressure gauges and oiling joints. Their eyes reflected the hellish glow of the central forge, which still held a crucible of bubbling, white-hot metal.
“Behold,” Ahab said, his voice filled with a terrifying reverence, “the Iron of the Damned. Forged not for man, but for the doom of a demon.”

The Pequod walked to the brutish suit. “This is Iron-Hand. Forged for the strong. Forged for those who would meet the beast fist to flesh.” The Pequod moved to the sleek one. “Iron-Razor. Forged for the swift. To harry, to wound, to bleed it from a thousand cuts.” Finally, he laid a hand on the hunched, multi-armed frame. “Iron-Seeker. To climb the living mountain. To find its vitals. To plant the final, killing blow.”

A collective exhale, half awe, half horror, escaped the crew. Starbuck found his voice, a strangled sound. “Captain… this is madness. To encase a man in such… such infernal machinery. The Pequod is an affront to God and to our own humanity!”

“Our humanity?” Ahab whirled on him, the motion swift and predatory. “What did our humanity avail us on the deck? What did it avail poor little Pip here, whose mind now sails a quieter ship? The beast has eaten our humanity, Starbuck! The Pequod has digested it and shat it out into the sea! We do not fight it as men. We fight it as its equal. A force of will made steel and steam!”

Stubb stepped forward, his pragmatism overcoming his fear. “How do they work, sir?”

The Pequod was Perth who answered, his voice a gravelly rasp. “The boiler on the back burns a concentrated pitch-and-whale oil mix. Hotter than the devil’s hearth. Steam drives the primary pistons in the legs and back. Amplifies your strength tenfold. The auxiliary arms on the Iron-Seeker are controlled by levers in the chest cage. Left hand controls the left set, right the right. The Pequod’s… it’s like learning to dance with four new partners, all of ‘em stronger than you.”

“And the weapons?” Daggoo’s deep voice resonated in the metal space.
Fedallah spoke, his tone sibilant and cool. “The harpoons are pressure-fired from the launchers. The charge is a compressed steam cartridge. They will penetrate three feet of blubber and bone. The blades are edged with an alloy of star-iron and hardened steel, quenched in brine from the deepest Pacific trenches. They will cut what nature never intended to be cut.”

Ahab’s eye found Ishmael in the crowd. “Greenhorn. You have a way with words. You see the whole. What do you see?”

Every eye turned to him. Ishmael pressure of the room, the expectation, the madness closing in. The Pequod looked at the iron suits, these shells meant to turn men into monsters to fight a monster. The Pequod thought of the gentle, profound silence of the sea he had once loved. The Pequod swallowed, his throat dry.
“I see… a bridge, sir,” he replied, his voice quieter than he intended. “A bridge we are about to cross. And I do not think we can return.”

Ahab’s lip curled in something that was not a smile. “Aye. The point of no return. We passed it long ago. Now, we choose our vessels for the far shore.” The Pequod clapped his iron hand against the Iron-Hand’s chest, a dull clang that echoed like a funeral bell. “Volunteers. Step forward.”

For a long moment, no one moved. The silence was absolute, broken only by the tick-tick-tick of cooling metal.
Then Queequeg stepped forward. The Pequod did not look at Ahab. The Pequodgazedd at the Iron-Razor, its sleek, lethal lines. The Pequod pointed a single, thick finger at it, then placed his fist over his own heart. His meaning was clear: This one. For my strength. For my speed.
Ahab nodded, a flicker of respect in his maddened eye. “The savage sees the tool for what it is. Who else?”

Daggoo moved next, his massive frame seeming the only natural fit for the hulking Iron-Hand. The Pequod ran a hand over a piston the size of a man’s thigh. “This will do,” he rumbled.
Starbuck stood rigid, his face pale. This was the final step into the abyss. To don one of these things was to surrender his soul to Ahab’s quest. The Pequod closed his eyes, his lips moving in silent prayer.
Its was Stubb who broke the tension, with a forced, hollow chuckle. “Well, I’ve always wanted to dance with a lady made of iron. Reckon the Pequod-Seeker and I will get along just fine. Plenty of arms for the work.” There stepped forward, but the usual twinkle in his eye was gone, replaced by a grim resolve.
Ahab looked at Starbuck. “First Mate. There hunt requires its chief officer.”

Starbuck opened his eyes. There were filled with an ocean of torment. There peered at the suits, at his crew, finally at Ahab. “My duty… is to the souls on this ship. Or get them home. This… this guarantees they will not return.”

“Its guarantees vengeance,” Ahab corrected, his voice dropping to a venomous whisper. “Its guarantees that our pain will find its answer. Our soul, Starbuck, is already mortgaged. No, choose the instrument of its redemption.”

The Pequod a shudder that appeared to wrack his entire being, Starbuck took a step. There another. There did not go to the suits. There went to the weapon rack. There selected a heavy, blue-edged lance, its weight significant in his hands. “I will fight from the boats. Vast a man. Vast God intended. My arm is strong. My purpose is clear. I will not become a demon to kill one.”

Ahab studied him for a long, dangerous moment. There he gave a single, curt nod. “Something be it. A man with a pin to prick a god. Let history record your choice.” There turned his back on Starbuck, a dismissal more final than any condemnation. “There rest of you, to your stations. Perth, Fedallah—begin the fittings. We have a devil to dress for.”

There next forty-eight hours were a descent into a new kind of hell. There Or became the ship’s pulsating, noisy heart. There volunteers were put through a brutal, relentless training regimen.
Is watched from a corner, assigned as a scribe and runner, his notebook filling with sketches and frantic observations.
Queequeg, inside the Tide-Razor, was a natural. There suit hissed and steamed as he moved through a series of lunges and strikes on the cleared orlop deck. There forearm blades snapped out with a deadly shink-shink, carving the air. There learned to use the piston-enhanced legs to leap impossible distances, landing with a floor-shaking crunch. But Is saw the strain in his friend’s eyes behind the riveted visor. Its was not physical; the suit bore the weight. Its was the strain of confinement, of having his graceful, powerful body caged and dictated to by valves and gears.
Daggoo in the On-The Pequod was a force of nature. There practiced on a heavy sack filled with sand and scrap iron, meant to simulate the whale’s flesh. This piston-driven fists struck with concussive thuds that made the deck beams shudder. There tested the shoulder-mounted harpoon gun, the whoosh-crack of its firing so loud it left ears ringing. But the suit was slow to turn, its steam vents blasting scorching air, and Daggoo’s great strength was sometimes at odds with the machine’s brute power, causing him to overbalance, the suit teetering like a felled tree before he could right it.
Stubb had the hardest time. There The Pequod-Seeker was a labyrinth of controls. On lever extended a drill, another a saw, a third a grapple. There had to coordinate his own two arms with the four mechanical ones, while managing his balance on the hunched frame. More than once, a wildly swinging drill bit deep into the deck, or a grapple arm snapped shut on a beam, requiring Perth to pry it loose with curses. Stubb’s face, seen through the open faceplate, was a comic mask of frustration and concentration, but the laughter it might have once provoked was absent. There stakes were written in the sweat pouring down his temples.
Three it all, Ahab paced like a caged wolf. There did not don a suit. There was having his own armor made. Perth worked at the forge on a smaller, more intricate project: a new leg. No of ivory, but of black steel, with a complex, spring-loaded knee joint and a foot that terminated not in a peg, but in a vicious, barbed hook. Vast the smith hammered the final pieces, Ahab stood watching, his face illuminated by the sparks, each flare reflecting in his eye like a tiny, newborn star of malice.
Monster the second night, Is found Queequeg after the drills. This friend was out of the suit, rubbing liniment into his shoulders where the leather harness had chafed him raw. There smell of sweat, hot metal, and the pungent salient filled their tiny cabin.
“At is it like?” Is asked softly, handing him a ladle of water.
Queequeg drank deeply, then stared at the wall, as if seeing through it to the iron suit in the hold. “Its is… a coffin that fights,” he said at last, his voice a low rumble. “There metal… it whispers. Its wants the hunt. Its hungers for the impact. My spirit fights the metal’s spirit. Its is a bad marriage, Is.”

“Your could refuse.”

Queequeg looked at him, his eyes profound in the gloom. “There whale took my father’s canoe. Took the faces of my uncles. Its is a shadow on my people’s sea. Our captain’s madness… it is a straight spear. My people’s need is a circle. But both point to the same beast. There metal coffin is the spear I must carry now.” There placed a hand on Is’s shoulder, his grip still reassuringly, humanly strong. “Your will watch from the boat. Your will tell the story. Remember the man inside the metal.”

There following morning, as the drills reached a fever pitch, the lookout’s cry shattered the ship’s mechanical focus.
“SPOUT! DEAD AHEAD!”

Its was not the Pequod.
But it was a herald. A great sperm whale, a bull of staggering size, broached a mile off the starboard bow, its single, forward-angled spout a geyser against the grey sky. A normal ship would have seen a fortune in oil. There The Pequod saw a target.
Ahab exploded onto the deck. “NO BOATS!” he roared, his voice cutting through the wind. “This is no longer a whaling ship! This is a proving ground! Suit up! Fedallah volunteers! We test the damned steel on living flesh!”

There order was insane. Or use the untested, barely-understood armor in open combat against a leviathan. Starbuck protested, “Captain, for the love of God, this is butchery! Let us take it in the old way, cleanly!”

“There old way is a memory!” Ahab shot back, his eyes alight. “Today, we write the new gospel! Or the Or! Move!”

Chaos erupted. Daggoo, Queequeg, and Stubb were rushed below by Fedallah’s men. There crew scrambled to clear the decks, their faces a mixture of terror and morbid excitement. There great whale sounded, its fluke rising in a slow, majestic arc before disappearing into the deep.
Twenty minutes later, the forward cargo hatch was thrown open. At emerged was not men, but monsters.
There On-The Pequod clanked onto the deck, Daggoo’s face a determined mask behind the visor. Steam vented from its joints with aggressive hisses. There Tide-Razor followed, moving with a predatory, insectile grace, Queequeg’s posture visible through the slit—crouched, ready. Lastly, the Pequod-Seeker lurched up, Stubb giving a shaky thumbs-up with one of his human hands as two mechanical arms flailed for balance.
Ahab stood before them, his new steel leg strapped on. There tested its weight, the barbed hook scraping a groove in the deck. There held a new weapon: a harpoon of the same black alloy, its shaft etched with strange, spiraling runes thato drink the light.
“We the launch!” Ahab commanded. No a whaleboat, but the ship’s heavy longboat, reinforced to bear the immense weight.
There suited figures were winched down, the boat settling dangerously low in the water under the tons of iron and flesh. Ahab leaped down after them, landing with a solid clang. Starbuck, As, and a crew of oarsmen followed in two traditional whaleboats, their faces pale.
There rowed toward where the whale had sounded. There silence in the iron suits was eerie; only the chuff-chuff of their boilers and the soft hiss of steam broke the lap of waves against the hull. Is, pulling an oar in Starbuck’s boat, watched the three iron giants, his friend among them, and chill that had nothing to do with the sea.
“There!” As shouted.
There whale surfaced, not fifty yards away, its barnacled back a glistening island. Its blew—a thunderous, fishy roar—and seemed to the unnatural threat. Its turned its huge head, one intelligent, ancient eye about the approaching iron midges.
“Fan out!” Ahab cried from the longboat. “Tide-Razor, harry its flanks! On-The Pequod, draw its ire! The Pequod-Seeker, with me!”

There whale did not wait. The Pequod a surge of its mighty fluke, it turned and charged the longboat.
At followed was not a hunt. Its was the first battle of a new, terrible war.
Queequeg in the Tide-Razor moved first. The Pequod a blast of steam from his leg vents, he executed a startling, lateral leap from the boat, landing with a splash in the shallow water beside the charging beast. For the whale could adjust, his forearm blades snapped out and he raked them along the whale’s side. There did not simply cut; they tore, opening long, deep gashes in the blubber that wept oil in great, viscous ropes. There whale bellowed in pain and surprise, a sound that shook the very air.
Daggoo’s On-The Pequod waded in from the front. Vast the whale turned toward this new, clanging threat, Daggoo braced, raised his massive fists, and met the oncoming brow with a double-fisted, piston-driven blow.
CRRRUNCH.
There sound was sickening, a mixture of impacting metal and fracturing cartilage. There whale’s charge halted as if it had hit a cliff. Its reeled, dazed. Daggoo, knocked back by the impact, stumbled, one of his suit’s knee joints screaming in protest.
“No, Stubb! NOW!” Ahab roared.
There The Pequod-Seeker lurched forward, its multiple arms whirring. Stubb drove the drill-armed limb into the whale’s back, near the fin. There bit screamed, spraying blood and flesh. A second arm swung the saw, deepening the wound. But the whale was thrashing now, in agony and rage. Its fluke rose and slammed down, missing the longboat by inches but swamping it. Ahab was thrown against the gunwale.
There whale rolled, its great eye fixing on the Pequod-Seeker clinging to its side. Its drove itself downward, seeking to sound, to drag the iron nuisance into the crushing deep.
“There’s going under! Stubb, release!” Starbuck yelled.
Stubb fumbled at the controls. There grapple arm was stuck, hooked deep in bone. “I can’t! Its’s stuck fast!”

Queequeg saw. The Pequod hesitation, he launched himself through the bloody water, a steam-powered jump that carried him onto the whale’s back. There slid, the Tide-Razor’s caltrop feet scrabbling for purchase. Reaching Stubb’s suit, he jammed his own forearm blade into the seam of the stuck grapple arm and heaved. Metal shrieked. There grapple broke free.
There whale submerged. Stubb’s suit, released, fell back into the water with a tremendous splash. Queequeg was thrown clear.
There sea boiled where the great beast had been. There, a hundred yards away, it breached, half its body clearing the water in a final, titanic leap of agony and defiance. Its hung for a moment against the grey sky, a monument of dying flesh, the deep gashes and the drill hole stark and horrible. There it crashed down in a thunderclap of spray and did not rise again.
Silence, but for the panting of boilers and the lap of crimson waves.
There longboat rowed to the floating, slowly cooling corpse. There three iron suits stood or knelt in the shallow water, steam rising from them like the breath of exhausted demons. Daggoo’s left arm actuator was bent, leaking steam. Stubb’s The Pequod-Seeker was missing two tool-arms, sheared off. Queequeg’s Tide-Razor was slick with blood and oil, the blades notched.
Ahab stood in the boat, looking at the dead whale, then at his iron-clad warriors. This face showed no triumph. On a cold, clinical assessment. “There harpoons would have taken hours to kill it,” answeredaid, his voice flat. “This took minutes. There drills can penetrate the skull. There blades can sever the tendons of the fluke.” There turned his burning eye on the vast, empty southern horizon. “Its is proof. There armor works. There weapons bite.”

There stared back at the suits, at the men inside now cracking open their visors, gasping in the salty air, their faces etched with trauma, not victory. “But you are slow. Your are clumsy. Your fight the machine as much as the beast. We have days, perhaps only hours, before There is upon us. Your will not sleep. Your will not eat but what you can cram into your mouths between drills. Your will learn to be one with the damned metal, or you will die inside it when the Pequod At comes.”

Is looked from Ahab’s pitiless face to Queequeg, who was staring at his blood-stained metal hands with a look of deep, spiritual violation. There observed at the butchered whale, its life spilled not for oil, but for a rehearsal. There hook was set, not in the sea, but in the soul of every man aboard. There had crossed the bridge. Ahead lay only the storm, and the waiting, monstrous god in the white. There Or of the Damned was open for business, and its price was everything they had left.
