Chapter 1: The Legacy of Thorns

The chalk dust in Lecture Hall Three tasted of old bones and forgotten spells. Lyra Thorne tried to focus on the rune she was meant to be inscribing in the air, a simple luminescence charm, but the grit on her tongue was a distraction. Or maybe it was just the taste of her own fear. Around her, thirty other final-year students of Arcanum Finis murmured incantations, their hands weaving light into being. The air hummed with clean, competent magic—apple-blossom bright and summer-rain fresh. Lyra’s space stayed stubbornly dark.

“Concentration, Miss Thorne,” Professor Briarwood intoned, her voice like two sheets of parchment rubbing together. She stood at Lyra’s shoulder, a silhouette of severe black wool and disappointed expectation. “The proctor from the Grand Collegium is watching. This is your final practical assessment.”

Lyra knew. She could feel the proctor’s gaze—a pinprick of cold pressure between her shoulder blades. She took a shuddering breath. The hall’s air was always too thick, too warm, smelling of nervous sweat and ozone. She extended her right hand, fingers trembling slightly, and began the somatic form: a spiral from the heart, outward. She felt the familiar, faint stirring in her blood, a warmth that was uniquely her own. It began to gather in her palm, a soft, gold-tinged glow.

Then, the stutter.

It was a sensation not of snapping, but of sinking. Like the floor of her own magical core had developed a sudden, soft spot. The warmth drained away, not violently, but with a sickening, irrevocable seep. The fledgling light in her palm guttered, choked on nothing, and died. Her hand, still held aloft, was just a hand—pale, dotted with a faint spray of freckles, utterly mundane.

A snicker cut through the scholarly silence. It came from the next bench over, where Valerius of the Aureate Line stood, his own luminescence charm not merely glowing but sculpted into a perfect, radiant lily. He didn’t look at her. He didn’t need to. The angle of his chin, the slight, pitying curve of his smile said everything. Prince Charming’s get, Lyra thought with a familiar, acidic resentment. Of course his magic works like a song. Ours was always more of a scream.

“Failure,” Professor Briarwood sighed, the word final as a tombstone settling. She made a note on her wax tablet. The sound of the stylus was obscenely loud. “Theory alone cannot carry you, Miss Thorne. Not here. Not with your… particular lineage. The Spindle’s curse does not excuse a lack of foundational control.”

Lyra lowered her hand, her face burning. She could feel the other stares now, not mocking like Valerius’s, but wary, distant. They were all descendants here, their bloodlines recorded in the gilt-edged ledgers of the Archive: children of clever tailors and brave youngest sons, of beanstalk climbers and wolf-slayers. Their legacies were stories of triumph. Hers was a footnote of perpetual sleep, a w
