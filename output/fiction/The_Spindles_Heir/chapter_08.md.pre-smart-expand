Chapter 8: Grimm's Truth

The air in Headmistress Grimm’s study tasted of old paper, beeswax, and something colder, like the breath of a deep cellar. It was a room that seemed to absorb sound, the heavy velvet drapes and shelves of leather-bound books swallowing the frantic energy that had carried Lyra, Kaelen, and Elara through the door. Valerius wasn’t with them; he lay in the infirmary, a lattice of grey, thorn-like veins creeping up his neck, his breathing shallow. His absence sat like a weight on Lyra’s chest, a reminder that this confrontation came from pure desperation.

Grimm stood before the cold hearth, not behind her imposing desk. She looked smaller without the mantle of authority, her severe black gown hanging loose, the silver brooch at her throat—a stylized spindle—seeming to pull her downward. Her face was a landscape of exhaustion, the kind etched not by sleepless nights, but by centuries.

“You should not be here,” she said, her voice not sharp, but hollow. “You should be tending to your friend.”

“We know about the garden,” Lyra said, her own voice steadier than she felt. The memory of the blighted plot behind the clocktower, where spindle-thorns grew in vicious, crystalline clusters, pulsed behind her eyes. “The thorns poisoning Val. We know they’re tied to the petrifications. To me.”

Kaelen stepped forward, placing a worn, leather-bound ledger on a side table. “And we know about the cover-ups. The ‘transfers’ that never arrived at another academy. The supplies of quicklime and linen ordered every time a student is found… still.” His usual bravado was gone, replaced by a grim, scholarly resolve. “You’ve been hiding the true toll.”

Elara, her fingers tracing the whorls of wood on her staff, added quietly, “The wards around this place aren’t just for protection. They’re a cage. We felt it when we broke through to the garden. This whole academy is a lid on a pot that’s about to boil over.”

Headmistress Grimm did not deny it. She simply looked at them, and in her grey eyes, Lyra saw the last defenses crumble. It wasn’t surrender, but a kind of weary relief.

“A lid,” Grimm echoed. “Yes. A seal. The oldest and most desperate kind.” She gestured to a worn sofa. “Sit. You’ve run headlong into the truth; you deserve to see the shape of it. Though you’ll wish you hadn’t.”

They sat, perched on the edge. Grimm remained standing, her back to the empty grate, as if drawing strength from the soot-stained stone.

“The world you know—of magic, of talking beasts, of wishes that sometimes come true—is a remnant,” she began, her words falling into the quiet room like stones into a dark pool. “It’s the fading echo of the Age of Tales. And every tale, child, has an ending.”

She walked to a bookshelf, not pulling a book out, but pressing a hidden catch. A section swung inward with a soft sigh, revealing not a hidden room, but a window. Except it didn’t look out onto the moonlit academy grounds. It showed a vast, silent, gr
