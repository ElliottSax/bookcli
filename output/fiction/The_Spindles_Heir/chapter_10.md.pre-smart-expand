Chapter 10: Crown of Thorns

The silence didn’t arrive with a roar, but with a sigh. It began in the East Wing, in the old Alchemical Lecture Hall where the air was always thick with the ghost of sulphur and forgotten reactions. A student, a third-year with an affinity for coaxing light from crystals, was the first to see it. She described it later, in a voice that never quite lost its tremor, as a “hole in the world.” Not a darkness, but an absence. A grey so profound it leached the colour from the stone archways, the polished oak benches, the very air around it. It didn’t spread; it unmade. Where it passed, sound died. The distant clamour of the panicked academy, the scuff of boots on flagstones, the frantic beating of her own heart—all were swallowed. Then came the stillness of form. The lecture hall’s eternal dust motes hung frozen in shafts of terrified sunlight. A spilled inkpot ceased its spread, becoming a glossy black lake caught in time. And the student herself, her hand outstretched in a futile gesture of warding, felt a terrible cold seep up from the floor, through her boots, into her bones. By the time the grey wave reached her desk, she was already a statue of perfect, silent fear.

The news reached Lyra in the Headmistress’s study not by word, but by the sudden, chilling quiet that crept under the door. The argument—Grimm’s cold pragmatism, Valerius’s weakening protests, Lyra’s own furious, frightened questions—stuttered and died. It was the silence of a tomb, not a building. Grimm’s face, already pale, went ashen. She moved to the window, her movements stiff.

“It is here,” she said, her voice flat. “The Stillness has chosen its point of entry. The heart of the academy.”

Lyra joined her at the window. The courtyard below was a study in surreal horror. From the gaping maw of the East Wing archway, a wave of formless grey was pouring, silent and inexorable as tide. It was not smoke, nor shadow. It was the concept of entropy given shape. Where it touched the vibrant autumn ivy, the leaves turned brittle and grey, not dying but ceasing to have ever lived. A stone gargoyle, mid-snarl, was subsumed; its features smoothed into bland, anonymous stone. The wave made no sound, but the academy screamed around it—shouts of alarm, the crackle of defensive spells fizzling into nothing upon contact, the terrible, sharp cracks as living things were rendered inert.

“Your bargain,” Lyra whispered, her throat tight. “It’s come to collect.”

“It has come to consume,” Grimm corrected, her knuckles white on the windowsill. “The balance has tipped. My life is insufficient. It will take the entire academy, and then the world beyond, until all is still.”

Valerius leaned heavily against a bookcase. The grey in his hair had spread, and a fine network of stone-like cracks marred the skin of his right hand. He held it up, examining it with detached curiosity. “Charm doesn’t work on it,” he said, his voice raspy. “I tried, in the corridor. You can
