  "narrative_voice": "Close third-person, primarily from Lyra's perspective. Richly sensory, focusing on taste, texture, and visceral feeling. The prose is lyrical when describing magic and decay, and taut during moments of tension. It carries a hint of gothic melancholy that gradually lightens.",
  "tone": "Begins with dark academic anxiety and palpable dread, shifts into eerie body-horror (the organic, thorny magic), and culminates in exhausted, hard-won hope. The ending is bittersweet\u2014victory is not a return to normal, but a permanent, beautiful change.",
  "plot_summary": "Lyra Thorne, a student at the elite Arcanum Finis, fails her final magical assessment due to a persistent 'stutter' in her power. This failure triggers the awakening of her family's dormant legacy\u2014a wild, organic magic of sentient thorns and decay that begins to consume the academy. Pursued by Professor Valerius, who sees her magic as a corruption to be purged, Lyra must delve into the truth of her inheritance. She discovers it is not a curse, but a primordial magic of growth and memory, perverted by generations of fear and the academy's own rigid suppression. The climax occurs in the Dreaming Garden, where Valerius's purifying magic clashes with the fully manifested thorn-legacy. Lyra, instead of choosing one side, uses her understanding to weave a third path: accepting the legacy's transformative power but guiding its growth toward life, not ruin. She turns the monstrous thorn-tree into a great oak, symbolizing a new, symbiotic beginning. The petrified victims are freed, the garden blooms anew, and the characters are left changed, facing not an end, but a fundamentally altered world.",
