Chapter 3: Waking Dreams

Ozone and old roses began the dream—the scent arriving first, sharp and electric, undercut by the cloying sweetness of decaying petals. Sunlight flooded the solar, thick with pollen motes dancing in bars of honeyed light. Each particle hung suspended, gilded, as if the room itself breathed gold dust. Vivid details assaulted her: the frayed edge of a pattern under her fingertips, rough as truth, its wool threads worn to a ghost of their original crimson; distant chatter of courtiers in the garden below, a distinct murmur of gossip and laughter, the clink of porcelain, the rustle of silk against stone. This place lived in a hundred illuminated manuscripts: the Royal Solar of the West Wing, Castle Somnus, the day the curse fell.

Her own breath seemed foreign here. The air tasted of sugared almonds and cedarwood, a festive, doomed flavor that coated her tongue.

In the heart of the room, where the light pooled thickest, sat the spinning wheel.

No monstrous, thorn-wreathed thing of legend, but a beautiful construct of pale, almost luminous wood, like birch stripped of its bark and polished by moonlight. Its spindle, a slender shard of polished silver, caught the sun and fractured it into rainbows on the stone floor, scattering prismatic shards over the grey flagstones. Moonlight and spider-silk seemed to spin the wheel itself, its spokes perfectly symmetrical, humming with a latent, musical tension. Before it sat a young woman—Princess Elara, her mind supplied—holding a lock of sun-gold hair between her fingers, twisting it slowly. No fear touched the princess’s face, only a profound, weary curiosity, as if she were contemplating a difficult equation. Faint shadows circled her eyes, delicate blue veins visible at her temples. A gown of cream and cobalt whispered against the stool with every slight shift.

“It’s just a moment,” Elara whispered to the empty air, her voice clear as a crystal bell, yet hollow. “Just one, perfect moment.”

Her finger, pale and slender, the nail trimmed short and neat, hovered over the silver tip. The air in the solar tightened, grew denser. Pressure squeezed Lyra’s dream-lungs in an agony of anticipation.

Lyra tried to scream, to move, but her feet rooted in the dream-stone, a cold seepage of immobility climbing her calves. A ghost in this memory, forced to watch. Elara’s skin met the spindle without blood, without any shock of pain. Instead, a deep, resonant hum filled the solar, a vibration that started in the floor and traveled up through her bones, humming in her teeth. It was like a plucked string the size of the world. Light in the room didn’t dim; it stilled. Dancing motes froze mid-air. Laughter from the garden cut off into an eternal, half-formed echo, the *ha-* of a chuckle never completed.

And the wheel changed.

Beautiful pale wood darkened, bleeding into the grey of dead bark, the grain swelling and distorting like a spreading bruise. The silver spindle tarnished to a sickly, leaden hue, leaching its shine into the air as a metallic mist. From its base, thin, thorned vines of blackened briar began to unspool—not growing, but unfolding as if squeezed into a single point, a terrible origami of decay. They crept across the frozen sunlight toward the princess, now a statue of perfect, breathless repose, a fine layer of dust already settling on the cobalt of her sleeve. Each thorn was a unique, twisted hook, some barbed, others needle-sharp, glistening with a faint, viscous film.

From the princess, her eyes dragged to the heart of the wheel itself. Within the newly formed dark wood, something pulsed. A shadow deeper than the rest, a core of absolute negation. Not an absence, but a presence. Malevolent, watchful, and ancient. This thing had twisted the hum into a silence, corrupted the moment into a prison. Staring, a cold gaze seeped into her dream-self, ice water trickling down her spine. The presence shifted. It noticed her.

A soundless voice, not in her ears but in the marrow of her, formed a single, silt-choked word: *Thorne.*

The frozen scene shattered like dropped glass.
A gasp, sharp enough to hurt her throat, tore Lyra awake. She bolted upright in her narrow dormitory bed, the rough wool blanket tangling around her legs. Grey pre-dawn light from Arcanum Finis seeped through the window, painting the room in shades of ash and chalk, leaching color from the plain wooden desk, the worn rug. Absolute silence broke only against the frantic drum of her own heart against her ribs. Her right hand clutched to her chest, and she forced her fingers to uncurl.

The petrification—once just a small, coin-sized patch of grey, gritty skin on her palm—now crawled like a splash of spilled mortar. It had spread across the heel of her hand, and tendrils, fine as cracks in pottery, reached toward her wrist and the base of her fingers. The skin there felt deadened, cold, and when she pressed a fingertip from her left hand against it, the sensation was muffled, as though through thick cloth. A low, constant ache pulsed within it, a deeper echo of the dream-hum.

Swinging her legs out, her feet met the cold floorboards. The shock of it was grounding. She focused on the grain of the wood, the splintery texture, the solid, unmagical reality. But the dream clung—the taste of almonds and cedar, the frozen quality of the light, the weight of that gaze.

A soft knock at her door made her jump. Before she could answer, it opened a crack, and Kael’s face appeared, his usual sardonic expression softened by the dim light and something else—concern.

“You were making noises,” he said, his voice low. “Not screams. Worse. Like you were trying to shout with no air.”

He slipped inside, closing the door without a sound.wore a simple tunic and trousers, his hair mussed from sleep. He didn’t ask if she was alright. His eyes went straight to her hand, still held before her in the grey light.aight to her hand, which she hadn’t managed to hide.

“Let me see,” he said, not a request.

Reluctantly, she extended her arm. He took her wrist, his fingers warm and calloused against her uninjured skin. He turned her hand over, his thumb brushing near the edge of the grey patch. His touch was clinical, but his jaw tightened.

“It’s spreading faster,” he observed, his voice flat.

“The dream was… clearer. More real.” Lyra found her own voice raspy. “It was the moment of the curse. I saw it happen. And the thing in the wheel… it saw me back.”

Kael released her hand, but didn’t step away. The closeness felt charged in the quiet room. “It’s not just a memory, then. It’s an imprint. And it’s interactive.” He ran a hand through his hair. “Briarwood’s exercises?”

“He has me meditating on family heirlooms. Tracing lineage.” She spat the words, the bitterness fresh. “It feels like he’s trying to build a bridge to the curse, not a wall against it.”

“Maybe he is.” Kael leaned against her desk, crossing his arms. “The orthodox Briarwood method: understand the poison so you can design the antidote. Problem is, you have to swallow a bit of the poison first.”

“It’s not an antidote he’s after,” Lyra whispered, the conviction cold in her gut. “He wants to know how the poison works. For his collection.”

They were silent for a moment, listening to the first distant sounds of Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic. waking—a door closing far down the hall, the faint clang from the kitchens below.

“We need to look at the other side,” Kael said finally. “Not just the curse’s origin, but its opposite. The counter-current. My… research in the lower stacks suggests there were traditions, even here, that worked with wild magic, not against it. Before Grimm’s regime cleaned house.”

“Growth as both beauty and violence,” Lyra murmured, recalling the thorned vines unfolding.

Kael’s eyes gleamed in the half-light. “Exactly. Breaking the form. Maybe your way out isn’t by reinforcing the Thorne legacy, but by breaking its hold.” He pushed off the desk. “Meet me at the library’s east arch after morning rituals. Not the main entrance. The one by the defunct conservatory.”

He left as quietly as he came, leaving Lyra alone with the creeping grey on her skin and the phantom scent of dying roses.

Morning rituals at Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic. were a study in controlled resonance. The Great Hall thrummed with the collective, low chant of several hundred students, a sound that vibrated in the stone floor and pressed against Lyra’s eardrums. The air smelled of incense—dragon’s blood and myrrh—and the faint, ever-present chalk-dust of spent magic. Lyra stood in her assigned row, mouthing the words of the Stabilization Cant, her voice lost in the chorus. Her right hand, tucked into the sleeve of her robe, throbbed.

She watched Professor Briarwood at the lectern. He led the chant with precise, minimal movements, his voice a calm, steady baritone that somehow cut through the mass of sound. He looked the picture of orthodoxy—impeccable, controlled, a master of the established forms. But she saw the intensity in his eyes as they swept over the students, a collector’s appraisal. She wondered what he saw when he looked at her. A failing heir? Or a fascinating specimen?

Headmistress Grimm observed from a high balcony, a silhouette against the leaded glass window, her presence a silent enforcement of the order below.

As the final harmonic faded, leaving a ringing silence, Briarwood’s gaze found Lyra. He gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod before turning away. The summons was clear.

She found him in his study later, not after class, but instead of her scheduled practical session. The room was, as ever, a monument to contained knowledge. The smell of old paper, leather bindings, and the peculiar, dry scent of preserved magical components filled the air. A new item sat on his desk: a small, ornate music box made of the same luminous pale wood as the dream-wheel. It was silent, closed.

“You missed the practical session on Warding Gestures,” Briarwood said without preamble, not looking up from a parchment he was annotating with a silver-nibbed pen. The scratch of the pen was loud in the room.

“You asked to see me, Professor,” Lyra said, standing before the desk, her petrified hand clenched hidden in the folds of her robe.

“I did. Because your theoretical work is advancing, but your practical application is deteriorating. The Warding Gesture requires a fluid, unified flow of intent through the body. Your right side is becoming a dam.” He finally looked up, his grey eyes sharp. “Show me your hand, Lyra.”

The command hung in the air. She hesitated, a rebellion of silence. Then, slowly, she extended her arm, rolling back her sleeve to reveal the creeping grey.

Briarwood did not react with horror or even surprise. He leaned forward, his expression one of pure academic focus. He did not touch her. “Fascinating. The spread is along the minor thaumaturgic pathways. The Lacuna Mortis is not attacking randomly. It is following the map of your own innate magic.” He sat back, steepling his fingers. “Describe the dream again. Every detail. Especially of the presence.”

His clinical tone was a cold bath. He didn’t care about her fear, only her data. The bitterness from earlier curdled into something harder. She gave him a flat, precise report, omitting only the visceral terror, the feeling of the gaze. She mentioned the wheel’ beauty, its corruption, the unfolding thorns.

When she finished, he was silent for a long moment, staring at the music box. “The wheel was not the source,” he mused, almost to himself. “It was the conduit. The catalyst. The presence was already there, waiting in the between-places. The princess’s ‘perfect moment’ of stillness… it was a key turning in a lock.” His eyes snapped back to her. “Your dreams are not mere recollections. You are, through your blood, touching the lock itself. You are providing a continuity the curse recognizes.”

“So I’m making it worse,” Lyra said, her voice tight.

“You are accelerating the process of engagement. Which, for our purposes, is not worse. It is clearer.” He opened a drawer and withdrew a small velvet pouch. From it, he poured a single item onto the desk: a ring. It was a simple band of that same pale wood, set with a tiny, cloudy grey stone. “This was Princess Elara’s. A trifle. A betrothal ring, never given. It carries a resonance of her, from before.”

He pushed it toward her. The wood looked fragile, ancient. The grey stone seemed to swallow the light.

“Your meditation tonight. Focus on this. Not on the curse, but on the woman who existed before the spindle. Trace her lineage in your blood. Not just the moment of fracture, but the life that led to it.”

Lyra stared at the ring. It felt like a trap. A deeper hook. “And if the presence notices me again?”

A faint, almost hungry smile touched Briarwood’s lips. “Then we will learn what it wants with a living Thorne heir. Take it.”

The command brooked no refusal. She picked up the ring. The wood was shockingly warm, almost alive. The grey stone felt like ice against her skin. She pocketed it, the weight negligible yet immense.

“Dismissed,” Briarwood said, already returning to his parchment. “Do not miss another practical session. The rigidity of the form exists to protect you, even if you cannot feel it.”

The east arch of the library was a forgotten place. Ivy choked the stonework, and the door, once leading to a lush conservatory, now opened onto a hollow, glass-domed space filled with the skeletons of dead plants and the smell of damp earth and rot. The glass panels were grimy, letting in a greenish, submarine light.

Kael was waiting, perched on the edge of a dry fountain, a satchel beside him. He had two books tucked under his arm, their bindings cracked and non-descript.

“No one comes here since Grimm had the ‘wild’ specimens removed,” he said by way of greeting. “Too untidy. The perfect place for untidy research.”

Lyra joined him, the silence of the dead conservatory a relief after the charged atmosphere of Briarwood’s study. She told him about the ring, holding it out on her palm. In the greenish light, the cloudy stone seemed to swirl with faint, internal shadows.

Kael whistled softly. “A direct tether. He’s not messing around.” He didn’t touch it. “Be careful with that. It’s not just a link to her. It’s a link to the moment she became a link.”

“He wants me to trace her life. To build the bridge from the other side.”

“Maybe we should,” Kael said, surprising her. He set his books down. “But not the way he wants. He wants a linear path, a pedigree. Life to curse. But magic, real magic, isn’t linear. It’s a web. A pattern.” He opened one of the books. The pages were handwritten, the ink faded, the script a looping, informal style unlike the rigid print of academy texts. Diagrams showed interlocking circles, nodes of power, not straight lines of descent. “These are notes from a groundskeeper, about seventy years back. A hedgewitch tradition, absorbed and then suppressed by Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic.. They worked with the land, with growth cycles. They believed stagnation was the only true corruption. That decay was just part of the pattern, making room for the new.”

He pointed to a passage. “The thorn defends the rose, but the rose must outgrow the thorn, or it becomes a cage. They saw the Briarwood curse not as an anomaly, but as a pattern of rigidity taken to its extreme. A moment of perfect stillness that became permanent.”

Lyra’s mind raced, connecting it to the dream—the frozen light, the stilled motes. “The curse is enforced stillness. No growth, no decay. Just… stop.”

“And your family,” Kael said, closing the book gently, “has been trying to solve it with more stillness. More control. More perfect, rigid forms. Briarwood’s methods. It’s like trying to heal a frostbite by dipping the patient in ice.”

The truth of it resonated in her bones, a clearer hum than the morning chant. “So what’s the alternative? Chaos?”

“Directed violence,” Kael corrected. “A breaking. You can’t gently persuade a stone to become a flower. You need the crack for the seed. Your magic, the wild strain your family fears… it might not be the problem. It might be the only tool sharp enough to break the stone.”

He looked at her petrified hand. “That isn’t just the curse spreading. That’s your body trying to meet the curse with its own language. Stone against stone. Maybe you need to speak a different language entirely.”

The idea was terrifying. It meant rejecting everything Briarwood, everything Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic., everything her own legacy had taught her was safe. It meant embracing the very thing that marked her as flawed.

“How?” The word was a whisper.

“Tonight, with the ring,” Kael said, his voice low and intent. “Don’t follow Briarwood’s meditation. Don’t trace a line. Use the ring as… a focal point, but not a anchor. When you dream, don’t just observe. Remember what you felt when you made the inkwell bloom? That surge of life, messy and sudden? Try to find that feeling. Even if it’s just a spark. The curse is stillness. So be motion.”

It was the opposite of all instruction she’d ever received. It felt like being told to jump off a cliff to learn how to fly.

“And if I get lost?” she asked.
Kael met her gaze, his usual flippancy gone. “Then I’ll be here. In the morning. To hear about it. I can’t follow you into a dream, Lyra. But you’re not as alone as they want you to think.”

He handed her the hedgewitch book. “Hide this. Don’t let Briarwood or Grimm see it. It’s not on any approved list.”

She took it, the leather binding soft and pliant, alive compared to the dead, rigid covers of her academy texts. The weight of the book and the ring in her pocket felt like a counter-balance.

That night, in the silence of her dormitory, Lyra prepared. She placed Elara’s ring on the small table beside her bed. In the moonlight, it looked spectral. She opened the hedgewitch book to a diagram showing a spiral of growth, with thorns on the outside protecting a central, bursting bloom.

She did not assume the formal meditation posture. She lay on her bed, her petrified hand resting on her stomach, and simply looked at the ring. She didn’t try to empty her mind or follow a lineage. She thought of the inkwell, the shocking green of the vine, the rough texture of the leaves against her fingers. She thought of the feeling—not of control, but of release. A channel opening.

She let her mind touch the ring’s resonance, not as a historian, but as a thief of feeling. She didn’t seek Elara’s name or title. She sought the sigh she might have made on a warm afternoon, the ache in her fingers from embroidery, the thrill of a secret glance. The life before the legend.

Sleep took her not as a sudden plunge, but as a slow, deepening drift.

The ozone and roses were fainter this time, blurred at the edges. She was in the solar again, but the light was different—dappled, moving. Elara was there, not at the wheel, but standing by the window, the ring on her finger. She was younger, her face unlined by weary curiosity. She was laughing at something someone below had said, the sound bright and unburdened. The scene had a fragile, watercolor quality.

Lyra, the dream-ghost, felt a pang of profound loss. This was the “before.” This was what the curse had suspended.

She tried to hold the feeling Kael had described—the messy surge of life. She focused on the moving light, the sound of the laugh, the living warmth of the memory. She willed herself not to be a passive observer, but a presence. She reached out, not with a hand, but with an echo of that inkwell feeling, a push of raw, unbidden life toward the watercolor scene.

The dream shivered.

Elara’s head turned, slowly. Not toward the window, but toward Lyra. Her eyes, the same shade as Lyra’s own, met hers. There was no recognition, only a faint puzzlement, as if she’d heard a distant, familiar note of music.

Then, from the corner of the room where the spinning wheel would one day sit, a darkness coagulated. The presence. It was formless here, in this “before” memory, but it was aware. It sensed the intrusion, the foreign pulse of active, growing magic in a memory of peace. It didn’t like it.

The watercolor world began to bleach, the laughter distorting, slowing. The presence was enforcing the stillness, trying to freeze this memory too, to scrub out Lyra’s vibrant touch. Pressure built, the ozone smell sharpening, the roses reeking of sweet decay.

Lyra held her ground in the dream, pouring more of that wild, thorny feeling into her ghost-self. She didn’t attack the darkness. She simply was, vividly, messily alive in the past. A green shoot in a frozen field.

The darkness surged toward her, a wave of silent, chilling negation.

Just before it touched her, Elara, in her memory, looked from the darkness to Lyra. For a split second, her puzzled expression cleared into something else—a flash of fierce, desperate solidarity. She raised her hand, the one wearing the ring, and made a gesture. Not a warding. A beckoning. A breaking of her own perfect moment.

The dream shattered, not into silence, but into a cacophony of sound—ripping fabric, snapping twigs, a single, clear note from a broken string.

Lyra awoke.

She was on the floor beside her bed, having fallen. Her body thrummed with spent energy. Her petrified hand was clenched into a fist. Slowly, she opened it.

The grey skin remained, but at its very center, on her palm, was a new detail. A tiny, pinprick crack. And from that crack, the faintest, almost imperceptible shimmer of something green and vital, like the first hint of moss on a tombstone.

The ring on the table had split cleanly in two, the pale wood sundered, the grey stone dull and inert.

Outside her window, the first true light of dawn was breaking, not in shades of ash, but in streaks of violent, beautiful gold and rose.
