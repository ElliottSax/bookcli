Chapter 4: Fractured Alliance

The second petrification didn’t have the shock of the first. It carried the deeper, colder dread of confirmation.

Lyra heard the commotion from the alchemy lab—a distant, sharp cry swallowed by the sudden silence that followed. That silence was more terrible than any noise. By the time she reached the Grand Library’s mezzanine, a crowd had already congealed like clotting blood around the base of a towering shelf labelled ‘Oneiromancy & Prophetic Aberrations.’

A boy was on his knees, one hand outstretched toward a fallen tome, the other frozen in a clawed gesture of panic. From his fingertips to his shoulder, a livid, greyish-white crystallization had spread, capturing the fine wool of his academy jacket in eternal, stony folds. His face was half-turned, mouth open in a silent shout, eyes wide with a terror that was now a permanent exhibit. The blight had climbed to his jawline. The rest of him was still flesh, still trembling faintly.

“Don’t touch him!” Professor Thorn’s voice, usually a dry rustle, was a whip-crack. “Back, all of you!”

Lyra’s own hidden mark, beneath her sleeve, throbbed in dull sympathy. She recognized the boy. Felix. Quiet, with an unfortunate tendency to grow thick fingernails he’d constantly file away. A descendant of the Beast, they whispered. Now he was becoming a statue in his own right.

As the crowd was herded back, the whispers were less of fear and more of accusation.

“...poking around where he shouldn’t...”

“...their kind of magic is unstable...”

“...like calls to like. The blight knows the tainted.”

Lyra felt the words like physical blows. She took a step back, colliding with someone solid. Valerius. He didn’t move away. His presence at her shoulder was unnervingly still.

“He was researching transformation reversals,” Valerius murmured, his voice for her alone. His eyes weren’t on Felix, but on the faces of the encircling students. “Trying to find a way to suppress his own legacy. A futile endeavour.”

Before Lyra could respond, a voice cut through the murmuring. Cassian, a prefect with the polished demeanour of a politician and the sharp eyes of a hawk. He pointed a finger, not at the petrified Felix, but at Lyra.

“She was in the Restricted Stacks last night. I saw her leaving. And now this? Another one touched by the old curses falls. What was she looking for? What did she do?”

All eyes swivelled to Lyra. The air grew thick, hard to breathe. The library’s dust, usually a comforting scent of aged paper, now choked her. She saw suspicion hardening into certainty on their faces. The Spindle’s heir, the girl who slept for a week at a time, marked by the original sin of enchantment.

“I didn’t—” she began, her voice treacherously thin.

“A coincidence, surely,” Valerius said, stepping forward, his tone glacially calm. He positioned himself slightly between Lyra and the crowd. “Lyra was under my supervision, compiling cross-references on mineral-based hexes for our shared project.”
