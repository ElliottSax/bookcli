Chapter 1: The Legacy of Thorns

Chalk dust in Arcanum Finis tasted of old bones and forgotten spells, a fine powder that coated the back of the throat and lingered like the ghost of every failed incantation ever attempted within these walls. Lyra Thorne tried to focus on the rune she was meant to be inscribing in the air, a simple luminescence charm, but the grit on her tongue was a distraction. Or maybe it was just the taste of her own fear, metallic and sharp beneath the dust. Around her, thirty other final-year students murmured incantations, their hands weaving light into being. The air hummed with clean, competent magic—apple-blossom bright and summer-rain fresh, with undertones of polished oak and clean linen. Lyra’s space stayed stubbornly dark, a pocket of stillness in the shimmering room.

Smooth and cold beneath her palms, her bench of ancient rowan wood was marked by faint grooves where generations of nervous students had dug in their fingernails. Nervous sweat, sharp and human, mixed with the ozone crackle of successful spellwork and the faint, ever-present smell from the stone corridors beyond—damp moss and cold earth from foundations sunk deep into the hill.

“Concentration, Miss Thorne,” Professor Briarwood intoned, her voice like two sheets of parchment rubbing together. A silhouette of severe black wool and disappointed expectation, she stood at Lyra’s shoulder, her shadow falling across the blank parchment, long and consuming. “The proctor from the Grand Collegium is watching. This is your final practical assessment.”

Lyra knew. A pinprick of cold pressure settled between her shoulder blades, as tangible as an ice-tipped needle. From the raised observation gallery at the rear of the hall, the proctor’s dry, assessing stare seemed to measure the empty air around her hands. A shuddering breath drew in the hall’s thick, too-warm air, heavy with sweat and ozone and the cloying perfume of enchanted candles that never dripped wax but still gave off the scent of melted tallow.

Extending her right hand, fingers trembling slightly, she began the somatic form: a spiral from the heart, outward. The wool of her academy tunic scratched against her wrist. A familiar, faint stirring warmed her blood, a warmth uniquely her own, like sunlight filtered through deep water. It began to gather in her palm, a soft, gold-tinged glow that pulsed once, weakly, like a dying firefly.

Then, the stutter. Not a snap, but a sinking. The floor of her own magical core developed a sudden, soft spot, giving way to a cold, airless hollow. The warmth drained away, not violently, but with a sickening, irrevocable seep, as if her very lifeblood were leaking into some unseen fissure. The fledgling light in her palm guttered, choked on nothing, and died with a soundless pop that echoed louder in her skull than any thunderclap. Her hand, still held aloft, was just a hand—pale, dotted with a faint spray of freckles like cinnamon dust, utterly mundane against the shimmering backdrop of her peers’ success.

A snicker cut through the scholarly silence, sharp as a splinter. From the next bench over, Valerius of the Aureate Line stood, his own luminescence charm not merely glowing but sculpted into a perfect, radiant lily that turned slowly above his palm, casting his handsome features in a flattering, saintly light. Petals of light shed motes that smelled faintly of honeysuckle. He didn’t look at her. He didn’t need to. The angle of his chin, the slight, pitying curve of his smile said everything.

*Prince Charming’s get,* Lyra thought with a familiar, acidic resentment that burned the back of her throat. *Of course his magic works like a song. Ours was always more of a scream.*

“Failure,” Professor Briarwood sighed, the word final as a tombstone settling into wet earth. A note scratched onto her wax tablet, the stylus’s *skritch-skritch* obscenely loud, a dry, definitive sound that seemed to carve the judgment into the air itself. “Theory alone cannot carry you, Miss Thorne. Not here. Not with your… particular lineage.” A faint rustle of starched collar accompanied the tilt of her head. “The Spindle’s curse does not excuse a lack of foundational control. It merely makes mastery more… urgent.”

Lyra lowered her hand, letting it fall to her side where it felt heavy and useless. Heat flooded her face, a stark contrast to the cold hollow in her chest. The other stares prickled now, not mocking like Valerius’s, but wary, distant. They were all descendants here, their bloodlines recorded in the gilt-edged ledgers of Arcanum Finis: children of clever tailors and brave youngest sons, of beanstalk climbers and wolf-slayers. Their legacies were stories of triumph, smelling of hearth-smoke and victory. Hers was a footnote of perpetual sleep, a warning woven from thorns that snagged at the edges of every lesson.

Even the lecture hall itself seemed to judge. High, arched windows of leaded glass filtered the afternoon light into long, dusty shafts that illuminated motes of that ever-present chalk. Walls lined with bas-relief carvings of legendary spells, their curves and angles worn smooth by time, now showed the carved faces of long-dead mages looking down with stone-carved disappointment.

From the gallery came the soft, deliberate clearing of a throat. The proctor.

Professor Briarwood moved away, her sensible, low-heeled shoes tapping a quiet, dismissive rhythm on the flagstones. “Proceed to the next sigil, all of you. The ward of containment. Miss Thorne, you may… observe.”

Observe. The word was a soft prison. Lyra clenched her hands at her sides, short nails biting into her palms. The familiar, thorny resentment coiled in her stomach. It wasn’t fair. She knew the forms. She could recite the twelve principles of sympathetic linkage backwards. Her essays were returned with precise, red-ink notes praising her analytical rigor. But here, with her hands in the air and the expectation like a weight on her lungs, nothing happened. Or worse, it stuttered and died. She watched as the others raised their hands again. The air grew thick with new scents: the crisp, green smell of growing vines for the containment ward, the mineral tang of summoned stone. Valerius’s ward shimmered into being not as a simple dome of force, but as an intricate lattice of interlocking golden bands, humming with stable power. He completed the gesture with a graceful flip of his wrist, as if dismissing a servant. Lyra’s own fingers itched to move. She mimicked the somatic form under the cover of her desk, tracing the angles in the dust on the rowan wood. A faint, internal warmth answered, a sleepy glow that promised power. But when she imagined channeling it, pushing it out into the world, she felt that same soft, sucking emptiness, as if her magic were water and her being a sieve. Her legacy was not a torch to carry, but a hole to fall into. The final bell tolled, a deep, bronze sound that vibrated in the stone floor and the fillings of her teeth. The shimmering wards and lights winked out, leaving the hall feeling suddenly drab and exhausted. Students gathered their things—parchment, brass-calibrated compasses, personal focus stones—with the relieved chatter of a trial passed. “Lyra.” Professor Briarwood’s voice stopped her at the heavy oak door. The professor stood by her lectern, tidying already-perfect stacks of parchment. Her office, visible through an open side door, smelled of lemon oil, black tea, and the peculiar, dry scent of preserved moths pinned in cases. “A word.” Lyra approached, the worn soles of her boots whispering on the stone. The last of the other students filed out, their voices fading down the corridor. Valerius paused at the doorway, casting one last, unreadable look back—not quite pity, not quite contempt, but the cool assessment of someone cataloguing a weakness. When the door thudded shut, the silence was immense. Professor Briarwood did not look up immediately. She carefully aligned the corners of a sheaf of papers, the sound like a soft knife stroke. “Headmistress Grimm wishes to see you,” she said finally, her eyes still on her task. “Before supper.” Lyra’s stomach dropped. “The Headmistress? About today?” “About your continued tenure.” Briarwood looked up then. Her eyes were the colour of weak tea, and just as revealing. “The Grand Collegium proctor’s report will be final. Your theoretical scores are exemplary. Your practicals are… non-existent. This creates a dissonance the Collegium cannot accommodate. They deal in measurable results, not academic potential tangled in historical… complications.” The word ‘complications’ hung in the air, smelling of dust and dried roses. It meant the curse. It meant the hundred-year sleep that ended the Thornes’ tale. It meant the spinning wheel and the pricked finger and the kingdom falling quiet, a story that ended not with ‘ever after’ but with a long, blank silence her family had never fully awoken from. “I’m trying,” Lyra said, and hated the thinness of her own voice. “Trying is not a form of magic the Collegium recognizes.” Briarwood’s tone softened, but it was the softness of a shroud. “Go. The Headmistress’s tower. Don’t keep her waiting.” The walk out of Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic. was a journey through a landscape of whispers. The corridors of Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic. were never quiet, but now the sounds felt directed: the click of a door closing just as she passed, the sudden drop in conversation from a group of third-years clutching botany texts, the way a passing servant carrying a basket of laundry averted his eyes. The very stones of the place, steeped in successful magic, seemed to repel her failure. She passed Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic.’s great double doors, oak blackened with age and studded with iron sigils that hummed with protective energy. Within those walls, her family’s ledger lay, its entry brief and brutal. She knew it by heart: Thorne Line. Notable Manifestation: Somnolent Curse (Spindle-based, Class 7 Sympathetic). Status: Dormant. Legacy Rating: Cautionary. Her feet carried her through the Grand Foyer, under the vast, stained-glass window depicting the First Weaving of Light. The coloured light painted the floor in jewel-toned patches—ruby, sapphire, emerald. She walked through a pane of deep violet, and for a moment, she felt a faint, sympathetic vibration in her blood, a whisper of something old and wild. Then she stepped into the yellow light, and it was gone. The tower stair was a spiral of cold, rough-hewn stone, lit by floating witch-light orbs that bobbed gently like luminous jellyfish. Their light was blue and cold, casting long, wavering shadows. The air grew cooler as she climbed, smelling of rain and distant thunder. The Headmistress’s domain. At the top, a simple door of grey wood stood ajar. From within came the smell of lightning-struck ozone, strong black coffee, and, underneath it all, the faint, sweet-rot scent of night-blooming flowers. “Enter, Miss Thorne.” The voice was not loud, but it seemed to come from the stones themselves. Lyra pushed the door open. Headmistress Agatha Grimm’s study was not what one expected. It was not a place of stern portraits and locked bookcases. It was chaos made sacred. Vines with flowers the colour of bruises climbed one stone wall, their petals slowly opening and closing as if breathing. A large, scarred worktable dominated the room, covered in a fascinating catastrophe: copper astrolabes humming with independent rotation, cracked geodes spilling raw crystal teeth, several small, self-contained weather systems swirling in glass domes—one raining tiny diamonds, another shedding ash. Books were stacked not on shelves but in precarious towers on the floor, their spines leather, vellum, and in one case, what looked like polished bark. The Headmistress herself stood by a tall, narrow window that looked out over the mist-shrouded school grounds and the dark line of the Wildwood beyond. She was a tall woman, her hair a wild shock of silver-white, held back from her face by a simple leather thong. She wore robes of deep charcoal grey, but they were stained at the cuffs with earthy green and the faint, iridescent blue of dragonfly wings. She turned, and her eyes were the startling, pale grey of a winter sky moments before snow. “Lyra,” she said, and her voice held none of Briarwood’s dry parchment quality. It was low, textured, like wind through pine boughs. “You stink of chalk dust and despair. Come in. Shut the door. The draft annoys the whispers.” Lyra obeyed, the door closing with a solid thunk that sealed her in this strange, thrumming space. She noticed then the shadows in the room were not still. They pooled and shifted independently of the light sources, sometimes taking on vague, suggestive shapes before melting away. “Professor Briarwood sent me,” Lyra began, her voice formal in the informal room. “Briarwood sends reports. She sends memos. She rarely sends people.” Grimm moved to her worktable, nudging a small, squeaking brass orrery out of her way with a finger. She picked up a simple clay cup, sniffed its contents, and took a sip. “She sent you because the proctor from the Grand Collegium is likely, at this very moment, writing the word ‘unsuitable’ next to your name. And Briarwood, for all her rigidity, understands that ‘unsuitable’ is a death sentence here. A quiet one, but a death nonetheless.” Lyra said nothing. The truth was a cold stone in her gut. Grimm set the cup down. “You cannot do the simple charms. The lights. The wards. The cleansings.” “No.” “But you feel the magic.” “Yes.” The admission was torn from her. “I feel it. It’s… warm. And then it’s gone. Like a door slamming shut inside me.” “A door.” Grimm considered this, her pale eyes sharp. “Or a drain. Tell me, when you attempt the luminescence charm, what do you think of?” “The form. The incantation. Not failing.” “And when you are not trying? When you are angry? Or frightened? Or… lost in a daydream?” Lyra thought of the violet light in the foyer, the vibration. She thought of times alone in the library, feeling a restless energy in her hands with no form to give it. “It… stirs. Sometimes.” “But you push it down.” “It’s not correct. It’s not the form.” Grimm let out a sound that was almost a laugh, but drier. “The form. The Arcanum, and the Grand Collegium behind it, worships at the altar of the Form. The correct gesture, the precise word, the purified intent. It is magic made safe, made predictable. It is a beautifully pruned rose bush.” She gestured to the wild, bruise-coloured vines on her wall. “It produces lovely, identical blooms. It also kills anything that grows in a different shape, labelling it a weed.” She walked around the table, coming closer. Lyra caught the scent of her—ozone, soil, and something fiercely, fundamentally alive. “Your legacy, Lyra Thorne, is not one of precision. It is one of profound sympathy. A pricked finger that echoes into a kingdom’s sleep. That is not a small, tidy magic. It is a wild, deep, and terribly inconvenient one. The forms they teach you are a language your magic does not speak. Trying to force it is like trying to sing a storm into being using only the rules of grammar. You will fail every time.” Lyra’s heart was pounding, but not with fear now. With a terrible, fragile hope. “What do I do?” “You stop trying to speak their language. You listen for your own.” Grimm’s gaze was relentless. “But I must warn you. The path of self-definition, of growing into a legacy that is a curse and a power both… it is not the pruned rose. It is the wild briar. Growth like that is not neat. It is violent. It breaks the old pot to make room for the roots. It tears through the tidy garden walls. The Collegium would see you pruned back into a safe, barren stick. Or removed entirely.” She returned to the window, looking out at the gathering twilight. “There is another way. But it is not sanctioned. It is not safe. And it requires you to embrace the very thing they call your failure.” “What way?” Lyra asked, her voice barely a whisper. Before Grimm could answer, a sharp, triple knock sounded at the tower door, precise and authoritative. The Headmistress’s expression closed like a book. “That will be Kael,” she said, the warmth leaching from her voice, replaced by a formal chill. “He is… an independent tutor of sorts. He deals with problems the Collegium prefers not to acknowledge. He has agreed to assess you.” The door opened without Grimm bidding entry. A man stood framed in the doorway. He was not tall, but he seemed to fill the space, dressed in practical, travel-stained leathers, not robes. His hair was dark, cropped short, and a faint, silvery scar traced from his temple down to his jaw, pulling slightly at the corner of his eye. He looked young, but his eyes were old, a green so dark it was nearly black, and they held no academic curiosity, only a flat, assessing scrutiny. He carried the scent of the world outside: cold air, pine resin, and the faint, iron tang of old blood. “Headmistress,” he said, his voice a low rasp, as if from disuse. His eyes swept the room and landed on Lyra, pinning her in place. “This the Thorne girl?” “Lyra, this is Kael,” Grimm said, her posture now rigid, the wild seer replaced by the administrative head. “He will conduct an… alternative evaluation. Tomorrow, at dawn. At the old watchtower on the northern edge of the grounds. Where the school’s wards fray.” Kael’s gaze never left Lyra’s face. He looked at her not as a student, not as a failure, but as a thing to be understood, or dismantled. “Don’t eat breakfast,” he said, the command stark. “And wear something you can run in.” He gave The hope Grimm had kindled now warred with a sharp, primal fear. This man, Kael, was not a professor. He was something else entirely. “Who is he?” Lyra asked. “A gardener of wild things,” Grimm said softly, returning her gaze to the darkening window. “And sometimes, a reaper of them. Dawn, Lyra. The old watchtower. That is your chance.”

Lyra left the tower as the last of the daylight bled from the sky. The witch-lights in the stairwell seemed dimmer, the distant laughter from the common rooms a hollow echo. She carried two truths within her now, heavy and contradictory: the crushing verdict of the Collegium, and the terrifying possibility Grimm had offered.

As she crossed the shadowy foyer, she deliberately stepped into the pane of deep violet light from the stained glass. This time, she didn’t fight the faint, wild vibration that rose in response. She let it hum in her bones, a silent, discordant note in Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic.’s harmonious song.

It felt like the first, fragile crack in a shell she hadn’t even known was suffocating her.

She was halfway to the dormitory stairs when a cold whisper of air snaked down the corridor. The violet light at her back flickered, and in the darkened glass of a trophy case, she saw not her own reflection, but a fleeting, superimposed image: the stern, disapproving face of the Collegium’s High Proctor, his eyes sharp and knowing, fixed directly on her retreating form. A scrying echo, lingering like a scent.

He had been watching. Not just the tower, but her.

The breath froze in her lungs. The Proctor’s silent gaze in the glass promised no quiet dismissal, only immediate consequence. Dawn at the watchtower was no longer a choice. It was a desperate flight. And Kael, the man who smelled of wilds and old blood, was now her only path through a gate that had just slammed shut behind her.
