Chapter 2: The Clockwork Heart

Morning after the petrification brought a muffled terror. Gone was the Arcanum Finis refectory’s usual cacophony—the clattering cutlery, hissing steam kettles, and overlapping babble of a hundred theoretical arguments—replaced by a low, anxious hum. Listless bars of sunlight, thick with dust motes, fell across the long oak tables, failing to warm the room. Lyra kept her left hand buried in her robe’s pocket, fingers curled into a stiff, secret fist.

The petrification hadn’t spread, but it hadn’t receded either. From her little fingertip to the middle knuckle of her ring finger, her skin matched the colour of weathered marble, cold and unyielding to the touch. A strange, dull ache pulsed there, not a pain of nerves, but a deeper, structural complaint, as if her bones mourned their own flexibility. She’d woken with a start just before dawn, the dream-memory of a spindle’s whirring scream fading from her ears, to find the stone waiting. A pair of fine, black kidskin gloves—pilfered from the lost-and-found bin near the alchemy labs—now hid the evidence. They were tight, the left one straining.

“Lyra.”

The voice was like a smoothed stone itself: cool, solid, devoid of unnecessary warmth. Valerius stood beside her table, a tray in his hands. Impeccably dressed as always, his academy robes bore not a single crease, his dark hair precisely cut. His sharp, analytical grey eyes took in her gloved hands, her untouched toast, the shadows under her eyes.

“Headmistress Grimm requires us,” he said. No greeting, no acknowledgment of the previous day’s horror. “The research team. Now.”

Lyra’s stomach tightened. “Us?”

“A puzzling directive, I agree.” He didn’t sit. “The conservatory. Bring your notes on temporal resonance theory. If you have any that are coherent.”

He was already turning away. Forcing herself to stand, her legs felt unsteady. The conservatory wasn’t a place of plants, but of projects—a vast, glass-domed hall where final-year students and faculty conducted complex, long-form enchantments. That was where it had happened.

Their walk became a gauntlet. Whispers trailed her like cobwebs. *Spindle-kin. Bad luck. Did you see her face when it happened? Like she knew.* She kept her eyes fixed on Valerius’s straight back, using him as a bulwark against the stares. He moved through the crowd with the effortless authority of someone who had never been an object of speculation, only of respect.

Beneath the great central dome, Headmistress Grimm awaited them, a place usually bathed in rainbow light from intricate glass prisms. Today, the prisms were still, the light flat and grey. The Headmistress looked as if carved from the same exhausted stone as the academy’s gargoyles. Beside her stood a tense-looking professor of Thaumaturgical Pathology and two senior students Lyra recognized as top performers in Biological Alchemy.

“Ah. Lyra, Valerius.” Grimm’s voice was a dry
