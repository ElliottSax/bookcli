Chapter 3: Waking Dreams

Ozone and old roses began the dream.

Lyra stood in a sun-drenched solar, the air thick with pollen motes dancing in bars of honeyed light. Vivid, sharp details assaulted her—the frayed edge of a tapestry under her fingertips, rough as truth; the distant chatter of courtiers in the garden below, a distinct murmur of gossip and laughter. This place lived in a hundred illuminated manuscripts: the Royal Solar of the West Wing, Castle Somnus, the day the curse fell.

In the heart of the room, where the light pooled thickest, sat the spinning wheel.

No monstrous, thorn-wreathed thing of legend, but a beautiful construct of pale, almost luminous wood. Its spindle, a slender shard of polished silver, caught the sun and fractured it into rainbows on the stone floor. The wheel itself seemed spun from moonlight and spider-silk. Before it sat a young woman—Princess Elara, her mind supplied—holding a lock of sun-gold hair. No fear touched the princess’s face, only a profound, weary curiosity.

“It’s just a moment,” Elara whispered to the empty air. “Just one, perfect moment.”

Her finger, pale and slender, hovered over the silver tip.

Lyra tried to scream, to move, but her feet rooted in the dream-stone. A ghost in this memory, forced to watch. Elara’s skin met the spindle without blood, without any shock of pain. Instead, a deep, resonant hum filled the solar, like a plucked string the size of the world. Light in the room didn’t dim; it stilled. Dancing motes froze mid-air. Laughter from the garden cut off into an eternal, half-formed echo.

And the wheel changed.

Beautiful pale wood darkened, bleeding into the grey of dead bark. The silver spindle tarnished to a sickly, leaden hue. From its base, thin, thorned vines of blackened briar began to unspool—not growing, but unfolding as if squeezed into a single point. They crept across the frozen sunlight toward the princess, now a statue of perfect, breathless repose.

Lyra’s eyes dragged from the princess to the heart of the wheel itself. Within the newly formed dark wood, something pulsed. A shadow deeper than the rest, a core of absolute negation. Not an absence, but a presence. Malevolent, watchful, and ancient. This thing had twisted the hum into a silence, corrupted the moment into a prison. Staring, a cold gaze seeped into her dream-self. The presence shifted. It noticed her.

The frozen scene shattered.

A gasp, sharp enough to hurt her throat, tore Lyra awake. She bolted upright in her narrow dormitory bed. Grey pre-dawn light from Arcanum Finis seeped through the window, painting the room in shades of ash and chalk. Her right hand clutched to her chest, the petrification—once just a small patch on her palm—now crawled like a splash.
