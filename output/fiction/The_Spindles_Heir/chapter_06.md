Chapter 6: The Midnight Garden

Chapter 6: The Midnight Garden

The silence of the East Dormitory was a living thing. It wasn’t the absence of sound, but a thick, velvety pressure that filled the high-ceilinged corridor, a silence spun from watchfulness and dread. Lyra stood with her ear pressed to the cold oak of her door, not listening for footsteps, but for the space between them.
It was there, now—a faint, rhythmic stutter in the world’s heartbeat. Since the ghost’s visitation, the sensation had grown from a vague unease into a tangible map of time’s flow. She could feel the guards’ patrol patterns not as sound, but as sluggish pulses of attention, like the lazy blink of a great, stone eye. Each blink had a frayed edge, a moment of perceptual lag.
“Now,” she whispered, the word barely a breath.
She opened the door. The corridor was empty, lit by the sickly blue glow of witch-light sconces that appeared to burn slower tonight, their light viscous. Across the hall, Valerius’s door swung open in perfect unison. He moved with a predator’s grace, but his face was pale, jaw tight. Behind him came Elara, her scholar’s robes exchanged for dark, practical wool, her fingers nervously tracing the embossed cover of a small journal. Bringing up the rear was Kaelen, the stocky, silent descendant of a blacksmith line, his hands flexing as if already gripping a weapon he did not have.
They were a conspiracy of the cursed. Lyra, heir to the Spindle’s sleep. Valerius, to the Blade that failed. Elara, to the Sage whose warnings went unheeded. Kaelen, to the Forge that crafted the spindle’s original frame. Their shared inheritance was a stain, and the petrification of two more students that afternoon—found in the library, fingers frozen around a book on geological anomalies—had made them prisoners in all but name. Confinement was meant to keep them safe, or to keep them contained. Lyra no longer knew the difference.
“The lag is… seventeen heartbeats,” Lyra murmured, leading them forward. Her own heart was a frantic drum against her ribs. “Follow my steps exactly. Don’t think about being quiet. Think about being… unfelt.”

They moved like ghosts through Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic.’s arteries. Lyra’s time-sense unfurled before her, a spiderweb of temporal tension. She could see the guard at the end of the West Wing corridor not with her eyes, but as a dense knot of alertness. As his head turn, she focused on the moment, pulling at the frayed edges of the ‘now’, stretching the instant of his inattention like warm taffy.
The world hiccupped.
A faint, metallic taste filled her mouth. The witch-lights dimmed for a fraction of a second, their hum dropping to a groan. The guard’s turn became a slow, disjointed roll. They slipped past him, pressed into the shadow of a marble arch, and the world snapped back with a soft, auditory click. The guard completed his turn, seeing nothing but an empty hall.
“Gods above,” Elara breathed, her eyes wide. “You didn’t just hide us. You stole a piece of time.”

Lyra wiped a trickle of blood from her nose. “It’s not stealing. It’s borrowing. And it wants to be paid back.”

Valerius watched her, his earlier disdain tempered by a grim respect. “Can you do it again?”

“As long as the thorns keep singing,” she said. The song was a constant now, a low, cello-like thrum in her bones, pulling them not toward the outer walls, but deeper into Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic.’s heart, toward the oldest, most forgotten quadrant.
They descended a disused servants’ staircase, the air growing colder and damper with each step. The stone here was rough-hewn, weeping moisture. The thrum became a vibration, then a palpable slowness. The dust motes in their single lantern’s beam hung suspended, reluctant to fall.
“Time is sick here,” Kaelen rumbled, his voice startling in the thick quiet. “It feels… heavy.”

At the bottom of the stairs was a door, not of oak, but of blackened iron, streaked with rust like old blood. It was unmarked, barred from their side by a beam so thick it took both Valerius and Kaelen to lift it. The groan of shifting metal was swallowed by the dense air.
Beyond was not another cellar, but night.
A walled garden, hidden in a courtyard so interior no window from the main buildings overlooked it. The academy’s high, blind walls rose on all sides, a prison of stone under a sliver of cold moon. And the garden… the garden was a nightmare of perverse beauty.
It was overgrown, but not with roses or ivy. Metallic vines, the colour of tarnished silver and bruised iron, coiled over every surface. They were barbed with thorns as long as Lyra’s finger, needle-sharp and glinting dully. The vines pulsed. Not with light, but with a slow, rhythmic contraction, like the veins of a sleeping leviathan. With each pulse, the very air thickened. Lyra’s next breath was an effort, drawn through syrup. Sound died. Her own heartbeat became a distant, laboured thud.
“The locus,” Elara whispered, and the words took an age to leave her lips, hanging visible in the air as puffs of frost.
At the garden’s center, where paths of cracked white gravel converged, stood the tree. Or what had been a tree. It was petrified, not into stone, but into something darker—obsidian, shot through with veins of sickly gold. Its trunk split into two twisted arms, from which skeletal branches curved and spiraled in a horrifyingly familiar shape. It was a colossal, organic spinning wheel. One branch formed the drive wheel, another the distaff, and a sharp, protruding spike served as the spindle. Around its base, the metallic vines were densest, knotted into a grotesque root system thato burrow into the earth itself.
“It’s growing,” Lyra said, her voice flat with horror. “The original spindle. It’s been here all along, sleeping. And it’s waking up.”

Valerius stepped forward, his boots crunching on the gravel with absurd, elongated slowness. “This is the source of the blight. The ‘still magic.’ It’s not a curse laid upon the land. It’s a… a seepage.”

“A wound,” Kaelen corrected, kneeling. He pointed to the ground where the vines emerged. The earth was not soil, but a grey, granular powder, devoid of life. “A festering wound in the world. My ancestor’s forge-fire made the metal. Your ancestor’s magic,” he looked at Lyra, “made it fatal. Together, they made this.”

The thrumming rose to a deafening crescendo inside Lyra’s skull. The pulse of the vines quickened. And the shadows at the edges of the gardeto move.
They detached themselves from the larger coils, taking form. They were crude, spindly things, woven from thorny tendrils, moving with a jagged, stop-motion animation. Some skittered like giant, barbed insects. Others lurched upright on two legs, their upper limbs ending in wicked, piercing points. They had no faces, only a malevolent, directed intent that Lyra as a cold spot in her temporal sense.
“Thorn-wights,” Valerius hissed, his sword already in his hand. The blade, usually alive with a faint, heroic shimmer, was dull. The magic here stifled it. “Defend the center! Don’t let them corner you!”

The fight was a grotesque ballet in slow motion. Lyra’s perceptions were split: the frantic, adrenaline-fueled rush of her own body, and the molasses-slow movement of everything else. Valerius’s sword strokes were powerful but ponderous. Kaelen wielded the lifted iron bar from the door, his swings devastating but achingly slow. A thorn-wight lunged at Elara, who stood frozen, journal clutched to her chest. Lyra shoved her aside, feeling a thorn graze her sleeve. It sliced through the wool like it was parchment.
She had no weapon. Only her curse.
Another creature, a scuttling horror of clicking barbs, launched itself at Valerius’s flank. He was engaged with two others, his movements faltering in the gelid time. It would pierce his back.
No.
Lyra didn’t think. She reached out—not with her hands, but with that new, raw sense at her core. She didn’t try to stretch time. She grabbed the moment of the creature’s leap and squeezed.
The world didn’t hiccup. It stopped.
Sound vanished. The slow-motion struggle of her friends froze into a tableau. The leaping thorn-wight hung in the air, a foot from Valerius’s side, utterly motionless. Not slowed. Still. Lyra’s breath caught. She had done this. She had imposed absolute stillness, a tiny, localized replica of the Spindle’s sleep.
The cost was immediate and violent. A white-hot pain lanced from her temples through her entire nervous system. She tasted copper, felt a warm flood from her nose and ears. Her knees buckled. The held moment shuddered, a crack forming in her will.
“Lyra!” Valerius’s shout was muffled, far away.
The stillness broke. But the thorn-wight did not resume its attack. It fell to the gravel with a dry rattle, its animating magic extinguished. It was just a tangle of inert, metallic vines.
The other creatures recoiled, as if sensing the same power that had created them had simply been used to unmake one of their own.
Valerius used their hesitation. With a roar that seemed to tself from the sluggish air, he surged forward, his sword finally finding a fraction of its speed. He cleaved through two wights, their forms dissolving into dust and rust. Kaelen smashed a third. The remaining few retreated, melting back into the larger, pulsing mass of vines.
Silence rushed back in, heavier than before.
Lyra was on her hands and knees, blood dripping from her face onto the grey earth, each drop falling with the solemn, slow finality of a funeral bell. The garden swam around her. The pulse of the great spindle-tree was inside her now, a second, slower heartbeat syncing with her own.
“You saved my life,” Valerius replied, kneeling beside her. There was no triumph in his voice, only a stark awe.
“It’s… what I am,” she gasped, the words raw.
Elara was at her side, pressing a cloth to her nose. “The total stasis… it’s theoretically impossible without catastrophic recoil. Your body shouldn’t be able to channel that.”

“Tell that… to my head.”

Valerius stood, turning back to the petrified tree, his face set in lines of grim determination. “This is it. The source. We burn it. Now.” He began gathering dry, dead tendrils from the periphery, building a pyre against the obsidian trunk.
“Wait,” Lyra croaked, but the protest was weak. Exhaustion was a weight on her soul. Maybe he was right. Purge it with fire.
As Valerius bent to place a final bundle of thorns, a vine, dormant and hidden in the grey dust, twitched. It was a reflexive, dying spasm. A single, needle-like thorn scored a line across the back of his right hand, just above the gauntlet.
He jerked back with a curse, dropping the thorns. It was a shallow scratch, barely bleeding. He shook his hand, scowling. “Damn things.”

Then he froze.
They all saw it. The scratch didn’t well with red. It turned grey. The colour leached from his skin, spreading from the thin line outwards, a stain of ash and stone. Not petrification—not yet—but a terrible, creeping numbness. Valerius stared at his hand, his eyes wide with a fear Lyra had never thought to see in him. He flexed his fingers. They moved, but stiffly, as if the joints were filling with sand.
He raised his other hand, summoning the faint, golden glow of his heroic magic, a simple light to examine the wound. The light sputtered over his palm, weak and guttering. As it passed over the greyed skin, it died entirely, snuffed out like a candle in a tomb.
The Blade’s magic, the legacy of the hero who had tried to cut the Spindle down, faltered and failed before the Spindle’s own blight.
Valerius looked from his deadened hand to Lyra, his face a mask of dawning horror. The invincible scion, the warrior, had been touched by the same curse that plagued the dreamer. He was vulnerable. He was one of them.
From the base of the petrified spindle-tree, a new sound emerged—a deep, subterranean crack, like ice splitting over a dark lake. A fissure opened in the grey earth, and from it, a single, perfect shoot of tarnished silver emerged, unfurling a glossy, metallic leaf toward the cold slice of moon.
The garden was no merely st awake.
It was growing.
