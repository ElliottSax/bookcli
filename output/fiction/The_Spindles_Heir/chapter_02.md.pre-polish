Chapter 2: The Clockwork Heart

The morning after the petrification was a study in muffled terror. The usual cacophony of the Arcanum Finis refectory—clattering cutlery, the hiss of steam kettles, the overlapping babble of a hundred theoretical arguments—had sunk to a low, anxious hum. Sunlight, thick with motes of dust, fell in listless bars across the long oak tables, failing to warm the room. Lyra kept her left hand buried in the pocket of her robe, fingers curled into a stiff, secret fist.

The petrification hadn't spread, but it hadn't receded either. From the tip of her little finger to the middle knuckle of her ring finger, her skin was the colour of weathered marble, cold and unyielding to the touch. A strange, dull ache pulsed there, not a pain of nerves, but a deeper, structural complaint, as if her bones mourned their own flexibility. She’d woken with a start just before dawn, the dream-memory of a spindle’s whirring scream fading from her ears, to find the stone waiting for her. A pair of fine, black kidskin gloves—pilfered from the lost-and-found bin near the alchemy labs—now hid the evidence. They were tight, the left one straining.

“Lyra.”

The voice was like a smoothed stone itself: cool, solid, devoid of unnecessary warmth. Valerius stood beside her table, a tray in his hands. He was impeccably dressed, as always, his academy robes bearing not a single crease, his dark hair precisely cut. His eyes, a sharp, analytical grey, took in her gloved hands, her untouched toast, the shadows under her eyes.

“Headmistress Grimm requires us,” he said. No greeting, no acknowledgment of the previous day’s horror. “The research team. Now.”

Lyra’s stomach tightened. “Us?”

“A puzzling directive, I agree.” He didn’t sit. “The conservatory. Bring your notes on temporal resonance theory. If you have any that are coherent.”

He was already turning away. Lyra forced herself to stand, her legs unsteady. The conservatory wasn’t a place of plants, but of projects—a vast, glass-domed hall where final-year students and faculty conducted complex, long-form enchantments. That was where it had happened.

The walk was a gauntlet. Whispers trailed her like cobwebs. Spindle-kin. Bad luck. Did you see her face when it happened? Like she knew. She kept her eyes fixed on Valerius’s straight back, using him as a bulwark against the stares. He moved through the crowd with the effortless authority of someone who had never been an object of speculation, only of respect.

Headmistress Grimm awaited them beneath the great central dome, a place usually bathed in rainbow light from intricate glass prisms. Today, the prisms were still, the light flat and grey. The Headmistress looked as if she had been carved from the same exhausted stone as the academy’s gargoyles. Beside her stood a tense-looking professor of Thaumaturgical Pathology and two senior students Lyra recognized as top performers in Biological Alchemy.

“Ah. Lyra, Valerius.” Grimm’s voice was a dry
