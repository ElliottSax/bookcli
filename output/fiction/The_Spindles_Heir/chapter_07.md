Chapter 7: The Unhero's Choice

Chapter 7: The Unhero’s Choice

The air in the hidden garden was not still, but it was silent. A terrible, swallowing quiet, broken only by the wet, ragged sound of Valerius’s breathing. He sat propped against the moss-eaten plinth of a sundial, its bronze face long since verdigrised into a blind green eye. The thorn, a sliver of polished darkness, still protruded from the meat of his left palm. Around it, the skin had taken on a waxy, greyish cast, like tallow left too long in the cold.
Lyra knelt before him, her own hands hovering, not daring to touch. The others—Kaelen, the sharp-eyed descendant of a shadow-walker, and Elara, whose blood once sang to metal—stood sentinel a few paces back, their faces etched with a shared, helpless dread. They had found the source: a twisted, blackened spindle-tree growing from the heart of a ruined folly, its branches weeping those same thorns. But the discovery hollow, a prize that crumbled to ash in the winning.
“It’s not pain,” Valerius said, his voice a parody of its usual melodic resonance. It was flat, stripped of the unconscious, honeyed persuasion that was his birthright. “It’s an… absence. A numbness climbing up the vein.” He tried to flex his fingers, and the movement was stiff, a puppet’s gesture. A faint, despairing laugh escaped him. “My great-grandfather could charm a king into giving up his crown with a handshake. I can’t even make my own fingers curl.”

Lyra saw it then, the true corrosion. It wasn’t just the physical petrification. The magic in his blood, the lineage of charm and allure that had defined his house for centuries, was being unspun. His legacy was turning from a mantle into a cage, and he was watching the bars solidify around him.
“We need to understand it before we can fight it,” Lyra said, more to herself than to him. The ghost of her ancestor, the Weeping Countess, had whispered of ‘seeing the weave, not the thread.’ Lyra had spent a lifetime fearing the deep, waking sleep of her curse—that absolute stillness where time stretched and frayed. Now, she had to court it.
“Kaelen, Elara—don’t let anything touch us. Not a leaf, not a breath of wind if you can help it.”

Elara nodded, her hand going to the iron nails at her belt, their latent magnetism a weak but present magic. Kaelen simply blurred at the edges, his form drinking the scant light, becoming a watchful patch of deeper shadow.
Lyra settled onto the damp, cold earth, crossing her legs. She took Valerius’s wounded hand in hers. His skin was cool. She met his eyes, the famous gold now dimmed, flecked with microscopic veins of grey.
“I’m going to look,” she replied.
“Into the thorn?”

“Into what the thorn does.”

She closed her eyes, not to block out the world, but to seek the other sight. The time-sense was a fragile, skittish thing, like trying to study a raging river by catching single droplets. She had always used it in flashes, in terrified glimpses. Now, she had to submerge.
She began by slowing her own breath, drawing it in until her lungs burned, letting it out until her body hollow. She focused on the point of contact—his palm against hers. She ignored the scent of loam and decay, the distant drip of moisture, the electric fear of her friends. One by one, she shut the doors of her senses.
The world didn’t go dark. It went quiet. Not the quiet of the garden, but the profound silence at the bottom of a well. Her own heartbeat became a distant, sluggish gong.
Then, she pushed her time-sense toward the thorn.
It was like pressing her face against a pane of glass smeared with oil and soot. At first, confusion—a chaotic swirl of impressions. The thorn’s own history: the slow, patient poison of the blighted garden seeping into its growth over decades. Valerius’s blood, bright and hot and active, a luminous, golden thread teeming with inherited purpose. The moment of puncture, a violent collision.
She pushed deeper, past the event, into the aftermath.
And she saw it.
The magic of the thorn was not a simple toxin. It was a pattern, a replicating, hungry algorithm. It moved through Valerius’s bloodstream not like a poison, but like a virus, seeking out the clusters of active magical signature—the very essence of his lineage’s charm. It didn’t destroy them. It inverted them. It turned the outward-pushing, influencing energy in on itself, folding it, compressing it, making it still. Each spark of magical identity it touched became a tiny, frozen node. A seed of petrification.
A cold, academic clarity detached itself within Lyra’s trance-state. This was too precise to be mere decay. This was design. The original curse, the one that had felled her ancestor and created the Spindle’s Heir… what if it had been intended as a shield? A brutal, overarching vaccine meant to suppress all magical bloodlines, to render them inert and safe from some greater threat? Or a weapon, turned inward by accident or treachery, that had crippled its makers?
The theory was a ghostly scaffold in her mind. It didn’t matter now. The ‘how’ was only a path to the ‘how to stop it.’

She traced the pattern backwards, along the thorn’s essence, seeking a weakness, a counter-frequency. But the pattern was complete, a closed loop. It offered no end. To undo it would require an equal and opposite force—not more magic, but an unmaking of magical action. A paradox.
Her consciousness, stretched thin across this non-time, fray. She immense gravitational pull of her own curse, the true Stillness that waited for her at the end of all her bloodline’s roads. It was always there, a patient abyss. To find an answer for Valerius, she would have to look into it. Not just use her time-sense, but enter the waking sleep fully, voluntarily.
It was the thing she had spent her life fearing. The final surrender.
In the void of her trance, she made the choice. She let go of the thread of Valerius’s infection, stopped fighting the pull, and turned inward.
And fell.
It was not like sleeping. It was like ceasing to be. Time lost all meaning, direction, and texture. There was no Lyra, no garden, no curse. There was only a vast, hungry presence.
The Stillness.
It was not empty. It was anti. It was the echo after the last sound, the shape left after the sculpture has been ground to dust. It had a sentience, but one incomprehensible to a mind that lived in action and sequence. It was a cosmic appetite, and what it fed on was happening. On change. On magic, the most vibrant change of all.
Lyra’s consciousness, a tiny, flickering candle of ‘was’ and ‘is’ and ‘might be,’ was an affront to it. And a delicacy. She its attention like the pressure of deep ocean trenches, a weight that would obliterate her identity. It did not hate her. It did not know her. It simply, inevitably, sought to consume the active process of her being.
This was the true enemy. Not a sorcerer, not a spell gone wrong. This was the entropy behind the curse, given a terrible, passive will. The spindle-thorns were not the disease; they were the needles, injecting a fragment of this Stillness into the living world. The petrification was the Stillness feeding, slowly converting action into non-action, life into monument.
In that moment of horrific understanding, a sliver of knowledge, cold and sharp, embedded itself in her. She saw how the Stillness spread through Valerius—along the channels of his active magic. To slow it, one would have to dampen those channels. To make him less himself. To still his own magic before the invading Stillness could consume it.
It was a stopgap. A tragic, cruel mitigation.
The attention of the Stillness focused more fully upon her flickering candle-flame. Ito drink her. She her memories, her fears, her love for her friends, being leeched of their vitality, turned into static, fossilized things. She was becoming a portrait of herself, painted in ash.
With a scream that had no sound in that place, she wrenched herself away. She clawed backwards along the thread of her own consciousness, fleeing the absolute, seeking the messy, painful, beautiful noise of being.
She gasped, a raw, shuddering inhalation that scraped her throat. The world crashed in—the smell of damp, the chill of the ground, the sound of a sob.
“Lyra!” It was Elara’s voice, thick with tears.
Lyra’s body was locked, muscles screaming in protest. She was drenched in a cold sweat. Slowly, painfully, she unlocked her fingers from around Valerius’s hand. She looked up.
Kaelen had recoiled, his shadow-form solidifying into a pale, horrified face. Elara stared, a hand clamped over her mouth.
Valerius, his breathing still laboured, looked at her. His expression shifted from concern to a deep, unnameable shock. “Lyra… your eyes.”

She knew. She could feel it. A dry, cool weight on the surface of her eyes, a slight grit against her lids when she blinked. The final stage of her family’s curse, the visible petrification, had begun. Not in her sleep, but now. Awake.
“What did you see?” Valerius asked, his voice a whisper.
Lyra tried to speak. Her voice was a rusted hinge. “It’s… alive. The curse. It’s a hunger. It eats… what we are.” She turned her head, her new vision feeling oddly clear yet distant, as if she were looking through a thin veil of quartz. “I know how to slow it. In you.”

“How?”

She glanced at his hand, the greyness now past his wrist. “Your magic. Your charm. It’s the path it follows. The more you use it, the more you are it, the faster it will take you.” The words were acid on her tongue. “You have to… still it yourself. Deliberately. Suppress your lineage. Become less of a Valerius.”

He stared at her, comprehension dawning with a profound horror worse than any physical pain. To save his life, he had to dismantle his identity. The unhero’s choice: not to die a hero, but to live as a ghost of himself.
A bitter smile touched his lips. “So. The prison becomes the sanctuary.”

“It will buy us time,” Lyra said, the weight of her own stone-tinged eyes a constant reminder of the cost. “It won’t stop it. Nothing can stop it. Only… maybe… redirect it.” The ghost of the Weeping Countess’s words echoed: ‘The heir does not bear the curse to suffer it, but to understand it.’ Understanding, Lyra realized, was a form of agony.
She raised her own hands before her face. They trembled, but they still moved, still felt. For now. She had stared into the heart of the Stillness and returned. She had paid a price, and gained a sliver of terrible power. She knew the enemy’s nature.
Valerius closed his eyes, a slow, deliberate act. When he opened them, the last vestiges of persuasive gold were gone, buried under a film of resigned grey. He withdrew his hand from Lyra’s, placing it carefully in his lap. The flamboyant, magnetic posture he’d always carried was gone, replaced by a simple, weary stillness. It was a conscious, heartbreaking act of self-erasure.
“Then we begin,” answeredaid, and his voice was utterly, devastatingly ordinary.
Elara finally lowered her hand from her mouth. “What now? We can’t stay here.”

Lyra stood, her joints protesting. She looked toward the blighted spindle-tree in the centre of the folly, its thorns glistening with a liquid blackness. The source. But not the cause. The cause was a void that hungered. And she, with her stone-heavy eyes, had become its mirror in the world of light.
“Now,” Lyra said, her voice gaining a new, grim solidity, “we stop looking for a cure in the past. We need to find who, or what, is trying to open the door to that… hunger. And we need to find what the original curse-bearers knew that we don’t.” Shegazedd at her companions, her gaze steady. “The answers aren’t in this garden. They’re in the one place Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic. has sealed shut since the beginning.”

Kaelen’s shadowy form rippled with understanding. “The Founder’s Vault. The original spindle is there.”

Lyra nodded. The hook was set, not in curiosity, but in desperation. To fight a sentient Stillness, they would need to wake something older, and perhaps far more dangerous, from its long, enchanted sleep.
