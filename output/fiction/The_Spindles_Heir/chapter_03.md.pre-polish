Chapter 3: Waking Dreams

The dream didn’t start with darkness, but with the smell of ozone and old roses.

Lyra stood in a sun-drenched solar, the air thick with pollen motes dancing in bars of honeyed light. It was too vivid, too sharp—the frayed edge of a tapestry under her fingertips felt rough as truth, the distant chatter of courtiers in the garden below was a distinct murmur of gossip and laughter. She knew this place from a hundred illuminated manuscripts: the Royal Solar of the West Wing, Castle Somnus, the day the curse fell.

In the heart of the room, where the light pooled thickest, sat the spinning wheel.

It wasn’t the monstrous, thorn-wreathed thing of legend. It was beautiful. Made from pale, almost luminous wood, its spindle was a slender shard of polished silver that caught the sun and fractured it into rainbows on the stone floor. The wheel itself seemed spun from moonlight and spider-silk. A young woman—Princess Elara, her mind supplied—sat before it, a lock of sun-gold hair in her hand. Her face showed no fear, only a profound, weary curiosity.

“It’s just a moment,” Elara whispered, not to Lyra, but to the empty air. “Just one, perfect moment.”

She reached out. Her finger, pale and slender, hovered over the silver tip.

Lyra tried to scream, to move, but her feet were rooted in the dream-stone. She was a ghost in this memory, forced to watch. As Elara’s skin met the spindle, there was no blood, no shock of pain. Instead, a sound filled the solar—a deep, resonant hum, like a plucked string the size of the world. The light in the room didn’t dim; it stilled. The dancing motes froze mid-air. The laughter from the garden cut off into an eternal, half-formed echo.

And the wheel changed.

The beautiful pale wood darkened, bleeding into the grey of dead bark. The silver spindle tarnished to a sickly, leaden hue. From its base, thin, thorned vines of blackened briar began to unspool, not growing, but unfolding as if they had always been there, squeezed into a single point. They crept across the frozen sunlight, towards the princess, who was now a statue of perfect, breathless repose.

But Lyra’s eyes were dragged from the princess to the heart of the wheel itself. Within the newly formed dark wood, something pulsed. A shadow deeper than the rest, a core of absolute negation. It wasn’t an absence. It was a presence. Malevolent, watchful, and ancient. It was the thing that had twisted the hum into a silence, that had corrupted the moment into a prison. As she stared, feeling its cold gaze seep into her dream-self, the presence shifted. It noticed her.

The frozen scene shattered.

Lyra woke with a gasp so sharp it hurt her throat, bolting upright in her narrow dormitory bed. The grey pre-dawn light of Arcanum Finis seeped through her window, painting the room in shades of ash and chalk. She clutched her right hand to her chest. The petrification, once just a small patch on her palm, now crawled like a splash.
