Chapter 2: The Clockwork Heart

Morning after the petrification brought a muffled terror. Gone was the Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic. The refectory’s usual cacophony—the clattering cutlery, hissing steam kettles, and overlapping babble of a hundred theoretical arguments—had been replaced by a low, anxious hum that tasted of burnt coffee and cold porridge. Listless bars of sunlight, thick with dust motes like suspended ash, fell across the long oak tables, failing to warm the room. Yesterday’s mutton stew had seeped into the wood, a greasy, lingering ghost of a normal day. Lyra kept her left hand buried in her robe’s pocket, fingers curled into a stiff, secret fist. The wool scratched against her knuckles, a rough counterpoint to the alien smoothness beneath.

The petrification hadn’t spread, but it hadn’t receded either. From her little fingertip to the middle knuckle of her ring finger, her skin matched the colour of weathered marble, cold and unyielding to the touch. A strange, dull ache pulsed there, not a pain of nerves, but a deeper, structural complaint, as if her bones mourned their own flexibility. She’d woken with a start just before dawn, the dream-memory of a spindle’s whirring scream fading from her ears, to find the stone waiting. It felt less like a part of her and more like something she was carrying. A pair of fine, black kidskin gloves—pilfered from the lost-and-found bin near the alchemy labs, smelling faintly of sulfur and someone else’s lavender water—now hid the evidence. They were tight, the left one straining across the petrified knuckles, the leather whispering a taut protest with every minute movement.

“Lyra.”

The voice was like a smoothed stone itself: cool, solid, devoid of unnecessary warmth. Valerius stood beside her table, a tray in his hands bearing a single, precise cup of black tea. Impeccably dressed as always, his academy robes bore not a single crease, his dark hair precisely cut against his scalp. His sharp, analytical grey eyes took in her gloved hands, her untouched toast congealing in its own fat, the lavender shadows under her eyes that spoke of a night spent staring at the canopy of her bed.

“Headmistress Grimm requires us,” he said. No greeting, no acknowledgment of the previous day’s horror. His words were clean, clipped, leaving no room for the messy questions hanging in the air. “The research team. Now.”

A cold lump formed beneath Lyra’s ribs. “Us?” The word came out thin, stripped of its usual defiance. She must look a dishevelled problem to him, her family’s chaotic legacy written in the panic she couldn’t quite keep from her face.

“A puzzling directive, I agree.” He didn’t sit. He never lingered. “The conservatory. Bring your notes on temporal resonance theory.” A pause, his gaze flicking to her empty hands. “If you have any that are coherent.”

Already turning away, his robe swung with a military crispness. Forcing herself to stand, her legs felt unsteady, as if the floorboards had softened overnight. The conservatory wasn’t a place of plants, but of projects—a vast, glass-domed hall where final-year students and faculty conducted complex, long-form enchantments. That was where it had happened. The air there would still smell of ozone and shattered quartz.

Their walk became a gauntlet.

Through Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic., usually echoing with shouted incantations, whispers trailed her like cobwebs. Spindle-kin. Bad luck. The words weren't always clear, but their meaning was—in every sudden silence that parted before her, in every sideways glance that felt like a touch.

Did you see her face? Like she knew.

Her reflection stared back from a darkened classroom window: a pale, sharp face, hair escaping its braid, the black gloves grotesquely formal. She fixed her eyes on Valerius’s straight back, using him as a bulwark.

He moved with effortless authority. His path cleared not from fear, but from ingrained deference. He was a Briarwood. His legacy was a shield.

Hers was a target.

Past the open doors of the practical casting hall, the sharp, green scent of charged moss and the metallic tang of focused will spilled into the corridor. Inside, students practiced levitation charms on blocks of granite, their faces tight with concentration. A normal morning. The sheer normality of it was a slap. Lyra looked away, her petrified fingers throbbing with a fresh, dull insistence.

Beneath the great central dome of the conservatory, Headmistress Grimm awaited them, a place usually bathed in shifting rainbow light from intricate glass prisms. Today, the prisms were still, the light flat and grey, leaching the colour from everything. The vast space smelled of damp soil, cold glass, and beneath it, the acrid, ghostly after-scent of a massive magical backfire. The Headmistress looked as if carved from the same exhausted stone as Arcanum Finis: The premier magical academy, a labyrinth of gothic stone, chalk-dusted lecture halls, and hidden gardens. A place of strict tradition and latent, thorny magic.’s gargoyles, her usual severe vitality replaced by a deep, weathered fatigue. Her knuckles, resting on the head of her obsidian walking stick, were white.

Beside her stood a tense-looking Professor Halvern of Thaumaturgical Pathology, a small man with a perpetually startled expression, wringing his hands on a stained leather apron. Flanking him were two senior students Lyra recognized as top performers in Biological Alchemy: Elara, whose blonde hair was bound in a ruthlessly tight bun, and Jaxon, his arms crossed over his chest, already looking bored. Their presence was a statement. This was no longer just an incident; it was a subject of study.

“Ah. Lyra, Valerius.” Grimm’s voice was a dry rustle, like pages turning in a tomb. Her eyes, the colour of flint, settled on Lyra, and for a moment, they were not the eyes of a headmistress but of an old woman seeing a ghost she’d hoped was buried. The look was gone in an instant, replaced by grim administration. “We are convening the initial inquiry. You were both witnesses to the… event. Your perspectives, however limited, may contain data.”

Professor Halvern cleared his throat, a nervous sound. “Yes, indeed. Data. The petrification of living tissue via temporal resonance collapse is, well, unprecedented in modern annals. The subject—Professor Finch—is stable, but the condition is perfectly static. No magical decay, no cellular degradation. It’s as if his timeline has been… snipped and sealed at that moment.”

“He is not a ‘subject,’ Halvern,” Grimm said, her tone allowing no argument. “He is a colleague. And he is currently occupying my best stabilisation plinth in the infirmary, which is why we are here, at the locus.”

Lyra’s gaze was drawn past them, to the centre of the conservatory floor. A circle of the finest white marble was scorched black, its intricate guiding runes now blurred and fused as if by tremendous heat. But there was no ash, no debris. It was a perfect, negative space. In the very centre, resting on the blackened stone, was a single, mundane object: the brass calibration spindle from Finch’s chronomancy apparatus. It should have been vaporised. Instead, it lay there, gleaming dully under the grey light, perfectly intact. The sight of it made Lyra’s gloved hand clench, the stone parts grinding with a minute, internal vibration only she could feel.

“You,” Grimm said, and Lyra realized the headmistress was speaking directly to her. “You were closest to Finch when the resonance wave manifested. Describe it. Not the theory. The sensation.”

All eyes turned to her. Valerius’s were analytical, waiting to dissect her response. Halvern’s were hungry for the abnormal. The students’ were merely curious. Lyra’s mouth was dry. She could taste the dust and ozone.

“It wasn’t a sound first,” she began, her voice unfamiliar to her own ears. “It was a… a pressure. In the teeth. At the back of the eyes. Like the air was becoming thicker than water.” She forced herself to look at the spindle. “Then the whine. Not a machine sound. A living sound. A scream pulled thin. Everything in the circle started to… smear. The tools, Finch’s robes, his own hand on the dial. Colours bled into each other like wet ink. And then it just… snapped. Into perfect, horrible stillness.”

“And the wavefront?” Valerius asked, his first contribution. He had taken out a small, silver-bound notebook. “You were struck by the peripheral energy. What was the tactile nature of the discharge?”

He was asking about the moment the grey light had brushed her hand. The moment of cold that had burrowed into bone. Lyra instinctively tucked her left hand behind her back. “Cold,” she said shortly. “Sharp. Not like ice. Like… being touched by something that had never been alive.”

Professor Halvern scribbled furiously. “Fascinating. A thanatological signature within a temporal event! The spindle-kin association may not be merely superstitious, but a folk-memory of a metaphysical resonance—”

“Professor,” Grimm cut in, her voice like a slate cracking. “Confine your speculation to your private notes. Miss Thorne’s family history is not a relevant variable in this analysis.” But the way she said it, the deliberate, heavy emphasis, made it clear it was the most relevant variable of all. She was building a wall, and Lyra was on the other side of it.

“The spindle,” Valerius said, stepping past Lyra towards the scorched circle. He moved with a cautious precision, not entering the blackened area but circling its edge. He didn’t ask permission; his authority was innate. “It survived the temporal collapse. It should be the epicentre of entropy, yet it is pristine. A paradox.”

“Or an anchor,” Lyra heard herself say. The words came from a place of instinct, a deep, unwelcome knowing that felt like remembering. “In spindle divination, you don’t read the thread’s break. You read the tension before it. The point of greatest strain.” She regretted it immediately. Mentioning her family’s art here, in this temple of rigid orthodoxy, was like bringing a rotten flower into a surgical theatre.

Halvern stared, his interest now uncomfortably personal. Jaxon snorted softly. Elara’s lips pursed in distaste.

Valerius, however, stopped his circling. He looked from the spindle to Lyra, his grey eyes calculating. “You propose the artifact is not a remnant, but a cause? That it held the strain of the temporal paradox until it… released?”

“I’m not proposing anything,” Lyra muttered, heat rising to her cheeks. “It’s just a thought.”

“A chaotic one,” Grimm stated, her walking stick tapping once on the floor. A final verdict. “We deal in evidence, not folk poetry. Valerius, you will lead the material analysis of the spindle. Use the Briarwood spectral resonators. I want its every magical history laid bare. Halvern, you and your students will continue monitoring Finch. Document every non-change. Look for patterns in the stasis, however minute.”

She turned her flint gaze back to Lyra. The dismissal was coming. Lyra could feel it, a cold weight settling in her gut. She would be shut out, told to return to her basic studies, to forget what she’d seen and what was happening to her own hand.

“Miss Thorne,” Grimm said. “You will assist Valerius.”

A beat of stunned silence. Lyra saw Valerius’s head tilt a fraction, the only sign of his surprise. Halvern looked affronted.

“Headmistress,” Valerius began, his tone perfectly neutral, “given the sensitive nature of the artifact and the required precision—”

“Your point is noted, Valerius,” Grimm interrupted, her voice leaving no room for debate. “You require an observer with a… unique perceptual sensitivity. The residual energy touched her. That connection, however unfortunate, is a datum. She will log your procedures, handle non-essential materials, and provide a continuous narrative account of the spindle’s condition. You will keep her focused on empirical observation.” Her meaning was clear: Lyra was to be a living sensor, but her thoughts were to be filtered through Briarwood rigor. Her wild magic was to be caged and used.

Lyra felt a confusing storm of emotions: a surge of grim vindication, followed by a wave of nausea. She was being let into the investigation only because she was already contaminated by it. She was both tool and specimen.

“Understood,” Valerius said, closing his notebook with a soft click. He didn’t look at Lyra.

“Good,” Grimm said, her energy seeming to drain away again, leaving only the weary stone. “Begin today. Report any anomaly, no matter how trivial. Dismissed.”

The group dispersed, Halvern shepherding his students away, already whispering about cellular timelines. Grimm turned and walked slowly towards the conservatory doors, her footsteps echoing in the vast, wounded space.

Valerius finally looked at Lyra. “My laboratory is in the West Tower. Be there in one hour. Bring your notes, and whatever passes for your focus.” He glanced at her gloved hands. “And do not touch anything unless I instruct you to. The integrity of the analysis is paramount.”

He left her then, standing alone at the edge of the blackened circle. The grey light from the dome made the world seem two-dimensional. Slowly, against every screaming instinct, Lyra knelt. She didn’t cross into the scorched area, but she leaned forward, peering at the spindle. Up close, she could see the fine, machined grooves along its shaft, designed to hold temporal threads in perfect alignment. Now, they held nothing. They were just empty lines.

A faint, almost imperceptible hum seemed to emanate from it. Or perhaps it was just the blood rushing in her ears. Her petrified fingers gave a sudden, sharp throb, a sympathetic pang that stole her breath. It was a call and an answer. A connection.

She stood up quickly, her heart pounding a ragged rhythm against her ribs. She wasn’t just a witness or an assistant. She was caught in the same snare that had taken Professor Finch. The conservatory, with its cold glass and silent prisms, felt less like a room and more like the inside of a clock that had stopped at the worst possible moment. And she was a gear that no longer fit, grinding itself to dust against the immovable machinery of a legacy she never asked for.

Turning, she walked away from the spindle, each step an effort. The journey back through the corridors was a blur of stone and whispered judgment. But now, the fear was different. It wasn’t just the fear of being seen. It was the fear of what she might be becoming, and the terrifying, thorny knowledge that to find a way out, she might have to understand the very thing that was claiming her.
