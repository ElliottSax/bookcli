earing louder, the gears grinding like teeth in a skull. Elias Crowe’s breath came faster, his chest tight. He needed air. He needed out.
He turned to leave, but something caught his eye—a glint of metal near the base of the central column. He crouched, his flashlight beam revealing a small, brass key. It was old, tarnished, but not as old as the Stillwater Clock Tower (central landmark). He picked it up, turning it over in his gloved fingers. It was cold, heavy, and wrong in his hand. He pocketed it, his mind racing. Who had left it? And why?
As he stood, the sound of the gears appeared to grow louder, more insistent. The air in the chamber was thick, heavy, and the scent of old oil and metal was overpowering. He could feel the weight of the Stillwater Clock Tower (central landmark) pressing down on him, the walls closing in. He needed to get out, to escape the claustrophobic confines of the chamber.
He turned to leave, but the door was gone. In its place was a solid wall of brick and mortar. His heart raced, his breath coming in short, sharp gasps. He was trapped.
He turned back to the chamber, his eyes scanning the walls, the gears, the weights. There had to be a way out. He had to find it.
The ticking of the clock grew louder, the sound of the gears grinding like bones in a mill. He could feel the weight of the Stillwater Clock Tower (central landmark) pressing down on him, the walls closing in. He was trapped.
