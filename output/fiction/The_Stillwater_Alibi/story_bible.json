  "plot_summary": "Detective Elias Crowe is called to the isolated town of Stillwater to investigate the murder of archivist Eleanor Thorne in the local clock tower. What seems a straightforward case quickly unravels as he encounters a wall of polite resistance and a ready-made suspect. Crowe discovers Thorne was researching an old tragedy involving Flora Byrne, a secret the town has collectively buried. His investigation reveals that Thorne's murder was a desperate act to protect this secret, orchestrated by the community's tacit approval. Although Crowe uncovers the real killer, the town, led by Sheriff Lowell, consolidates around a false narrative, allowing the true culprit to go free and framing a scapegoat to achieve a 'legal' closure. The climax occurs as the frozen clock tower bell finally tolls midnight, a somber ritual marking the town's choice to re-seal its past. Crowe departs, having technically solved the crime but understanding a deeper, more unsettling truth: in Stillwater, justice is subordinate to preservation, and some doors are meant to remain locked.",
