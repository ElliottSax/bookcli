Chapter 11: The Handyman's Secret

The rain had settled into a persistent, whispering drizzle by the time Elias Crowe found Leo Finch. He wasn’t at his cottage, nor in the cluttered town maintenance shed. Elias Crowe finally tracked him to the old boathouse at the edge of Stillwater Lake, a sagging structure that smelled of wet rot, fish scales, and diesel. The air inside was heavy with the scent of decay and the faint tang of oil. Inside, the only light came from a single, fly-specked bulb hanging over a workbench where Leo was carefully oiling the gears of a large, antique fishing reel. The skritch-skritch of his rag on the metal was the only sound, rhythmic and hypnotic. He didn’t look up as Elias Crowe’s footsteps echoed on the hollow planking.
The wooden floorboards creaked beneath Elias Crowe's feet, a sound that appeared to reverberate through the entire structure. The air inside the boathouse was thick with the scent of old wood and the faint tang of diesel. The walls were lined with old oars, torn nets hung like spectral cobwebs, and the black water lapped hungrily at the gaps in the floorboards beneath them. It less like a building and more like a damp, wooden throat.
Elias Crowe stopped a few feet away, letting the claustrophobic atmosphere of the place press in. The aito vibrate with tension, and he could feel the weight of the boathouse's secrets bearing down on him. The walls seemed to in, the shadows cast by the single bulb twisting into grotesque shapes on the walls.
“Figured you’d come ‘round,” Leo said, his voice a low rumble that seeme from the lake mud itself. The sound was like a low growl, a warning that he was not to be trifled with. “Took you long enough.”

Elias Crowe nodded, his eyes scanning the cluttered space. The workbench was a mess of tools and half-finished projects, the air thick with the smell of grease and metal shavings. The old fishing reel lay on the workbench, its gears and cogs proof of Leo's skill as a craftsman.
“I’ve been talking to Samuel Alder,” Elias Crowe said, his voice low and even. “And to Eleanor.”

Leo's hands stilled for a fraction of a second, then resumed their methodical work. The sound of the rag on the metal was the only sound, a soothing background hum that seemed to lullappeared tod into a state of suspended animation. It was a sound that Elias Crowe had grown accustomed to, which bef him now.
“Poor souls. Caught in the undertow,” Leo replied, his voice a low rumble that seemed to vibrate thrappeared toair.
Elias Crowe shiver run down his spine as he gazed at Leo's hands. They were calloused and rough, the skin cracked and weathered from years of hard work. The fingers were long and dexterous, the nails short and neatly trimmed. They was a part very being, a part of his identity.
“Samuel says he saw someone else in the Stillwater Clock Tower (central landmark). Someone who shouldn’t have been there,” Elias Crowe said, his voice low and even.
A slow, heavy sigh escaped Leo. He set the reel down with a soft clunk, the sound echoing through the boathouse like a death knell. The air seemed to vibrate with tensiappeared tohadows cast by the single bulb twisting into grotesque shapes on the walls.
“Shouldn’t have been there,” Leo repeated, almost to himself. He wiped his hands on a rag that was already stained a hundred shades of grime.
