Chapter 4: Beneath the Still Water

Chapter 4: Beneath the Still Water

The Stillwater Public Library was a mausoleum for words. It occupied the old Vance family home, a Victorian monstrosity of gingerbread trim and sagging porches that seemed to exhale a breath of chilled, paper-scented air as Elias Crowe pushed open the heavy oak door. The silence inside was not peaceful; it was watchful. Dust motes, illuminated by weak shafts of light struggling through grimy stained glass, swirled like agitated spirits. The air tasted of mildew and forgotten things.

Eleanor Vance sat behind a vast, scarred reference desk, a fortress of piled books and ledgers. Her wheelchair was positioned like a throne. She did not look up as Crowe’s footsteps echoed on the creaking floorboards, her attention fixed on mending the spine of a leather-bound volume with a surgeon’s precision. Her hands, pale and veined, worked with a calm, terrible economy.

“Detective Crowe,” she said, her voice a dry rustle of pages. “I wondered when you’d leave the scene of the crime for the scene of the history.”

“It often seems to be the same place, in my experience,” Crowe replied, removing his hat. The claustrophobia of the town was seeping into him, a physical pressure. The clock tower’s locked-room puzzle was one thing; this collective alibi, this wall of unified silence, was another. It felt less like a lie and more like a ritual.

“You’ll find no history of murder here,” Eleanor said, finally looking up. Her eyes were the colour of the slate roofs outside, and just as hard. “Only accounts of births, deaths, and the slow decay of things.”

“I’m interested in Silas Thorne’s history. Specifically, his history here. Before he was a developer. When he was just a Stillwater boy.”

A flicker in those slate-grey eyes. Something submerged, breaking the surface for a second before vanishing. She laid down her bone folder. “That is a closed book, Detective. And not one we care to re-open.”

“A man is dead. The book is open whether you like it or not.” He leaned on the desk, the old wood groaning. “People talk, Ms. Vance. In whispers. They say he left under a cloud. They say he came back to rub your noses in his success. They say it was personal.”

Eleanor’s laugh was a short, sharp exhalation. “Personal. Yes. Everything in Stillwater is personal. That’s the poison and the point of it.” She wheeled herself out from behind the desk, moving with a grim grace toward a bank of filing cabinets that looked as old as the town. “You want to know why we hated him? It wasn’t the condos. It wasn’t the money. It was the theft.”

“Theft?”

“Of futures. Of trust.” She yanked open a drawer with more force than necessary. The screech of metal was a violation of the library’s silence. She pulled out a slender, unlabeled folder and slapped it onto a reading table. “He was engaged to be married. To my sister, Clara.”

The name hung in the dusty air. Crowe opened the folder. Inside were not official documents, but fragments of a life: a pressed wildflower, brittle and brown; a programme for a high school play, Our Town; a few newspaper clippings. One was a society announcement of the engagement between Silas Thorne, son of Arthur and Mary Thorne, and Clara Vance, daughter of the late Harold Vance. They looked heartbreakingly young. Clara had Eleanor’s strong bone structure but softened by a luminous, open smile. Thorne’s arm was around her, his own face alight with a pride that hadn’t yet curdled into arrogance.

“She drowned,” Eleanor said, the words flat and final. “Two months before the wedding. In Stillwater Lake. They found her boat adrift. She was a strong swimmer. The lake… it is deceptively calm.”

Crowe heard the unspoken accusation in the pause. “And Thorne?”

“Was in Petersboro, arranging business for their new life. Or so he said. The inquest called it a tragic accident. The town… reached a different verdict.” She traced the faded image of her sister’s face. “He left a week after the funeral. Sold his family’s derelict land—swamp and misery—for a pittance to old man Pritchard and vanished. We heard nothing for twenty-five years. Then he returned, not as a penitent, but as a prince. Buying up everything, especially the land around the lake. The land where she died.”

The pieces were beginning to align, but into a shape more ominous than a simple crime of passion. “There are other rumors,” Crowe pressed. “About land. A swindle, long ago.”

Eleanor’s mouth tightened into a seam. “The Thorne family was always poor as church mice. Silas’s father, Arthur, was a dreamer. He and a few others—the Millers, the Carters—pooled what little they had based on a survey Silas produced, claiming the boggy land west of the lake was ripe for development if they just drained it. They invested everything. The survey was a fraud. The land was worthless, perpetually flooded. Arthur Thorne shot himself in shame. The others lost their farms, their homes. Silas took the little money his father hadn’t lost and left town with Clara’s heart in his pocket and blood on his hands.”

“And the others involved? The Millers? The Carters?”

“Gone. Died broken or moved away. All but one.” She wheeled closer, her voice dropping. “Samuel Miller. He was sweet on Clara, too, before Silas dazzled her. His family lost their orchard in the swindle. After Clara died… something in him broke. He lives out at the old Miller place, what’s left of it. He’s the groundskeeper for the clock tower and the town cemetery. He tends the dead.”

A suitor, bankrupted and heartbroken. Crowe filed the name away: Samuel Miller. “Where would I find him?”

“Where he always is. Amongst the stones.” She took the folder back, cradling it. “The bonfire alibi is true, Detective. We were all there. We are always all there, on the solstice. It is a tradition. We burn the old year’s regrets.” She looked at him, and for the first time, he saw a crack in her armour, a deep, weary grief. “Some of us have more to burn than others.”

The Stillwater Cemetery lay on a rise overlooking the lake, the water a sheet of dull lead under the gathering afternoon gloom. The air here was different—colder, smelling of wet earth and decaying flowers. The headstones leaned like rotten teeth. Crowe found Samuel Miller kneeling before a simple granite marker: Clara Vance. Beloved Sister. Taken Too Soon.

He was a man in his late fifties, but he moved with the stiffness of someone older. His clothes were worn but clean, his hands—resting on his knees—were broad and scarred, the nails packed with dark soil. He didn’t turn as Crowe approached.

“Mr. Miller?”

“I know who you are,” the man said, his voice a low rumble from the earth itself. “The city detective. Come to stir the mud.”

“I’m investigating the death of Silas Thorne.”

At the name, Samuel’s shoulders tensed. He patted the grass in front of Clara’s stone, a gentle, intimate gesture. “The lake gives, and the lake takes,” he murmured. Then he stood, turning slowly. His face was a landscape of weathered skin and deep-set, sorrowful eyes. There was no anger in them, only a profound, settled exhaustion. “He shouldn’t have come back. The past doesn’t bury deep here. It waits just under the surface.”

“You knew him. You knew Clara.”

“Knew them?” A faint, tragic smile touched his lips. “I loved them both, in different ways. Silas was a force of nature. Charming, brilliant, hungry. He could make you believe in anything. Even that swamp was a gold mine.” He looked out toward the lake. “He didn’t set out to ruin my father, I think. Not at first. The greed… it grew in him, like a fungus. By the time he had that survey drawn up, he’d convinced himself it was true. And when it all fell apart… he had an escape route. Clara.”

“And when she died?”

Samuel’s eyes glistened. “The light went out of the world. For everyone. For him, too, I suppose, in whatever way a man like him could feel it. He just… turned his back on the darkness here and walked into another life.”

“You’ve been the groundskeeper here a long time. You have access to the clock tower.”

The man’s gaze sharpened, the sorrow momentarily edged with a flinty intelligence. “I have a key to the maintenance shed. Not to the tower itself. Eleanor… Ms. Vance holds the only key to that door. As you well know.” He stated it plainly, a fact, not a challenge. “I was at the bonfire, Detective. We all were. You’ll wear yourself out trying to prove otherwise.”

“Why does everyone keep telling me that?”

“Because it’s the truth. And because,” he sighed, picking up his rusted weeding trowel, “in a place like this, the truth is often the most dangerous thing of all. Now, if you’ll excuse me. The dead don’t tend themselves.”

Frustration was a cold stone in Crowe’s gut. The mutual alibi was a perfect, unassailable wall. The motives were a tangled, decades-old thicket of love, loss, and financial ruin. He needed something concrete, something from Thorne himself.

He returned to the mobile home crime scene, now silent and eerily still. The forensic team had taken the body, but the ghost of violence remained—the dark stain on the floor, the scent of copper under the pine disinfectant. He began a more meticulous search, ignoring the obvious, looking for the hidden.

Thorne was a planner, a researcher. He didn’t just buy land; he would have studied it, known its history. Crowe ran his hands along the underside of drawers, tapped walls for hollow spaces, lifted the edge of the thin industrial carpet.

In the bedroom, beneath a loose floorboard under the bed—a classic hiding place made invisible by the bulky frame—he found it. A slim, fireproof lockbox. It wasn’t locked.

Inside were no stacks of cash, no jewels. Only a sheaf of photocopied documents and a single, faded photograph.

The documents were brittle, yellowed pages of town records: property deeds, tax assessments, surveyor’s maps from the 1940s. They related not to the lakefront land Thorne had been openly purchasing, but to a parcel deep in the woods north of town, land currently owned by the Stillwater Historical Trust. The deeds showed a convoluted chain of ownership, with several lots apparently consolidated into one in 1947 by a company called “North Star Holdings.” The name meant nothing to Crowe. Scribbled in Thorne’s aggressive handwriting in the margins were notes: “Water table?”, “Check foundation permits ‘48-’49”, and, most intriguingly, “Vance holdout?”

But it was the photograph that stole the breath from his lungs.

It was a group shot, taken at the base of the Stillwater Clock Tower. Five young people, arms slung around each other’s shoulders, smiling into a sun that seemed forgotten by time. He recognized a young, vibrant Silas Thorne, his grin wide and untroubled. Next to him, glowing with joy, was Clara Vance. On her other side was a young Eleanor, her smile more restrained but present. Beside her was Samuel Miller, looking at the camera with a shy hopefulness. And on the far end, a young man with a strong jaw and laughing eyes.

But this fifth face was gone. Not torn, not faded. Deliberately, meticulously scratched out with what looked like a knife or a nail, the gouges so deep they had ripped through the paper, leaving a ragged, angry hole where a person should have been.

Crowe turned the photo over. In faded blue ink, in a flowing, feminine hand, was written: Summer’s End, ‘78. The Last Good Day. And below that, a list of names: Silas, Clara, Ellie, Sam, and J.

J.

The hook was no longer a question of who in the town had killed Silas Thorne. It was a question of who, in this photographed circle of friends, had been erased so completely that even their memory was a wound. And what secret, buried deeper than Clara’s body, deeper than the Thorne family shame, was hidden in those 1940s property deeds that Silas Thorne had died trying to uncover?

The fifth face, obliterated. J.

Stillwater’s past wasn’t just whispering. It was screaming from the bottom of the lake. And as Crowe stared at the ruined photograph, he knew with a chilling certainty that the killer hadn’t just murdered a man. They had been defending a secret so old and so dark it had its own foundations, laid down in the town’s rotten bedrock long before any of them were born.
