Chapter 2: A Town of Witnesses

The rain began as Elias Crowe left the clock tower, a fine, persistent mist that seemed to rise from the river stones as much as fall from the sky. It coated Stillwater in a slick, grey film, blurring the sharp edges of the gabled roofs and turning the windows of the shops along River Street into milky, sightless eyes. The air smelled of wet wool, woodsmoke from yesterday’s fires, and something else—a damp, mineral scent of deep earth and old water. It was a smell that got into your clothes, your lungs. Claustrophobic, even out in the open.

Crowe’s first stop was the mayor’s office, a cramped room above the post office that smelled of lemon polish and anxiety. Mayor Alistair Briggs was a man built like a fireplug, with a florid face and hands that seemed too large for the delicate porcelain teacup he was clutching. He didn’t meet Crowe’s eyes, instead staring fixedly at a framed map of Stillwater on the wall.

“A tragedy, Detective. A terrible tragedy,” Briggs intoned, his voice a practiced, somber baritone. “Silas Thorne was a… a force of change. Not always appreciated, but a force nonetheless.”

“Where were you last night, Mayor Briggs? Between eight and ten?”

The mayor’s gaze flickered to Crowe, then back to the map. “Where was everyone? At the solstice bonfire. Out at the old quarry meadow. It’s a town tradition, Detective. Has been since my grandfather’s day. The one night Stillwater truly comes together.”

He described it with a rehearsed warmth: the stacking of the pyre weeks in advance, the procession at dusk, the lighting of the flame as the last sliver of sun vanished behind the pines. Children toasting marshmallows, elders sharing stories, the whole town reflected in the flickering orange light.

“You see, no one could have done this,” Briggs said, finally looking at Crowe, his eyes earnest, pleading. “We were all together. Every soul in Stillwater. Ask anyone.”

Crowe did. He walked the length of River Street, the mist beading on his worn trench coat. At Stillwater Provisions, the grocer, a woman with kind eyes and flour-dusted arms, told him the same story while weighing out coffee beans. “Oh, the bonfire was lovely. Leo Finch got the blaze going higher than ever. We were all there, dear. All of us.” At the damp-smelling bookshop, the elderly proprietor, peering over spectacles, echoed it. “A communal vigil, Detective. A reaffirmation of our bonds against the long dark. No one would miss it.”

The uniformity was absolute, seamless. Each account dovetailed with the next, not just in the broad strokes, but in the details—the height of the flames, the song old Mr. Henderson played on his fiddle, the moment when a shower of sparks had spiraled up into the black like inverted stars. It was a script. A beautiful, haunting, airtight script.

His notebook filled with names, all appended with the same three words: At the bonfire.

The most detailed account came from Beatrice Cole. She lived in a gingerbread-trimmed cottage at the edge of the woods, overflowing with books and the dry, papery scent of pressed flowers. She was Stillwater’s self-appointed historian, a woman in her seventies with a spine as straight as a ruler and eyes the colour of flint.

“Detective Crowe,” she said, ushering him into a parlour crowded with artifacts under glass. A rusted logging saw, a collection of clay pipes, a tattered regimental flag. “You’re investigating the unpleasantness at the clock tower. I suppose you’ve heard about our alibi.”

“It’s come up, yes.”

“It’s not an ‘alibi,’” she corrected, settling into a wingback chair. “It’s a fact. The Summer Solstice Bonfire is the spine of our year. It’s… sacred. Pagan roots, of course, long since baptized into community spirit. To miss it is to declare yourself an outsider. Or a ghost.” She sipped her tea. “Silas Thorne was a ghost long before he died. He hadn’t attended in years. Considered it ‘provincial pageantry.’”

“So he was alone at the clock tower.”

“While the rest of us were bound together in light and warmth,” she said, her voice softening into a genuine, mournful note. “There’s a poetry to it, however grim. The one man who rejected our community, alone in the dark, while the community thrived without him.”

“And you can vouch for everyone? The entire town?”

Beatrice Cole’s flinty eyes held his. “I saw Mayor Briggs stirring the mulled cider with his wife. I saw Leo Finch, our handyman, tending the fire’s edges. I saw Eleanor Vance, of course, in her wheelchair near the warmth, young Tommy Vale from the pharmacy seeing to her. I saw shopkeepers, teachers, children. All present. All accounted for. It was, Detective, a perfect circle. And a perfect circle has no breaks.”

Crowe left her house feeling the walls of the town close in further. The mist was thickening into a drizzle. He found Leo Finch in a cluttered workshop behind the old livery, the air thick with the scent of sawdust and linseed oil. Finch was a man of few words, his hands—scarred, strong, perpetually stained with grease or paint—doing most of the talking. He was repairing a rocking chair.

“Bonfire,” he grunted, in response to Crowe’s question, not looking up from his work. “Started it. Maintained it. Doused it. Took me an hour after everyone left to make sure the embers were dead.”

“You see everyone there?”

“Saw enough.” He planed a piece of wood with a long, whispering shush. “Whole town’s a fishbowl. You’re always seen.”

“Even by a woman in a wheelchair?”

Finch’s plane halted for a second. Then the shushing resumed. “Especially by her. Center of things, she was. Always is.”

The conversation was like trying to grasp smoke. Crowe’s frustration grew with each identical interview. His mind, however, began to work around the edges of this perfect communal alibi. A circle, as Beatrice Cole said, has no breaks. But what if the circle itself was the crime?

**

As the afternoon bleared into a damp, early twilight, Crowe found a stool at the dim end of The Leaky Bucket, the town’s only pub. The place was quiet, the air stale with yesterday’s beer and today’s silence. He replayed the statements in his head, and as he did, the memory of their descriptions conjured the bonfire itself in his mind—not as a fact, but as a vision, vivid and unsettling.

Flashback.

The quarry meadow was a bowl of shadow, the high, jagged walls of cut granite looming black against a indigo sky. At its heart, the pyre was a monstrous beehive of old timber, pallets, and deadfall. As the last light faded, a hush fell over the hundred-odd souls gathered in a wide ring. Mayor Briggs, his face solemn, took a torch from Leo Finch. He didn’t speak. He simply thrust it into the heart of the structure.

The fire did not catch tentatively. It erupted. With a sound like a great intake of breath, flames roared up the tinder-dry skeleton, exploding into the twilight. The crowd gasped as one—a single, communal exhalation of awe and release. The heat was immense, a physical wall that pushed people back a step, their faces instantly gilded, their shadows becoming long, frantic giants that danced up the quarry walls.

Children squealed, not in fear, but in primal delight. The firelight transformed familiar faces into masks of light and hollow shadow. Mayor Briggs, smiling, looked saturnine. Beatrice Cole, watching with sharp, unblinking eyes, seemed carved from ancient wood. Leo Finch moved like a spirit at the periphery, using a long pole to shepherd the collapsing, spitting logs.

And there, in the place of honour closest to the warmth but out of the spark-shot chaos, sat Eleanor Vance. A tartan blanket was tucked around her legs. The firelight glinted off the metal rims of her wheelchair and shone in her gentle, watchful eyes. People brought her cups of cider, stopped to chat, knelt beside her. She was the still, accepting center of the whirling, fiery ritual. She saw everyone. Everyone saw her.

The fiddle sawed a reel, feet stamped, laughter rose and was swallowed by the crackling roar of the fire. It was beautiful. It was pagan. It was utterly binding. For those two hours, Stillwater was not a collection of individuals, but a single organism, breathing in the smoke, breathing out the song, its shared light holding back the vast, pressing dark of the woods. To look away from that flame, to slip away into the surrounding night, would feel like a kind of self-annihilation. An impossibility.

End Flashback.

Crowe shook the vision off, taking a long pull of his bitter ale. The alibi was perfect because it wasn’t fabricated. It was lived. It was a truth so powerful it could conceal another, darker truth within its brilliant, blinding light. He was pondering this, the weight of the entire town’s collective gaze feeling like a physical pressure on his shoulders, when the pub door opened, letting in a gust of wet, cold air.

A young deputy from the county sheriff’s office stood there, his plastic-covered hat dripping. He spotted Crowe and hurried over, holding out a sealed manila envelope.

“For you, Detective. Coroner’s initial report and the evidence log from the scene.”

Crowe took it, a cold knot tightening in his gut. He thanked the deputy and waited until the boy left before sliding his thumb under the flap. The documents inside were crisp, clinical, an intrusion of sterile modernity into Stillwater’s damp, living past.

The cause of death was straightforward: a single, deep stab wound to the heart, delivered with considerable force. Time of death estimated between 8:30 and 9:30 PM. Silas Thorne had put up no fight; there were no defensive wounds, no signs of a struggle. He had been taken by surprise, or had known his killer.

Crowe’s eyes scanned down the inventory of personal effects, the description of clothing, the minutiae of death. Then he reached the section on the murder weapon. It had not been found at the scene. The wound geometry suggested a narrow, triangular blade, approximately seven inches long, with a sharp point and a single cutting edge. The killer had taken it with them.

Attached was a supplemental note from the coroner, a meticulous man. He had consulted with a historian friend on the unique wound characteristics. His professional opinion, based on the clean, deep puncture and the slight tearing at the entry point from a decorative guard, was that the weapon was likely an antique letter opener, of a style popular in the late Victorian era. Specifically, one with a blade of polished Sheffield steel, a sterling silver guard fashioned in the shape of a coiled serpent, and a handle of hematite.

Crowe’s blood turned to ice. He had seen that description before. Not an hour ago.

He fumbled in his pocket for his notebook, flipping past the pages of identical statements. There, in the meticulous notes from his visit to Beatrice Cole’s cluttered cottage. Among the artifacts under glass, she had pointed out a few prized pieces: a locket belonging to the town’s founding mother, a silver spoon from the long-gone hotel… and a matched set of Victorian writing desk implements, donated by the Vance family. “The letter opener is particularly fine,” she’d said. “A serpent guard. Quite rare.”

Crowe’s eyes snapped back to the report. The coroner had appended one final, devastating line, a line that shattered the perfect, circular alibi and plunged the mystery into a deeper, darker well.

Item of Note: The Stillwater Historical Society records indicate a letter opener matching this exact description was part of their permanent collection. It was reported missing two days ago.*
