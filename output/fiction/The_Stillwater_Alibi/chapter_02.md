## Chapter 2: A Town of Witnesses

A fine, persistent mist began as Elias Crowe left the Stillwater Clock Tower, seeming to rise from the river stones as much as fall from the sky. It coated the town in a slick, grey film, blurring the sharp edges of the gabled roofs and turning the windows along River Street into milky, sightless eyes. Cobblestones gleamed like the backs of wet seals beneath his feet. The air thickened with the smell of wet wool, yesterday’s woodsmoke, and something else—a damp, mineral scent of deep earth and old water, the very breath of the river and the quarry. It got into your clothes, your lungs, a taste at the back of the throat. Claustrophobic, even out in the open. A town wrapped in a shroud, every soul within it part of the weave.

His first stop was the mayor’s office, a cramped room above the post office that reeked of lemon polish and underlying anxiety, like a headmaster’s study before a caning. Built like a fireplug with a florid face mapped with tiny broken capillaries, Mayor Alistair Briggs clutched a delicate porcelain teacup in hands too large for it. His knuckles were white. A fixed stare at a framed map of Stillwater on the wall—a chart of old family plots and forgotten footpaths—avoided Elias’s eyes.

“A tragedy, Detective. A terrible, *wasteful* tragedy,” Briggs intoned, his voice a practiced, somber baritone reserved for business closures or lost pets. “Silas Thorne was a… a force of change. Not always appreciated, but a force nonetheless. A man of vision, however abrasive.”

“Where were you last night, Mayor Briggs? Between eight and ten?” Elias’s own voice remained flat, a dull blade probing.

The mayor’s gaze flickered to him, a flash of something—irritation? fear?—before skittering back to the safety of the map. “Where was everyone? At the solstice bonfire. Out at the old quarry meadow. It’s a town tradition, Detective. Has been since my grandfather’s day. The one night Stillwater truly comes together. The one night we remember we’re more than just neighbors; we’re keepers of the same flame.” The metaphor rolled out, polished from use.

He launched into a speech of rehearsed warmth: the communal stacking of the pyre weeks in advance, the solemn procession at dusk, the lighting of the flame as the last sliver of sun vanished behind the pines. Children toasting marshmallows, elders sharing stories of harder times, the whole town reflected in the flickering orange light. “It’s about unity,” Briggs emphasized, his hands finally setting the cup down with a faint *clink*. “About showing the dark that we are not afraid, because we are together.”

“You see,” he said, finally looking at Elias with earnest, pleading eyes that didn’t quite reach a genuine smile, “no one could have done this. We were all together. Every soul in Stillwater. Ask anyone. You’ll see.”

Elias did. Walking the length of River Street, mist beaded on his worn trench coat like cold sweat. The shop bells that jingled at his entrance sounded like alarms. Inside Stillwater Provisions, the air thick with the smells of ground coffee, dried herbs, and cinnamon, a woman with kind eyes and flour-dusted arms told the same story while weighing out beans with mechanical precision. “Oh, the bonfire was lovely. Leo Finch got the blaze going higher than ever. You could feel the heat on your face from fifty feet back. We were all there, dear. All of us.” In the damp-smelling bookshop, where silence lay like a palpable layer of dust, the elderly proprietor peered over spectacles and echoed the sentiment without looking up from his ledger. “A communal vigil, Detective. A reaffirmation of our bonds against the long dark. No one would miss it. To miss it is… unthinkable.”

Absolute, seamless uniformity defined each account. They dovetailed not just in broad strokes, but in the peculiar details—the specific height of the flames (“ten feet at least, roaring!”), the exact song old Mr. Henderson played on his fiddle (“*The Drunken Sailor*, then *Ash Grove*”), the moment a shower of sparks spiraled up into the black like inverted stars. A script, beautifully performed. A haunting, airtight chorus.

His notebook filled with names—Briggs, Henderson, the shopkeepers—all appended with the same three words: *At the bonfire*. The repetition itself felt like a spell, an incantation meant to ward him off.

The most detailed account came from Beatrice Cole. She lived in a gingerbread-trimmed cottage at the edge of the dense, encroaching woods, its garden a tangle of night-darkened roses. Inside, books overflowed and the dry, papery scent of pressed flowers and slow decay permeated the air. Stillwater’s self-appointed historian, a woman in her seventies, possessed a spine as straight as a ruler and eyes the colour of flint.

“Detective Crowe,” she said, ushering him into a parlour so crowded with artifacts under glass it felt like a museum tomb. A rusted logging saw, a collection of clay pipes, a tattered regimental flag, a locket with a faded daguerreotype. “You’re investigating the unpleasantness at the Clock Tower. I suppose you’ve heard about our alibi.” She said “alibi” as if it were a vulgar, modern word.

“It’s come up, yes.”

“It’s not an ‘alibi,’” she corrected, settling into a wingback chair that seemed to embrace her. “It’s a fact. The Summer Solstice Bonfire is the spine of our year. It’s… sacred. Pagan roots, of course, long since baptized into community spirit. To miss it is to declare yourself an outsider. Or a ghost.” A slow, deliberate sip of her tea punctuated the statement. “Silas Thorne was a ghost long before he died. He hadn’t attended in years. Considered it ‘provincial pageantry.’ He preferred his own company, and his own designs, to ours.”

“So he was alone at the Clock Tower.”

“While the rest of us were bound together in light and warmth.”rmth,” she said, her voice softening into a genuine, mournful note that, for a second, felt utterly real. “There’s a poetry to it, however grim. The one man who rejected our community, alone in the dark, while the community thrived without him. A lesson, perhaps.”

“And you can vouch for everyone? The entire town? Without exception?”

Beatrice Cole’s flinty eyes held his, unblinking. “Mayor Briggs stirred the mulled cider with his wife, making a show of it. Leo Finch, our handyman, tended the fire’s edges like a priest at an altar. Eleanor Vance, of course, sat in her wheelchair near the warmth, young Tommy Vale from the pharmacy seeing to her. Shopkeepers, teachers, children. All present. All accounted for.” She leaned forward slightly, the glass case beside her reflecting a distorted sliver of her sharp profile. “It was, Detective, a perfect circle. And a perfect circle has no breaks. No entry. No exit.”

Leaving her house, the walls of the town seemed to close in further, the mist thickening into a cold, needling drizzle. Elias Crowe found Leo Finch in a cluttered workshop behind the old livery, the air thick with the sweet scent of sawdust and the sharp tang of linseed oil. A single bare bulb swung slightly, making shadows of tools leap and crawl. A man of few words, Finch’s hands—scarred, strong, perpetually stained with grease or paint—did most of the talking as he carefully repaired a rocking chair’s broken runner.

“Bonfire,” he grunted in response to Elias Crowe’s question, not looking up from his work. His voice was like gravel under a boot. “Started it. Maintained it. Doused it. Took me an hour after everyone left to make sure the embers were dead. Can’t risk a spark in those pines.”

“You see everyone there? The whole time?”

“Saw enough.” He planed a piece of wood with a long, whispering *shush* that filled the silence. “Whole town’s a fishbowl. You’re always seen. Always known.”

“Even by a woman in a wheelchair? She’d have a fixed vantage point.”

Finch’s plane halted for a second, the silence sudden and heavy. Then the rhythmic *shushing* resumed, a fraction harder. “Especially by her. Center of things, she was. Always is. People orbit. They check in.” He finally glanced up, his eyes dark and unreadable in the deep sockets of his face. “You asking if someone could slip away? From that light? Into that dark?” He gave a short, dismissive shake of his head and returned to his wood. “Would be like tearing off your own shadow.”

The conversation was like trying to grasp smoke. Each identical interview stoked a slow-burning frustration in Elias Crowe’s gut. Yet his mind, trained to find the flaw in the pattern, began to work around the edges of this perfect communal alibi. A circle, as Beatrice Cole said, has no breaks. But what if the circle itself was the crime? What if the collective witness was not alibi, but apparatus?

Afternoon bleared into a damp, early twilight. Elias Crowe found a stool at the dim end of The Leaky Bucket, the town’s only pub. The place was quiet, the air stale with yesterday’s beer and today’s silence, the floorboards sticky. He ordered a ale and replayed the statements in his head, and as he did, the memory of their fervent descriptions conjured the bonfire itself in his mind—not as a dry fact, but as a visceral, overwhelming vision.

***Flashback.***

The quarry meadow was a vast, natural bowl of gathering shadow, the high, jagged walls of cut granite looming black against an indigo sky streaked with the last bloody threads of sunset. At its heart, the pyre was a monstrous beehive of old timber, splintered pallets, and gnarled deadfall. As the last light failed, a reverent hush fell over the hundred-odd souls gathered in a wide, uneven ring. The only sounds were the rustle of woolen coats and the dry whisper of the wind in the tall pines encircling the quarry’s rim. Mayor Briggs, his face solemn in the deepening blue, took a torch from Leo Finch. He didn’t speak. He simply thrust it into the heart of the structure.

The fire did not catch tentatively. It *erupted*. With a sound like a great intake of breath, flames roared up the tinder-dry skeleton, exploding into the twilight with an audible *whoomph*. The crowd gasped as one—a single, communal exhalation of awe and release. The heat was immense, a physical wall that pushed people back a step, their faces instantly gilded and sweating, their shadows becoming long, frantic giants that danced and juddered up the sheer quarry walls.

Children squealed, not in fear, but in primal delight. The firelight transformed familiar faces into masks of light and hollow shadow. Mayor Briggs, smiling broadly now, looked saturnine, his eyes disappearing into dark pits. Beatrice Cole, standing slightly apart, watched with sharp, unblinking eyes, her features seeming carved from ancient, fire-lit wood. Leo Finch moved like a spirit at the periphery, a silhouette against the inferno, using a long pole to shepherd the collapsing, spark-spitting logs with grim expertise.

And there, in the place of honour closest to the warmth but out of the spark-shot chaos, sat Eleanor Vance. A thick tartan blanket was tucked meticulously around her legs. The firelight glinted off the chromed rims of her wheelchair and shone in her gentle, watchful eyes, which moved slowly, serenely, across the crowd. People orbited her—bringing her cups of steaming cider, stopping to bend and chat, young Tommy Vale kneeling beside her to point at something in the flames. She was the still, accepting center of the whirling, fiery ritual. She saw everyone. Everyone saw her. Her presence was a quiet anchor, making the frenzy around her feel sanctioned, safe.

The fiddle sawed a frantic reel, feet stamped on the hard-packed earth, laughter rose and was swallowed by the crackling, roaring appetite of the fire. It was beautiful. It was pagan. It was utterly binding. For those two hours, Stillwater was not a collection of individuals, but a single organism, breathing in the resinous smoke, breathing out the same songs, its shared light holding back the vast, pressing dark of the The dense, encroaching woods surrounding the town. To look away from that flame, to slip away into the surrounding night, would feel like a kind of self-annihilation. An impossibility.

***End Flashback.***

Elias Crowe shook the vision off, taking a long, bitter pull of his ale. The alibi was perfect because it wasn’t fabricated. It was *lived*. It was a truth so powerful, so consuming, it could conceal another, darker truth within its brilliant, blinding light. He was pondering this, the weight of the entire town’s collective gaze feeling like a physical pressure on his shoulders, when the pub door opened with a creak, letting in a gust of wet, cold air and the smell of sodden leaves.

A young deputy from the county sheriff’s office stood there, his plastic-covered hat dripping onto the floorboards. He spotted Elias Crowe, his eyes widening with a mix of nerves and importance, and hurried over, holding out a sealed manila envelope.

“For you, Detective. Rushed over from the county seat. Coroner’s initial report and the evidence log from the scene.”

Elias Crowe took it, a cold knot tightening in his gut. He thanked the deputy and waited until the boy left, the door sighing shut behind him, before sliding his thumb under the flap. The sound of tearing paper was obscenely loud in the quiet room. The documents inside were crisp, clinical, an intrusion of sterile modernity into Stillwater’s damp, living past.

The cause of death was straightforward: a single, deep stab wound to the heart, delivered with considerable, likely downward, force. Time of death estimated between 8:30 and 9:30 PM. Silas Thorne had put up no fight; there were no defensive wounds, no signs of a struggle. He had been taken by surprise, or had known his killer intimately enough to turn his back.

Elias Crowe’s eyes scanned down the inventory of personal effects, the description of the victim’s clothing, the minutiae of death. Then he reached the section on the murder weapon. It had not been found at the scene. The wound geometry suggested a narrow, triangular blade, approximately seven inches long, with a sharp point and a single cutting edge—a tool designed for piercing. The killer had taken it with them.

Attached was a supplemental note from the coroner, a meticulous man. He had consulted with a historian friend on the unique wound characteristics. His professional opinion, based on the clean, deep puncture and the slight, distinctive tearing at the entry point from a decorative guard, was that the weapon was likely an antique letter opener, of a style popular in the late Victorian era. Specifically, one with a blade of polished Sheffield steel, a sterling silver guard fashioned in the shape of a coiled serpent, and a handle of polished hematite.

Elias Crowe’s blood turned to ice. He had seen that description before. Not in a report, but in life, not an hour ago.

He fumbled in his pocket for his notebook, flipping past the pages of identical statements. His fingers felt numb. There, in the meticulous notes from his visit to Beatrice Cole’s cluttered cottage. Among the artifacts under glass, she had pointed out a few prized pieces with a curator’s pride: a locket belonging to the town’s founding mother, a silver spoon from the long-gone hotel… and a matched set of Victorian writing desk implements, donated by the Vance family years ago. “The letter opener is particularly fine,” she’d said, tapping the glass with a bony finger. “A serpent guard. Quite rare. A piece of history.”

Elias Crowe’s eyes snapped back to the coroner’s report. The clinical description was an exact match. But the coroner had appended one final, devastating line, a line that shattered the perfect, circular alibi and plunged the mystery into a deeper, darker well. A line that made the collective memory of the bonfire seem not just binding, but conspiratorial.

***Item of Note: The Stillwater Historical Society records indicate a letter opener matching this exact description was part of their permanent collection. It was reported missing two days ago by the Society’s curator, Miss Beatrice Cole.***
