Chapter 7: Divide and Conquer

The silence in the house was no longer empty. It was a living thing, a third occupant in every room, thick and velvety with mistrust. It had been forty-eight hours since Elara Vance's failed escape, since the revelation of the Warden's true demand. The bruise on her temple, a splash of ochre and plum, was a constant visual anchor to their powerlessness. She spent her days at the dining table, now a command center buried under a paper avalanche of discovery documents for the case of The People v. Aris Thorne. The fugitive's face—sharp, aristocratic, cold—stared up from photographs, a ghost haunting their prison.
Leo moved through the rooms like a man moving through a minefield. He prepared meals that went half-eaten, attempted jokes that died in the dense air. His attempts to bridge the gap between his wife's grim, single-minded focus and his daughter's retreat into a sullen, digital shell were met with polite, distant failure.
Chloe had become a ghost in her own home. She spent hours curled in the window seat of the living room, her forehead pressed against the cool, unyielding polymer, watching the artificial dusk paint the false sky. The Warden's voice had started visiting her alone. It would whisper from her phone, from the smart speaker in her bedroom, an intimate, paternal murmur.
"You are not a prisoner, Chloe. You are a bystander. Your mother's choices have consequences, but they need not be yours."

She'd stopped answering aloud. She'd just listen, her heart a trapped bird against her ribs. The silence was a heavy blanket that suffocated her, making it hard to breathe. She like she was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, with no lifeline in sight.
The offer came on the morning of the third day. Her phone chimed with a unique, melodic tone she'd never heard before. A text, from a blank number.
The Warden: The garden door is unlocked. Walk through it. All we require is perspective. Your mother is working on something beyond the Thorne case. Help us see it. Then go.
A photo followed. It was the back garden door, the one that led to the high-walled enclosure. The deadbolt was shown retracted. Her breath hitched. She could almost feel the phantom touch of real wind, smell something other than recycled air and anxiety. The scent of damp earth and greenery wafted through her mind, transporting her to a place she'd never been.
The Warden: Simple observations. Is she taking notes on paper we don't provide? Does she speak in codes with your father? Where does her mind go when she stares at the wall? We don't ask for betrayal. We ask for clarity.
Clarity. The word was a clean, bright thing in the murk of their existence. Betrayal was a rotten, complicated one. They warred in her gut as she watched her mother at the table. Elara Vance was muttering to herself, a pen clenched in her teeth, her fingers tracing a line of legal text. She looked like a stranger. An obsessed, wounded stranger who had gotten them into this.
"What are you working on?" Chloe asked, her voice sounding too loud.
Elara Vance didn't look up. "The motion to dismiss. Thorne's extradition was flawed."

"Is that all?" Chloe asked, her voice laced with skepticism.
A pause. Elara Vance's eyes flickered, just for a millisecond, to a blank corner of the notepad beside her. "It's what needs to be done to get us out of here."

A lie. Chloe tasted it, metallic and sour. Her mother's tells were subtle—a slight tightening of the jaw, a deliberate stillness—but to a daughter, they were neon signs. She was working on something else. Something secret. Something that was, perhaps, keeping them here.
The silence in the house pressed down, a physical weight on Chloe's lungs. The image of the unlocked door floated behind her eyes. Go. She shiver run down her spine as she typed back, her thumbs cold and clumsy.
Chloe: She's hiding notes. In the binding of the John Grisham novel on the shelf. She and dad talk about the news. They use headlines to mean other things. I don't know what.
She hit send. The guilt was immediate, a hot flush that climbed from her chest to her cheeks. She had given them something. But she had also given them nothing. The Grisham novel was a decoy Elara Vance had planted days ago, a test. The news-code was a fiction. She was feeding the beast crumbs, hoping it would be satisfied and open the door.
The Warden: Good. Continue. The door remains unlocked for you.
For the next day, Chloe played her part. She reported on Elara Vance's coffee consumption, on her muttered arguments with legal precedents, on her restless sleep. She sprinkled in more fictions: that Elara Vance was trying to calculate the house's power grid from the hum of the lights, that she was teaching Leo Morse code by tapping her wedding ring. Each message like shedding a piece of her skin. She avoided her father's concerned eyes. She couldn't meet her mother's at all.
The fracture became a chasm during dinner. Leo had made pasta, a desperate offering of normalcy.
"We need to talk about a united front," he said, twirling fettuccine without appetite. "If the goal is to get you to win this case, Elara Vance, then we all need to be on the same page. No more side projects."

Elara Vance's head snapped up. "Side projects? Leo, winning this case is the cover. The precedent, Zephyr Holdings v. Denmark—it's the lock on our cage. If I can find a key, it doesn't matter if I win or lose Thorne's case. The whole The Voice they've built collapses."

"And if you don't find this mythical key? If you antagonize them and they..." He trailed off, glancing at Chloe.
"And they what? Hurt her? Hurt you? They're already doing that!" Elara Vance's voice rose, sharp with frayed nerves. "Every second in here is a harm. I am trying to end it, not negotiate a better quality of imprisonment!"

"By lying to us?" The words were out of Chloe's mouth before she could stop them, sharp and brittle.
The table went silent. The hum of the refrigerator appeared to swell. The air was thick with tension, like a physical presence that pressed against their skin.
"What did you say?" Elara Vance asked, her voice dangerously low.
Chloe's courage faltered, but the weight of her secret, the phantom promise of the unlocked door, pushed her on. "You're lying. You're not simply working on the precedent. You're doing something else. Something you're not telling us. And it's making it worse."

Elara Vance's eyes narrowed, the lawyer's gaze now turned on her own. "How dare you," she whispered, her voice trembling with anger.
Leo's face was a mask of concern, but Chloe saw the flicker of something else in his eyes. A spark of recognition, perhaps, or a glimmer of understanding.
"I'm sorry," Chloe said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I just...I don't know what's going on, Mom. I feel like I'm losing you."

Elara Vance's expression softened merely st for a moment. "I'm not losing you, Chloe. I'm just trying to find a way out. A way to make things right."

The words hung in the air, a fragile promise of hope. But Chloe knew better. She knew that the Warden's game was far from over, and that their lives were still hanging in the balance.
As the dinner plates were cleared, Chloe feelings of unease settle over her. She knew that she had to keep playing the game, to keep feeding the beast crumbs of information. But she also knew that she couldn't keep living like this, trapped in a world of secrets and lies.
The door creaked open, a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the plants outside. Chloe shiver run down her spine as she realized that the Warden was watching, waiting for her next move.
She took a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew what she had to do. She had to keep playing the game, no matter how much it hurt. But she also knew that she couldn't keep living like this, trapped in a world of secrets and lies.
As she walked away from the table, Chloe felthints off determination rising up inside her. She would find a way out, no matter what it took. She would uncover the truth, and she would make things right.
But for now, she had to keep playing the game. She had to keep feeding the beast crumbs of information, hoping that it would eventually open the door.
The Warden's voice whispered in her ear, a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the plants outside. "Keep playing, Chloe. Keep playing."

Chloe's heart raced as she walked away from the table, her eyes fixed on the door. She knew that she had to keep going, no matter what. She had to keep playing the game, no matter how much it hurt.
As she reached the door, Chloe atrepidation rising up inside her. She knew that she was taking a risk, but she also knew that she had to try.
She turned the handle, and the door creaked open, revealing a world outside that was both familiar and strange. The air was cool and fresh, filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the sound of birds singing.
Chloe took a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew that she had to be careful, that she had to watch her step. But she also knew that she had to keep going, no matter what.
The world outside was a complex web of secrets and lies, but Chloe was determined to uncover the truth. She was determined to make things right, no matter what it took.
As she strode away from the house, Chloe feelings ofsing up inside her. She knew that she had to keep going, no matter what. She had to keep playing the game, no matter how much it hurt.
But for now, she had to be careful. She had to watch her step, and she had to be prepared for anything.
As she walked away from the house, Chloe sense ofhints oftion rising up inside her. She knew that she had to keep going, no matter what. She had to uncover the truth, and she had to make things right.
As she disappeared into the distance, the silence in the house grew thicker, a heavy blanket that suffocated the occupants. The Warden's voice whispered in the darkness, a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the plants outside.
"Keep playing, Chloe. Keep playing."
