Chapter 7: Divide and Conquer

The silence in the house was no longer empty. It was a living thing, a third occupant in every room, thick and velvety with mistrust. It had been forty-eight hours since Elara’s failed escape, since the revelation of the Warden’s true demand. The bruise on her temple, a splash of ochre and plum, was a constant visual anchor to their powerlessness. She spent her days at the dining table, now a command center buried under a paper avalanche of discovery documents for the case of The People v. Aris Thorne. The fugitive’s face—sharp, aristocratic, cold—stared up from photographs, a ghost haunting their prison.

Leo moved through the rooms like a man navigating a minefield. He prepared meals that went half-eaten, attempted jokes that died in the dense air. His attempts to bridge the gap between his wife’s grim, single-minded focus and his daughter’s retreat into a sullen, digital shell were met with polite, distant failure.

Chloe had become a ghost in her own home. She spent hours curled in the window seat of the living room, her forehead pressed against the cool, unyielding polymer, watching the artificial dusk paint the false sky. The Warden’s voice had started visiting her alone. It would whisper from her phone, from the smart speaker in her bedroom, an intimate, paternal murmur.

“You are not a prisoner, Chloe. You are a bystander. Your mother’s choices have consequences, but they need not be yours.”

She’d stopped answering aloud. She’d just listen, her heart a trapped bird against her ribs.

The offer came on the morning of the third day. Her phone chimed with a unique, melodic tone she’d never heard before. A text, from a blank number.

The Warden: The garden door is unlocked. Walk through it. All we require is perspective. Your mother is working on something beyond the Thorne case. Help us see it. Then go.

A photo followed. It was the back garden door, the one that led to the high-walled enclosure. The deadbolt was shown retracted. Her breath hitched. She could almost feel the phantom touch of real wind, smell something other than recycled air and anxiety.

The Warden: Simple observations. Is she taking notes on paper we don’t provide? Does she speak in codes with your father? Where does her mind go when she stares at the wall? We don’t ask for betrayal. We ask for clarity.

Clarity. The word was a clean, bright thing in the murk of their existence. Betrayal was a rotten, complicated one. They warred in her gut as she watched her mother at the table. Elara was muttering to herself, a pen clenched in her teeth, her fingers tracing a line of legal text. She looked like a stranger. An obsessed, wounded stranger who had gotten them into this.

“What are you working on?” Chloe asked, her voice sounding too loud.

Elara didn’t look up. “The motion to dismiss. Thorne’s extradition was flawed.”

“Is that all?”

A pause. Elara’s eyes flickered, just for a millisecond, to a blank corner of the notepad beside her. “It’s what needs to be done to get us out of here.”

A lie. Chloe tasted it, metallic and sour. Her mother’s tells were subtle—a slight tightening of the jaw, a deliberate stillness—but to a daughter, they were neon signs. She was working on something else. Something secret. Something that was, perhaps, keeping them here.

The silence in the house pressed down, a physical weight on Chloe’s lungs. The image of the unlocked door floated behind her eyes. Go.

She typed back, her thumbs cold and clumsy.

Chloe: She’s hiding notes. In the binding of the John Grisham novel on the shelf. She and dad talk about the news. They use headlines to mean other things. I don’t know what.

She hit send. The guilt was immediate, a hot flush that climbed from her chest to her cheeks. She had given them something. But she had also given them nothing. The Grisham novel was a decoy Elara had planted days ago, a test. The news-code was a fiction. She was feeding the beast crumbs, hoping it would be satisfied and open the door.

The Warden: Good. Continue. The door remains unlocked for you.

For the next day, Chloe played her part. She reported on Elara’s coffee consumption, on her muttered arguments with legal precedents, on her restless sleep. She sprinkled in more fictions: that Elara was trying to calculate the house’s power grid from the hum of the lights, that she was teaching Leo Morse code by tapping her wedding ring. Each message felt like shedding a piece of her skin. She avoided her father’s concerned eyes. She couldn’t meet her mother’s at all.

The fracture became a chasm during dinner. Leo had made pasta, a desperate offering of normalcy.

“We need to talk about a united front,” he said, twirling fettuccine without appetite. “If the goal is to get you to win this case, Elara, then we all need to be on the same page. No more side projects.”

Elara’s head snapped up. “Side projects? Leo, winning this case is the cover. The precedent, Zephyr Holdings v. Denmark—it’s the lock on our cage. If I can find a key, it doesn’t matter if I win or lose Thorne’s case. The whole system they’ve built collapses.”

“And if you don’t find this mythical key? If you antagonize them and they…” He trailed off, glancing at Chloe.

“And they what? Hurt her? Hurt you? They’re already doing that!” Elara’s voice rose, sharp with frayed nerves. “Every second in here is a harm. I am trying to end it, not negotiate a better quality of imprisonment!”

“By lying to us?” The words were out of Chloe’s mouth before she could stop them, sharp and brittle.

The table went silent. The hum of the refrigerator seemed to swell.

“What did you say?” Elara asked, her voice dangerously low.

Chloe’s courage faltered, but the weight of her secret, the phantom promise of the unlocked door, pushed her on. “You’re lying. You’re not just working on the precedent. You’re doing something else. Something you’re not telling us. And it’s making it worse.”

Elara’s eyes narrowed, the lawyer’s gaze now turned on her own daughter. “How would you know what I’m working on, Chloe?”

The air left the room. Leo looked between them, a man watching a familiar ship break apart on a hidden reef. “Chloe? What’s going on?”

Chloe’s mouth was desert-dry. “They… they talk to me. The Warden. They offered to let me go.”

The confession hung in the air, a toxic cloud. Elara slowly put down her fork. The clink against the porcelain was a gunshot.

“Let you go,” Elara repeated, each word an icicle.

“If I told them what you were really doing.” Chloe’s tears were hot and shameful. “I gave them fake stuff! I just… I wanted the door to be open.”

Elara stood up so quickly her chair screeched against the floor. The bruise on her temple seemed to darken. “You spied on me? You negotiated with our captors?”

“You weren’t telling us the truth either!”

“To protect you!”

“By getting us trapped here in the first place!” Chloe screamed, the weeks of fear finally erupting. “You and your important work and your enemies! We’re here because of you! I just wanted to get out!”

The words were a physical blow. Elara recoiled as if struck. The righteous anger drained from her face, leaving behind a raw, naked devastation that was far worse. Leo stood, a hand out to each.

“Stop it! Both of you! This is what they want!”

“They already have it!” Elara’s voice was a shattered whisper, her eyes locked on Chloe. “They have my daughter trading information for her freedom. They’ve turned my family into their own little panopticon.” She took a step back, her gaze sweeping over Chloe as if seeing a hostile witness. “What did you give them?”

“Nothing real,” Chloe sobbed.

“What did you give them?” Elara’s command was courtroom-hard, leaving no room for evasion.

“The Grisham book! The news thing! I made it up!”

Elara’s face went through a terrifying series of transformations: comprehension, calculation, horror. She lunged not at Chloe, but for the bookshelf. She yanked the Grisham novel free, tearing open its spine.
