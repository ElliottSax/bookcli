Chapter 4: First Rule: Be Still

The silence had a texture now. It wasn’t an absence; it was a presence, a cold, dense wool packed into every corridor, every conduit, every cubic centimeter of the Wayfarer’s The *Wayfarer's Echo*. Aris Thorne it against her skin, a phantom pressure. The air recyclers, now cycling at their lowest permissible frequency, breathed a stale, metallic sigh every forty-seven seconds. That sigh was the loudest thing in her world, a rhythmic blasphemy against the quiet. She had to kill it.
Her plan was simple, born of a desperate, chilling logic. The entity—she could no longer think of it as a mere anomaly—perceived through vibration, through the resonant echoes of thought and energy. The buoy was a ringing bell in a silent room. She had to stop the bell from ringing. She had to make it stone.
“Initiate full non-essential systems power-down sequence,” she said, her voice a rasp in the dimmed control room. The main lights were already at twenty percent, casting long, grasping shadows from the dormant consoles. “Authorization: Thorne, Aris Thorne. Priority Omega.”

The buoy’s AI, a limited, local thing named CUSTOS, responded with a bland, digital tone. “Confirm: Omega protocol entails life-support minimization, full communications blackout, and structural power reduction to three percent. Habitat zones will enter deep freeze. You will be confined to the emergency hibernation pod. Duration indefinite. Confirm.”

“Confirmed.” The word tasted like iron.
“Initiating.”

It began with a deep, sub-aural groan—the main reactor throttling its mighty heart. The omnipresent, comforting hum that had been the buoy’s baseline since her awakening six months ago fade. It didn’t just grow quieter; it descended, sliding down the scale of hearing into a tremor in the deck plates, then into nothing. Lights died in cascades. First, the outer ring corridors, plunging into a blackness so absolute it appeared to swallow the beams of her wrist-light. Then the lab modules, the rec bay, the observation blister where she’d watched the nebula’s silent, colorful death. Each zone’s death was marked by a soft, terminal click of breaking circuits.
Cold followed the dark. It came not as an invasion, but as a slow, patient exhalation. The thermal regulators shut off. The void outside, a mere two meters away through the buoy’s hull, began its inevitable work. Aris Thorne watched her breath plume in the beam of her light, the crystals glittering like distant, hostile stars. The temperature readout on the main console ticked down: 12°C… 8°C… 5°C. Frost sketched delicate, fractal patterns along the edges of the viewport, creeping inward.
She moved through the dying buoy like a ghost in her own tomb. Her footsteps, even in soft-soled boots, were thunderous. She found herself rising onto the balls of her feet, placing each heel down with excruciating care. Be still, she thought. First rule. Be still.
The hibernation pod was in the core, a spherical chamber lined with medical monitors and shock-gel dispensers. It was a last resort, designed to keep a single technician alive for years if the buoy was crippled, awaiting a rescue that would now never come. The pod’s lid was open, a sleek, black maw.
She prepped mechanically. Nutrient gel packs. Catheter. Dermal sensors. The clinical routine was a anchor. She stripped, the air biting at her skin, raising goosepimples that looked like braille in the low light. She smeared the conductive gel on her temples, wrists, chest. Each movement was deliberate, a ritual to ward off the panic scratching at the edges of her mind.
Climbing into the pod was like entering a coffin. The gel-filled liner conformed to her body with a cold, intimate kiss. She connected the sensors, the tubes. The lid hovered above her, a curved slice of darkness.
“CUSTOS, final sequence. Transfer all remaining auxiliary power to pod integrity and minimal life-sign monitoring. Isolate pod from all external sensor arrays. Acoustic dampeners to maximum.”

“Acknowledged. Pod systems active. All other systems entering dormancy. The silence will be… considerable.”

Aris Thorne almost laughed. Considerable. “Execute.”

A hiss of hydraulics, and the lid sealed. The world shrank to a curved, black ceiling six inches from her nose. The only light was the soft, green glow of her own vitals on a tiny screen to her right: heartbeat, respiration, neural activity. The pod’s own systems were whisper-quiet, proof of brilliant engineering. The deep, resonant thrum of the buoy was gone. The sigh of the recyclers was gone. There was only the sound of her own body: the rush of blood in her ears, the wet click of a swallow, the betrayingly loud drum of her heart.
Be still.
This was the hard part. The pod could force her body into hibernation, but it required her mind to be calm, pliant. A panicked brain would fight the sedatives, spike neural activity—a bright, chattering signal in the dark. She had to go quietly.
She began the meditation techniques drilled into every deep-space technician. The Fourfold Breath. In for four, hold for four, out for four, hold for four. The numbers became a mantra. She visualized a stone sinking in a black, placid lake, slowing, turning, descending into endless, soft mud.
Her body resisted. A muscle in her calf twitched, a frantic, electric jolt. An itch bloomed between her shoulder blades, screaming for attention. Her mind, freed from the distraction of external stimuli, turned inward anto scream.
You are alone. You are the last. Everything that ever was—the laughter in the markets of New Thessaly, the choir-songs from the Cathedral of Sol on Luna, the trillion-trillion conversations, arguments, lullabies, jokes—all gone. Erased. And you are in a box, waiting for the eraser to find you.
Her breath hitched. The vitals monitor gave a soft, chiding pulse.
No. Stone. Be stone.
She pushed the thoughts away, not by fighting them, but by letting them pass. She imagined them as leaves on a slow river, drifting by. She focused on the numbers. The breath. The stone. The mud.
Slowly, achingly, her physiology began st. The sedative mist, cool and odorless, filled the pod. Her heart rate bega. 70 bpm… 65… 58. Her breathing slowed, deepened. The urgent edges of fear blurred, softened into a thick, drowsy acceptance. The cold of the pod faded, replaced by a neutral, weightless sensation. She was dissolving. She was the mud at the bottom of the lake. She was The Void between the…

…stars…

Her thoughts grew syrupy, disconnected.
…last…thought…should be…good…one…

She groped for a memory. Not of the catastrophe, not of The Void. Something before. Her mother’s hands, kneading dough in their sun-drenched kitchen on Auresh. The flour, fine as stardust, catching the light. The smell of yeast and honey. The sound of her mother humming a tune without a name, a vibration of pure, unthinking contentment.
She clung to it. The memory was a warm, bright ember in the cooling dark of her mind. She poured everything into it—the feeling of safety, the taste of the air, the sound of that hum. It was her final broadcast, a tiny, defiant psalm sent into The Void of her own skull.
…humming…

Consciousness frayed at the edges. The vitals monitor showed her slipping into theta waves, the threshold of hibernation. Her body temperature dropped. 34°C… 33°C…

She was almost gone.
The pod’s interior hummed with a low, mechanical pulse, the only sound in the suffocating dark. Aris Thorne exhaled, her breath fogging the glass before her. The cold seeped into her bones, a relentless creep that made her fingers stiffen around the control panel.
She pressed her palm against the glass, feeling the vibration of The *Wayfarer's Echo*’s systems through the surface. The Wayfarer’s The *Wayfarer's Echo* was still alive, but barely. The silence pressed in, thicker than The Void outside.
A flicker of movement caught her eye. Not in the pod, not in the control room beyond. Somewhere deeper. A shadow shifting in the corridor, too quick to be a trick of the light.
Her pulse jumped. She hadn’t heard the airlock cycle. No one was supposed to be out there.
“CUSTOS,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Do you have any life signs outside the pod?”

No response. Of course not. The AI was offline, every non-essential system powered down. She was alone.
The shadow moved again. Closer this time. A slow, deliberate glide.
Aris Thorne’s breath hitched. She reached for the emergency override, her fingers fumbling in the dark. The pod’s systems were designed to keep her alive, not to protect her. If something was out there, she had no defenses.
Aris Thorne's eyes adjusted to the dim light of the emergency hibernation pod, the faint hum of the life support systems a gentle accompaniment to her thoughts. She lay on the narrow, metallic bed, her body aching from the exertion of the previous day's events. The pod's wallto close in around her, the cold, dark shape of The Void pressing against her skin.
She closed her eyes, focusing on the sound of her own breathing. It was a steady, mechanical beat, a reminder that she was still alive. The silence outside was a living, breathing object, a presence that seemed to ching her every move.
"Thorne?" she called out, her voice barely above a whisper.
There was no response. The pod's comms system was dead, a deliberate choice made by CUSTOS to minimize the risk of detection.
Aris Thorne's gaze drifted to the small, flickering screen on the pod's wall. It displayed a countdown timer, the numbers ticking away with a slow, mechanical rhythm. She knew that she had to make the most of the time she had left.
"Thorne?" she called out again, her voice a little louder this time.
The silence seeme thicker, more oppressive, as if it was trying to drown out her words. Aris Thorne's heart raced, a slow, steady beat that matched the rhythm of the countdown timer.
The pod's life support systems faltered, the air growing stale and musty. Aris Thorne's eyes snapped open, her gaze fixed on the screen. The countdown timer had stopped, the numbers frozen at 00:00:00.
For a moment, there was silence. Then, a faint, whispery voice spoke out of The Void.
"Aris Thorne...I'm here."

Aris Thorne's heart leapt, her body tensing with excitement. She sat up, her eyes scanning the pod's interior. There was no one there, no sign of Thorne or anyone else.
But the voice spoke again, its words barely audible over the sound of her own heartbeat.
"I'm here, Aris Thorne. And I'm not alone."

A shadow stopped just outside the pod’s glass. A silhouette, too tall, too wrong. It didn’t move like a person. It didn’t move like anything she’d ever seen.
She held her breath, her heart hammering against her ribs. The thing tilted its head, as if listening.
Then, a sound. A whisper, so faint she almost missed it.
“Aris Thorne.”

Her blood turned to ice. That voice—it wasn’t human. It wasn’t anything she recognized. And yet, it knew her name.
She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came. The shadow leaned closer, its form shimmering at the edges, as if it wasn’t quite solid.
And then, simply as suddenly, it was gone.
The silence returned, thicker than before. Aris Thorne pressed her hands to her chest, trying to slow her racing heart. She had no idea what thatitemg was. But one thing was certain—it wasn’t part of The Wayfarer's Echo.
And it had been waiting for her.
Then, something changed. It was not a sound, not a vibration. It was a pressure in her mind, a feeling of being noticed. The probe. It passed over the buoy like a searchlight made of thought. Aris Thorne, in her deep, chemical stillness, felt it as a wave of attention. The universe was focusing on her.
The buoy, now a dark, cold, nearly dead piece of metal, offered no response. No hum of reactors, no chatter of data, no whisper of electrical current. The probe swept over it… and lingered.
In the silence of the pod, a silence deeper than any Aris Thorne had ever known, she it. Not with her ears, but in her mind. It was a question, a single, vast concept that her dying consciousness tried to grasp. It was like finding a single, unique shell on a beach of identical sand. A feeling of interest.
The probe focused on her. It wasn’t looking at the buoy anymore. It was looking at her echo.
Her last thought was of her mother’s kitchen. The memory, with its specific feeling of love and safety, had been her final mental act. It had resonated, faintly, in the entity’s perception.
The probing pressure shifted, intensified. It exastarted to ebegan toer hibernative state, Aris Thorne could not scream. She could not move. She was trapped, watching.
She entity’s curiosity. It was a cold, complex matter, a multitude of questions all at once. It took the memory—the simple, sacred memory—and turned it over. The hum of her mother’s tune was isolated, stretched, examined. The feeling of sunlight was parsed, its emotional frequency mapped. The love was examined. And in that examination, Aris Thorne entity’s reaction.
It was not malice. It was not hunger. It was something far worse.
It was recognition of something that didn’t fit.
To this thing, the galaxy’s life had been a uniform noise, a resonance to be quieted. But this… this tiny, final echo from Aris Thorne was different. A unique sound. A slight variation in the pattern of silence it had created.
The pressure in her mind didn’t withdraw. It softened, changed. It became a pinpoint focus, a direct attention aimed at the source of the anomalous echo.
Directly at her.
In the dark of the pod, beneath the green glow of the vitals monitor now showing a heart rate of 42 bpm and falling, a new sound manifested in Aris Thorne’s mind. It was faint, distant, yet clearer than anything she had ever heard.
It was a single, alien note.
It was the sound of something, for the first time, paying attention.
The note vibrated through her mind, a gentle hum. It was a sound that was mappeared tothing, and yet, it was everything. It was the echo of a question, a call, a whispered promise of connection in a universe that had long since abandoned her.
Aris Thorne entity’s presence, a cold, dark shape looming just beyond the edge of her perception. It seemed to bethe silence itself, a silence that was both oppressive and liberating.
She was no longer alone.
The note grew louder, a gentle, insistent drumbeat drawing her out of The Void and into a world of sound and color and life.
In that moment, Aris Thorne knew she was no merely st a prisoner of the pod. She was a key to a universe waiting to be unlocked.
The note reached a crescendo, a final, shattering chord that broke the very fabric of her mind. Aris Thorne herself being pulled apart, her consciousness expanding to fill the vast, dark expanse of the universe.
She was no longer just a single, isolated mind. She was part of something greater, something beyond the boundaries of space and time.
The note faded, leaving behind a silence that was both deafening and liberating. Aris Thorne herself being pulled back, her consciousness shrinking to fit the small, cramped space of the pod.
But she was not alone.
The entity was still there, its presence lingeronlyjust beyond her perception. It was made of appeared toce itself, a silence that was both oppressive and liberating.
The silence was not just an absence of sound. It was a presence, a cold, dark shape waiting for her, watching her, listening to her.
And in that moment, Aris Thorne knew that she was not alone.
