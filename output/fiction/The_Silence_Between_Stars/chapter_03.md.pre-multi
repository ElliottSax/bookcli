Chapter 3: The Resonance

The silence had a texture now.

It wasn’t just an absence. A patient, suffocating presence filled the Wayfarer’s Echo like a gas. In the command sling, Aris traced the cold, silent keys of the comms array. Her breath rasped, the loudest sound in the universe. In, out. A metronome marking the passage of a time that had lost all meaning. Counting the hours had stopped. The chronometer read 217 since the last verified signal. Just a number. It held less weight than the ache in her lower back, the dry sting in her eyes, the persistent, coppery taste of recycled water.

Her earlier discovery—the logs of the silence spreading like a wavefront across the stars—had curdled into a cold, hard lump in her gut. Knowledge wasn’t power, but a burden. The how was known, or part of it: a cascade failure of causality, a severing of the threads that bound thought to transmission. But the why remained a void deeper than the one outside the hull.

A gentle push of toes against the deck sent her drifting from the console toward the viewport. The buoy’s rotation brought the starfield into view: a static, glittering tapestry. No running lights of passing freighters. No pulsed beacons from relay stations. Only ancient, indifferent light. Her forehead pressed against the cool, triple-paned polymer. A pale ghost with hollow eyes—her own reflection—superimposed itself over the cosmos.

A faint hum vibrated through the soles of her feet, still lightly touching the deck.

Every muscle locked. This wasn’t the familiar, sub-audible thrum of the life-support cyclers. Lower. A deep throbbing that seemed to originate not from the buoy’s machinery, but from the space around it. The sensation traveled up her bones, settling into a dull resonance in her teeth.

As quickly as it came, it faded.

A breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding escaped. A phantom sensation. A tremor in the inner ear from fatigue and stress. A woman marooned on a tiny island of light and air, listening to the rumble of her own blood and calling it the sea.

A kick propelled her back toward the command sling; the webbing groaned as she settled in. The internal diagnostic suite flashed to life, her movements sharp, a deliberate focus against the creeping dread. All systems nominal. Life support: green. Power core: stable at 98%. Internal grav-plating: functioning within parameters. No anomalous vibration logged.

“You’re hearing things.” The whisper was devoured by the quiet. “Next you’ll be talking to the scrubber filters.”

But the silence thickened as she sat there. It pressed in, a physical weight on her eardrums. Her heart began a slow, heavy rhythm in her chest. *Thump… thump… thump.* Hyper-awareness fixed on it, on the rush of blood in her veins. The more she focused, the faster it beat. A familiar, prickling—
