Chapter 4: First Rule: Be Still

Chapter 4: First Rule: Be Still

The silence had a texture now. It wasn’t an absence; it was a presence, a cold, dense wool packed into every corridor, every conduit, every cubic centimeter of the Wayfarer’s Echo. Aris felt it against her skin, a phantom pressure. The air recyclers, now cycling at their lowest permissible frequency, breathed a stale, metallic sigh every forty-seven seconds. That sigh was the loudest thing in her world, a rhythmic blasphemy against the quiet. She had to kill it.

Her plan was simple, born of a desperate, chilling logic. The entity—she could no longer think of it as a mere anomaly—perceived through vibration, through the resonant echoes of thought and energy. The buoy was a ringing bell in a silent room. She had to stop the bell from ringing. She had to make it stone.

“Initiate full non-essential systems power-down sequence,” she said, her voice a rasp in the dimmed control room. The main lights were already at twenty percent, casting long, grasping shadows from the dormant consoles. “Authorization: Thorne, Aris. Priority Omega.”

The buoy’s AI, a limited, local thing named CUSTOS, responded with a bland, digital tone. “Confirm: Omega protocol entails life-support minimization, full communications blackout, and structural power reduction to three percent. Habitat zones will enter deep freeze. You will be confined to the emergency hibernation pod. Duration indefinite. Confirm.”

“Confirmed.” The word tasted like iron.

“Initiating.”

It began with a deep, sub-aural groan—the main reactor throttling its mighty heart. The omnipresent, comforting hum that had been the buoy’s baseline since her awakening six months ago began to fade. It didn’t just grow quieter; it descended, sliding down the scale of hearing into a tremor in the deck plates, then into nothing. Lights died in cascades. First, the outer ring corridors, plunging into a blackness so absolute it seemed to swallow the beams of her wrist-light. Then the lab modules, the rec bay, the observation blister where she’d watched the nebula’s silent, colorful death. Each zone’s death was marked by a soft, terminal click of breaking circuits.

Cold followed the dark. It came not as an invasion, but as a slow, patient exhalation. The thermal regulators shut off. The void outside, a mere two meters away through the buoy’s hull, began its inevitable work. Aris watched her breath plume in the beam of her light, the crystals glittering like distant, hostile stars. The temperature readout on the main console ticked down: 12°C… 8°C… 5°C. Frost sketched delicate, fractal patterns along the edges of the viewport, creeping inward.

She moved through the dying buoy like a ghost in her own tomb. Her footsteps, even in soft-soled boots, were thunderous. She found herself rising onto the balls of her feet, placing each heel down with excruciating care. Be still, she thought. First rule. Be still.

The hibernation pod was in the core, a spherical chamber lined with medical monitors and shock-gel dispensers. It was a last resort, designed to keep a single technician alive for years if the buoy was crippled, awaiting a rescue that would now never come. The pod’s lid was open, a sleek, black maw.

She prepped mechanically. Nutrient gel packs. Catheter. Dermal sensors. The clinical routine was a anchor. She stripped, the air biting at her skin, raising goosepimples that looked like braille in the low light. She smeared the conductive gel on her temples, wrists, chest. Each movement was deliberate, a ritual to ward off the panic scratching at the edges of her mind.

Climbing into the pod was like entering a coffin. The gel-filled liner conformed to her body with a cold, intimate kiss. She connected the sensors, the tubes. The lid hovered above her, a curved slice of darkness.

“CUSTOS, final sequence. Transfer all remaining auxiliary power to pod integrity and minimal life-sign monitoring. Isolate pod from all external sensor arrays. Acoustic dampeners to maximum.”

“Acknowledged. Pod systems active. All other systems entering dormancy. The silence will be… considerable.”

Aris almost laughed. Considerable. “Execute.”

A hiss of hydraulics, and the lid sealed. The world shrank to a curved, black ceiling six inches from her nose. The only light was the soft, green glow of her own vitals on a tiny screen to her right: heartbeat, respiration, neural activity. The pod’s own systems were whisper-quiet, proof of brilliant engineering. The deep, resonant thrum of the buoy was gone. The sigh of the recyclers was gone. There was only the sound of her own body: the rush of blood in her ears, the wet click of a swallow, the betrayingly loud drum of her heart.

Be still.

This was the hard part. The pod could force her body into hibernation, but it required her mind to be calm, pliant. A panicked brain would fight the sedatives, spike neural activity—a bright, chattering signal in the dark. She had to go quietly.

She began the meditation techniques drilled into every deep-space technician. The Fourfold Breath. In for four, hold for four, out for four, hold for four. The numbers became a mantra. She visualized a stone sinking in a black, placid lake, slowing, turning, descending into endless, soft mud.

Her body resisted. A muscle in her calf twitched, a frantic, electric jolt. An itch bloomed between her shoulder blades, screaming for attention. Her mind, freed from the distraction of external stimuli, turned inward and began to scream.

You are alone. You are the last. Everything that ever was—the laughter in the markets of New Thessaly, the choir-songs from the Cathedral of Sol on Luna, the trillion-trillion conversations, arguments, lullabies, jokes—all gone. Erased. And you are in a box, waiting for the eraser to find you.

Her breath hitched. The vitals monitor gave a soft, chiding pulse.

No. Stone. Be stone.

She pushed the thoughts away, not by fighting them, but by letting them pass. She imagined them as leaves on a slow river, drifting by. She focused on the numbers. The breath. The stone. The mud.

Slowly, achingly, her physiology began to respond. The sedative mist, cool and odorless, filled the pod. Her heart rate began to dip. 70 bpm… 65… 58. Her breathing slowed, deepened. The urgent edges of fear blurred, softened into a thick, drowsy acceptance. The cold of the pod faded, replaced by a neutral, weightless sensation. She was dissolving. She was the mud at the bottom of the lake. She was the silence between the…

…stars…

Her thoughts grew syrupy, disconnected.

…last…thought…should be…good…one…

She groped for a memory. Not of the catastrophe, not of the silence. Something before. Her mother’s hands, kneading dough in their sun-drenched kitchen on Auresh. The flour, fine as stardust, catching the light. The smell of yeast and honey. The sound of her mother humming a tune without a name, a vibration of pure, unthinking contentment.

She clung to it. The memory was a warm, bright ember in the cooling dark of her mind. She poured everything into it—the feeling of safety, the taste of the air, the sound of that hum. It was her final broadcast, a tiny, defiant psalm sent into the void of her own skull.

…humming…

Consciousness frayed at the edges. The vitals monitor showed her slipping into theta waves, the threshold of hibernation. Her body temperature dropped. 34°C… 33°C…

She was almost gone.

Then, it came.

It was not a sound, not a vibration. It was a pressure in the mind, a lens focusing. The probe. It passed over the buoy like a searchlight made of thought. Aris, in her deep, chemical stillness, felt it as a wave of profound attention. It was the universe noticing an atom.

The buoy, now a dark, cold, nearly dead piece of metal, offered no resonance. No thrum of reactors, no chatter of data, no whisper of electrical current. The probe swept over it… and lingered.

In the absolute, engineered silence of the pod, a silence deeper than any Aris had ever known, she heard it.

Not with her ears. It was in the neural pathways, a direct impression, a shape etched onto the static of her own slowing brain.

It was a question. A single, vast, incomprehensible concept, translated by her dying consciousness into something she could almost grasp. It was the feeling of a child finding a single, perfectly preserved seashell on a beach of endless, identical sand. A note of… discordant interest.

The probe focused. It wasn’t looking at the buoy anymore. It was looking at the echo.

Her last thought. The warm, bright ember of her mother’s kitchen. The memory, with its specific, human vibration of love and safety, had been her final mental act. It had resonated, faintly, in the psychic substrate the entity perceived.

The probing pressure shifted, intensified. It began to… unwind the echo.

In her hibernative state, Aris could not scream. She could not move. She was a prisoner behind her own eyes, deep in the engine room of her soul, watching.

She felt the entity’s curiosity. It was an icy, fractal thing, a billion razor-edged questions all at once. It took the memory—the simple, sacred memory—and turned it over in a dimension she could not comprehend.

The hum of her mother’s tune was isolated, stretched, examined. The feeling of sunlight was parsed, its emotional frequency mapped. The love was… tasted. And in that tasting, Aris felt the entity’s reaction.

It was not malice. It was not hunger. It was something far worse.

It was recognition of anomaly.

To this thing, the entire galaxy’s chorus of life had been a uniform noise, a resonance to be quieted. But this… this tiny, final echo from Aris Thorne was different. A unique harmonic. A slight, strange variation in the pattern of silence it had created.

The pressure in her mind didn’t withdraw. It softened, changed quality. It became a pinpoint focus, a needle of attention aimed directly at the source of the anomalous echo.

Directly at her.

In the perfect, frozen dark of the pod, beneath the green glow of the vitals monitor now showing a heart rate of 42 bpm and falling, a new sound manifested in the heart of Aris’s hibernating mind. It was faint, impossibly distant, yet clearer than anything she had ever heard.

It was a single, alien note.

It was the sound of something, for the first time, leaning in to listen.
