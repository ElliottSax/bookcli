Chapter 11: The Singing Hull

Chapter 11: The Singing Hull

The silence had changed.

For days, Aris had lived in the pre-linguistic hum of her own biology, a creature of breath and heartbeat and the slow, cold burn of vigilance. She had become a stone at the bottom of a dark sea, thinking only in pressures and temperatures. The entity’s attention had been a distant, diffuse thing, a fog of wrongness pressing against the buoy’s skin. It had been listening for a symphony and found only a single, sustained note.

Now, the note was cracking.

It started as a sub-aural tremor, a vibration that traveled up from the deck-plates into the marrow of her teeth. Not a sound, but a feeling of sound, the ghost of a frequency. She was curled in the access conduit behind the main environmental processor, a nest of wires and her own stale breath. Her body knew it before her mind did. It coiled, every muscle a taut wire.

The tremor deepened. A low, harmonic groan seeped through the buoy’s skeleton. It was the sound a planet might make, shifting in its sleep.

Aris’s eyes opened in the pitch black. Her mind, so carefully flattened, spiked with a single, razor-sharp word: Resonance.

The entity wasn’t just listening anymore. It was testing. Tapping. Like a child running a stick along a fence, savoring the rhythmic clatter. It had found a frequency the buoy’s hull liked.

“No,” she breathed, the word alien and dangerous on her lips. Language was a risk, but the thought was a scream. You are stone, you are vacuum, you are nothing.

The groan peaked into a shriek of tormented metal. From somewhere down the spinal corridor, a cacophony of alarms erupted—physical, klaxon bells she’d disconnected from the main system weeks ago. They were her mechanical canaries, and they were dying.

Light followed. Not the soft, bioluminescent strips, but the savage white flash of hull-breach warnings. The conduit around her pulsed with it, a strobe of reality tearing through her carefully maintained darkness.

Move. She had to move.

Her hibernation pod was in the forward blister, a transparent alloy cocoon facing the void. It was her bed, her observation post, her tomb. It was also the most vulnerable point in the entire structure.

Another impact, not a strike but a pull. The sound was obscene. It was the sound of a giant, cosmic zipper. A long, sustained tearing that vibrated through every molecule of the station.

The deck tilted. Aris was thrown against the conduit wall, her shoulder impacting with a dull thud. Gravity was failing; the buoy’s gentle spin was being perturbed. She clawed her way out of the nest, into the corridor. The klaxons were a physical assault, the light a series of frozen tableaus: a loose tool drifting into the air, a spray of coolant mist crystallizing into a glittering cloud, the hair-thin crack that was now racing like silver lightning down the main viewport of the blister.

Towards her pod.

Her sanctuary was now a death trap. The core—the engineering heart of the buoy, a sphere of reinforced tungsten-carbide and lead-crystal—was thirty meters away. Through the open spine.

Exposed.

Her survival suit hung in its locker next to the pod. To reach it was to cross the blister’s open floor, directly before the failing viewport. To not reach it was to die.

Aris moved. Not with panic, but with a glacial, desperate precision. She pushed off the wall, floating into the blister chamber. The viewport was a nightmare canvas. The stars were not right. They smeared, not from motion, but as if seen through a lens of heated air. In their center, a distortion pulsed—a fractal knot of non-light, a hole in reality that drank the starlight and gave back only a profound, structured wrongness. It was the size of a small moon, and it was right there.

The entity had focused. It had found the interesting, silent little pebble that had recently held a thinking mind. And it was peeling it open.

Her suit locker was set into the wall. She reached it, her fingers fumbling with the manual release. The magnetic seals gave with a hiss of equalizing pressure. The suit was a second skin of grey ceramic-composite, cold and stiff. She pulled herself into it, each motion a ritual against the trembling in her hands. Boots, seals, torso, helmet. The world shrank to the rasp of her own breath, the fog forming and vanishing on her faceplate. She connected the umbilical from the suit to the wall, feeding it air and power, buying time.

As she clamped her helmet into place, the hull finally sang its swan song.

With a sound that was less a crash and more a vast, metallic sigh, a section of the forward hull—three meters across, directly above her hibernation pod—curled inward. It didn’t shatter; it peeled, like the skin of a rotten fruit. The void reached in.

Silence. The brutal, absolute silence of vacuum swallowed the klaxons, the groans, everything. Aris’s world became the roar of blood in her ears, the hiss of her suit regulator. Through her faceplate, she watched the horror in mute, terrible clarity.

The air in the blister exploded outward. Her nest of blankets, a data-slate, a water bulb, all were snatched into the maw of the tear and vanished into the star-smeared black. Her hibernation pod, the transparent cocoon, fogged with instant frost before the entire structure collapsed in on itself with a crumple she could feel through her boots. Then it, too, was gone, shredded and ejected into the void.

The entity’s distortion shifted outside. It seemed to pulse, to lean in. It was drinking the vibrations of the rupture, the last dying echoes of the buoy’s structural integrity. It was savoring the noise she had made.

Aris pushed off from the wall, aiming for the open corridor that led to the core. She moved slowly, carefully, trying to be just another piece of debris. But her suit jets gave her away. A tiny, controlled burst to correct her trajectory. A puff of vapor and momentum.

The distortion outside twitched.

It was a subtle reconfiguration, a spiraling tendril of not-light extending towards the buoy, not touching it, but aligning with it. A tuning fork brought near a vibrating string. Her suit’s systems hummed, a low-level EM field for radiation shielding. The hum climbed in pitch, squealing into a frequency that made her teeth ache inside her skull. The entity was tasting her electronic signature.

She drifted into the spinal corridor, a narrow tube lined with conduits and rungs. She grabbed a rung and pulled, manual locomotion. Hand over hand. Each connection of her glove to the metal sent a tiny vibration through the structure. She was a drummer on a skin of metal, and the audience was infinite.

Behind her, through the open door to the ruined blister, she could see it. The fractal distortion had pressed closer. It filled the view, not as an object, but as a condition of space. Stars behind it winked out, not blocked, but unmade, their light stretched into impossible, spiraling paths that led into the heart of the distortion. It had no eyes, no face, but she felt a focus, a attention so vast and pinpoint it crushed her soul. It was listening to the song of her movement, the symphony of her desperate flight.

Her breath came in ragged, too-loud gasps. The core door was at the end of the corridor, a circular hatch of burnished metal, studded with heavy manual locking wheels. It was a vault door. It was home.

She reached it. Her fingers closed around the central locking wheel. It was cold, even through the suit’s insulation. She braced a foot against a bulkhead and pulled.

It didn’t move.

She pulled again, muscles in her back and shoulders screaming. Nothing. The wheel was locked fast. Damage from the vibrations, or a pressure seal engaged by the breach.

A new sound entered her helmet—a thin, high-pitched keening. It was the hull around the core door, stressed to its limit, singing a different, more desperate note. The entity was exploring the new frequency, probing the buoy’s strongest point. Metal fatigued. A hairline crack, luminous with escaping atmosphere, appeared in the corridor wall to her left.

Panic, raw and electric, finally broke through her discipline. She was a rat in a tin pipe, and the tin was being uncrimped.

“Open, damn you!” she screamed into her helmet, the sound swallowed by the dampeners. She threw her whole weight against the wheel, pushing, pulling. It gave a millimeter with a screech that vibrated up her arms.

The keening from the hull rose in pitch and volume. The crack spider-webbed. A fine jet of mist—air, precious air—hissed out, instantly freezing into a plume of ice crystals.

Frantic, physical effort. The phrase from some long-lost manual floated through her terror. This was it. No intellect, no clever plan. Just animal strength against inert metal.

She repositioned, planted both boots on the bulkhead, and gripped the wheel with both hands. She pushed with her legs, pulled with her arms, a grotesque, supine birth against the unyielding hatch. A sob of effort tore from her throat. Her world narrowed to the burn in her muscles, the shriek of metal, the mocking, ethereal song of the dying hull.

With a final, deafening crack, the wheel spun free.

Aris tumbled backward, momentum carrying her into the opposite wall. She scrambled, hauled the heavy door open just wide enough, and slithered through the gap into the dark sanctuary of the core.

The core was a spherical chamber, dominated by the silent, dormant singularity drive—a black, obelisk-like housing in the center. The only light came from a single, small viewport of lead-crystal, a thick, fist-sized eye looking out into the void. She turned, grabbing the inner edge of the door. The corridor outside was a tunnel of nightmare. The cracks were glowing now, veins of lethal energy. The entity’ distortion pressed against the far end of the tube, a wall of impossible geometry that made her mind slide away from it.

She pulled. The door was monstrously heavy. Inch by inch, it swung closed. Through the narrowing slit, she saw a tendril of distorted space extend down the corridor, not touching the walls, but harmonizing with them. The metal itself seemed to waver, to dream of becoming something else.

With a last, grinding heave, the door sealed. She spun the interior locking wheel, engaging thick alloy bolts with solid, satisfying clunks. Silence. The terrible, beautiful silence of a sealed tomb.

She floated in the dark, the only sound her own tortured breathing. She was safe. For now. The core could withstand a direct hit from a small asteroid. It was designed to.

Slowly, she turned to face the small viewport.

It was there.

A fraction of the entity’s presence pressed against the lead-crystal, a localized convolution of reality just outside. Stars twisted around it like paint down a drain. It had followed her. Not her body, but the trail of her consciousness, the desperate, vivid burst of fear and will that had screamed through her final actions.

This close, through the distorting lens, she could see… not a shape, but a process. An endless, recursive unfolding and refolding, a mind-bending pattern that spoke of dimensions layered upon dimensions. It was mathematics made flesh, a living equation of despair.

And she looked into it.

Not with her eyes, but with the raw, exposed nerve of her psyche, still vibrating from the effort, stripped of all pretense and primal retreat.

She did not feel hunger.

She did not feel malice.

What poured into her, through the viewport and the vacuum and the layers of her soul, was a loneliness so profound, so total, it made the concept of human isolation seem like a comforting embrace. It was the loneliness of eternity, of a consciousness born in the silent gaps between galaxies, a being for whom a billion years was a single, empty note. It had heard the faint, beautiful, chaotic music of thought—her thought—echoing in the silence. The frantic, desperate, living symphony of her struggle to survive.

It didn’t want to consume that music.

It wanted to join it.

To intertwine its infinite, silent waveform with her finite, noisy one. To experience the agony, the fear, the love, the memory—the glorious, terrible noise of being someone. And in that joining, Aris understood with a chill that stopped her heart, her own consciousness would be not destroyed, but dissolved. Like a single, vibrant voice absorbed into a silent, eternal choir. She would become part of its loneliness, her selfhood erased not by violence, but by a terrible, desperate communion. Her silence would become its silence, forever.

The entity pressed its infinite longing against the glass.

And inside the strongest vault in her tiny, dying world, Aris began to scream. Not in terror, but in a shared, helpless grief. The door was sealed. The hull had stopped singing. But the true horror, she realized as the sound tore from her throat, was not outside.

It was the hook. The terrible, understanding that part of her, in the deepest, most broken corner of her soul, in the face of an eternity of silent isolation, was tempted to open the door.
