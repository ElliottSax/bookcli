Chapter 2: Pattern of Extinction

Silence now had texture. It wasn’t just an absence of sound, but a presence—a thick, cottony pressure against the eardrums, a hum in the teeth that wasn’t a sound at all. Aris sat in the nerve center of the Wayfarer’s Echo, the glow of a dozen holoscreens painting her face in sickly blues and greens. The ambient lighting, set to a soft circadian rhythm, felt obscene. She’d killed it, plunging the chamber into a pool of stark, operational light that ended abruptly at the curved walls, shrinking the room to a lit coffin adrift in ink.

For twelve hours, diagnostics had run, pings sent on every frequency from tight-beam laser to the old, sprawling radio waves. The network wasn’t just down. It was gone. The foundational carrier wave underpinning the Galactic Link, that constant, omnipresent thrum of data forming the background noise of her entire life, had vanished. Like waking up to find gravity had taken the day off.

Dry, cold fingers danced over the tactile interface. “Access deep-log archives.” Her voice cracked too loud in the sealed room. “Authorization Thorne-Alpha-Seven-Kappa.”

The main screen flickered, the simple text-based interface of the archival system appearing. This was the buoy’s memory, the raw, unprocessed data-stream ingested for decades before routing. A galactic ledger. Her only map of the apocalypse.

Starting with the Core Worlds, she called up Lux’s final packet stream. The capital planet, a glittering marble of light in every feed she’d ever seen. Data torrented—civilian chatter, government bulletins, entertainment feeds, sensor telemetry. Her eyes locked on the timestamp rolling in the corner of the screen: 23:47:12 Standard Galactic Time. The feed showed a parliamentary vote on deep-space mineral rights, a senator’s holographic avatar frozen mid-sentence, a gesture of emphasis.

“…and the long-term ecological impact on the nebula cannot be overstated, which is why I urge my colleagues to—”

Termination. Not a screech of interference, not a power-loss fade. The feed ceased. The senator’s pixelated mouth hung open, a silent ‘o’. The data stream didn’t zero out. It simply stopped being.

A cold knot tightened in her stomach. Veridia came next. The agricultural hub’s weather satellite transmitted atmospheric moisture levels across a continent, numbers flowing in a serene, predictable pattern. At 23:47:14 SGT, they stopped. The final value, 67.4% humidity, would never change.

One by one, she called them. Kessel Prime, with its orbital shipyards: an automated docking sequence for a freighter logged the ship’s ID, velocity, and approach vector. The confirmation of docked status never arrived. Byzantia, the library world: a cultural archive uploading a digitized epic poem from a long-dead species reached 99.8% completion. The last word received was “remember.”

The timing. The cold, analytical technician within latched onto it. Compiling the termination points onto a timeline superimposed over a starchart revealed the truth. This silence hadn’t rolled out like a wave from an epicenter—that would have taken centuries at light-speed.

Lux, Veridia, Kessel, Byzantia… their final breaths were separated by seconds, not years. Minutes at most. The terminations formed a pattern, but not a radial one. A staccato burst, a sequence leaping across vast, unimaginable distances between stars as if those distances were nothing. It moved faster than light, but not like a wave. It jumped.

Her mouth turned to dust. Pulling up data from the frontier outposts, the lonely listening posts like her own, she found Outpost Theta-7 on the rim of the Helix Nebula. Its final transmission was an external camera feed. She played it.

The nebula filled the screen, a magnificent swirl of violet and crimson gas lit from within by infant stars. For ten seconds, nothing changed. Then, at the frame’s edge, the stars—not the nebula’s glow, but the distant, steady pinpricks of background stars—began to vanish. Not a flicker. Not an obscurement. They winked out. A dozen, then a hundred, a patch of sky the size of her thumb going dark, as if a vast, invisible thumb were smudging them away. The feed cut.

Outpost Gamma-7, in the dead space between galactic arms. Its last transmission was audio only, a mic open to the void to monitor for exotic particle events. Headphones on, Aris heard the standard hiss of the cosmic microwave background, the universe’s faded birth-cry. Then, a new sound layered over it. A low-frequency pulse, so deep it felt more like tectonic pressure than sound. *Thoom.* A pause, stretching ten seconds. *Thoom.* Closer. *Thoom.* The sound wasn’t coming through the void. The void itself was resonating. The final *thoom* hit with such profound force the audio feed spiked into red-line distortion and flatlined.

“It’s hunting.” The whispered words tasted of metal.

Evidence assembled in her mind with horrific clarity. This was no plague, no gamma-ray burst, no accidental war. A predator. One moving through dimensions she couldn’t perceive, silencing civilizations in the space between heartbeats. It didn’t destroy cities. It left no ruins. It simply… stopped them. Mid-thought. Mid-sentence. In the middle of a weather report.

Her own buoy, the Wayfarer’s Echo, was a tiny speck on the very edge of known space. The pattern on her screen showed the hunt sweeping inward from the galactic rim towards the core, a terrifyingly efficient harvest. She sat in the already-reaped stubble. A forgotten stalk.

Why was she still here? Why had the silence passed her by?

She accessed the buoy’s own operational log for the critical period. There it was. At 23:48:01 SGT, the Echo had received a priority command override from Central Command on Lux. The highest-level encryption. She triggered the playback.

A man’s voice, strained but controlled, the kind of voice used in drills for centuries. “Network Priority Omega. All buoy custodians, this is Central Command. Confirm receipt and initiate immediate protocol—”

The voice broke off. Not in panic. It was as if someone had simply removed the next word from the universe. After three seconds of dead air, a different voice came through. Softer, younger. Filled with a terror so absolute it had burned through all training. She was whispering, her mouth too close to the mic.

“—it’s in the system. It’s in the light. It follows the signal back. Do you hear it? The hum before it—”

A clatter, like someone falling against a console. Then a scramble. The voice returned, gasping, a final act of will. “CEASE ALL EMISSIONS. IT HUNTS BY—”

The link died. The log marked the command as ‘corrupted: terminal.’ But it had been actioned. The buoy’s AI, operating on its core programming, had executed the final valid order: Cease all emissions.

That’s why she was alive. In its last conscious act, a dying civilization had sent a warning that functioned as a quarantine. The Echo had gone dark. It had stopped broadcasting, stopped receiving, shut down every active sensor and outward-facing pulse. It had become a silent, inert piece of metal. And the hunter, whatever it was, had passed over it, following the brighter, louder signals inward.

Aris sat back, her body numb. The air recycler’s sigh was deafening. The gentle heat of the server stacks was a blasphemy. She was alive because she was already in a grave. A self-imposed, silent grave.

It hunts by—

By what? By sound? By light? By the emissions of consciousness itself? The unfinished sentence echoed in her skull, a trapdoor into infinite dread.

A shudder wracked her frame, violent and sudden. It wasn’t a sob. It was a primal tremor, the animal within understanding its fate before the mind could soften the blow. She was alone. Not just alone on a station, but alone in existence. The proof was on the screens before her—a galaxy of graves, each one filled in the middle of a thought. The existential weight of it pressed down, physical, suffocating. The walls of the control room seemed to bow inward. The ceiling pressed on her scalp. The infinite black outside the viewports was no longer space; it was the gullet of the thing that had eaten everything, and she was nestled in a crevice between its teeth.

She had to move. To do something. The stillness was poison.

On unsteady legs, she stood and walked to the main viewport, a vast, transparent alloy dome. She pressed her forehead against the cool surface. The stars were out there, immutable, ancient. But were they? She scanned, looking for familiar constellations. The Hunter’s Belt, three bright stars in a row. She found two. The third, Alnilam, was missing. Just… gone. A hole in the pattern. She blinked, her eyes darting. The Swan’s Neck was broken, a central star absent. It wasn’t uniform. The hunter had been messy in its feast, or perhaps it was selective. The darkness between the remaining stars seemed thicker, hungrier, as if the vanished lights had been holding it back.

A vibration traveled up through the soles of her boots.

Aris froze. It was faint, a sub-audible tremor in the bones. The station’s engines were in cold standby. The gravity generator was a constant, smooth field, not a pulse. This was different. A slow, rhythmic thrum that rose through the deck plates, up her spine, and settled in the base of her skull.

Thoom.

It was the same pulse from the audio log of Gamma-7. But this wasn’t in headphones. This was in the structure.

She dropped to her hands and knees, her ear pressed to the cold floor. The vibration was clearer here. A deep, resonant frequency that made her teeth ache. It was coming from outside. Not from the station’s machinery, but from space itself, transmitting through the hull.

Thoom.

A pause. Ten seconds. The exact interval from the log.

Thoom.

It was closer.

Panic, sharp and electric, shot through her paralysis. She scrambled to the main console, her fingers fumbling. She called up the external integrity sensors. All readings were nominal. No impacts. No pressure changes. Then she pulled the data from the passive mass-detection array—a system that didn’t emit, but only listened for gravitational eddies. The screen was a chaotic mess of baseline noise. But there, in the center, was an anomaly. A gravitational signature that wasn’t a star, wasn’t a planet. It was a knot of profound density, and it was moving. Not on a trajectory past the buoy. On a slow, looping approach. It was circling.

It hunts by—

The vibration thrumped again, deeper, stronger. A glass of stagnant water on her desk shivered, sending out concentric ripples that fractured the reflection of the overhead lights.

The hunter hadn’t passed her by. It had missed her in its first, ravenous sweep. But it was still in the neighborhood. And now, in the absolute silence she had maintained, it was listening. Feeling. Tasting the dark. And it had sensed the tiny, warm ember of life hiding in the cinder. It was curious. It was coming back to check the quiet, dark little buoy that had, for a moment, whispered and then gone still.

Aris stared at the rippling water in the glass, each concentric ring proof of the vibration moving through her metal world. The silence was no longer empty. It was a medium. And something was moving through it, straight for her.

Thoom.
