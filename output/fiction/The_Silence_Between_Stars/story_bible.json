      "description": "A woman in her mid-30s, psychologically resilient but worn by solitude. Deeply familiar with every scratch and sound of her ship. She is a listener by profession and nature, which becomes her curse.",
      "arc": "From finding solace in her silent, routine duty, to discovering a terrifying cosmic entity, to a desperate, failed attempt to communicate/connect, ending in her consciousness being dissolved and repurposed as bait."

      "role": "Memory / Psychological Anchor",
      "description": "A figure from Aris's past, remembered on a sun-drenched beach. Represents human connection, warmth, sensory richness, and emotional 'noise.' Exists only in Aris's memories and dreams.",
      "arc": "Serves as the symbol of what Aris is losing and what the entity cannot comprehend. Her memory is the last thing Aris clings to before her dissolution."

      "name": "The Entity",
      "role": "Antagonist / Cosmic Horror",
      "description": "A vast, non-corporeal intelligence native to the interstellar medium. It perceives the universe through resonance and seeks absolute, curated silence. It views sentient thought\u2014especially human mental 'noise'\u2014as a painful, chaotic impurity to be cleansed.",
      "arc": "From a distant, curious observer of Aris's signal, to an active hunter, to being tricked by the echo of Aris's erased consciousness. Its motivation shifts from purification to hunting a perceived mimic, an aberration in its silent order."

  "narrative_voice": "Close third-person, focused almost exclusively on Aris's perspective and sensory experience. Clinical and detailed when describing the ship's environment; lyrical and strained when delving into memory, perception, and psychological terror.",
  "tone": "Dread-filled, claustrophobic, and intellectually terrifying. Begins with melancholic isolation, builds to paranoid suspense, and culminates in a cold, cosmic irony. The horror is less about visceral violence and more about existential unmaking and predatory indifference.",
  "plot_summary": "Aris Thorne maintains a solitary comms buoy, the *Wayfarer's Echo*, in deep space. She begins to detect a strange, resonant 'silence' within the Galactic Link\u2014a void that absorbs signals. She realizes this silence is a vast, predatory entity that hunts sentient thought. Attempts to warn others fail as the entity isolates her. In a final, desperate act, she broadcasts the raw noise of her own consciousness and memories, trying to communicate. The entity, repelled by the chaos but fascinated, doesn't communicate back\u2014it *erases* her. However, her final broadcast leaves a recursive echo of the entity's own resonance. Mistaking this echo for a mimic, the entity abandons its interest in the now-extinguished human, turning instead to hunt its own ghost, leaving Aris's sacrifice as nothing but a forgotten piece of bait in an endless, incomprehensible cosmic game.",
