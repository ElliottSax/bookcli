 le shift, a fractal ripple in the wrongness. But it was enough. The entity had noticed her.

Aris Thorne’s breath came in short, sharp bursts. She had been careful, so careful. But the suit was a light, a tiny, bright spark of life in the dark. The entity had been listening for a symphony, and she had just played a single, discordant note.

The distortion began to expand, to pulse with a new, hungry rhythm. It was no longer content to listen. It was reaching.

Aris Thorne kicked harder, propelling herself into the corridor. The core was ahead, a dark sphere in the center of the buoy’s skeletal spine. It was her last refuge, her last chance. If she could reach it, if she could seal herself inside, she might survive.

But the entity was faster. The distortion outside the buoy began to writhe, to twist in on itself. It was forming a tendril, a filament of wrongness that reached out, out, towards the tear in the hull.

Aris Thorne watched, frozen, as the tendril entered the buoy. It was a thing of shifting geometry, a fractal nightmare that defied the laws of physics. It moved with a slow, deliberate grace, winding its way through the corridors, towards her.

She backed away, her suit jets firing in short, desperate bursts. The tendril followed, unhurried, inevitable. It was a predator, and she was prey.

Aris Thorne’s mind raced. She had to do something, anything, to stop it. But what? She was unarmed, untrained. She was just a scientist, a researcher. She wasn’t a soldier, a warrior. She was just a woman, lost in the dark.

The tendril reached out, its fractal edges brushing against her suit. She felt it, a cold, wrong pressure, like the touch of a dead thing. She recoiled, her breath coming in short, sharp gasps.

The tendril pulsed, a slow, rhythmic beat. It was communicating, trying to understand. It was curious, interested. It wanted to know what she was, what she was doing here.

Aris Thorne’s mind raced. She had to say something, anything, to distract it. She had to make it stop.

“Leave me alone,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the roar of her own breath. “Please, just leave me alone.”

The tendril pulsed again, this time with a sense of amusement. It was toying with her, playing with her. It was enjoying her fear.

Aris Thorne’s mind rebelled. She wouldn’t be a toy, a plaything. She was a person, a human being. She had a name, a life, a story. She was more than just a thing to be toyed with.

She reached out, her gloved hand brushing against the tendril. It was cold, wrong, but she didn’t pull away. She held on, her fingers curling around the fractal edges.

“You don’t understand,” she said, her voice steady, calm. “I’m not just a thing. I’m a person. I have a name. I have a life. I have a story.”

The tendril pulsed, a slow, rhythmic beat. It was listening, trying to understand. It was curious, interested. It wanted to know more.

Aris Thorne’s mind raced. She had to tell it, to explain. She had to make it understand.

“I’m Aris Thorne,” she said, her voice steady, calm. “I’m a scientist. I’m a researcher. I’m here to study the universe, to understand it. I’m here to learn, to discover. I’m here to live.”
