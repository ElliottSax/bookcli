      "ending_hook": "The correction is successful, but the new trajectory is a worse fate: a slow, years-long spiral directly into the dead star's accretion disk."

        "The act of suiting up, of moving through the shuddering corridors, is a symphony of thought and motion.",
        "She sees the entity's form outside: a fractal distortion of spacetime, drinking in the vibrations of her movement.",
        "She reaches the reinforced core, but the door mechanism is damaged, requiring frantic, physical effort to close."
      ],
      "ending_hook": "As the core door seals, she makes eye contact with the distortion outside the viewport. In her mind, she feels not hunger, but a terrible, infinite *loneliness* from the entity. It doesn't want to eat her thought; it wants to join with it, and in doing so, erase its silence."

        "She broadcasts one final, pure, open-ended data packet\u2014not a thought, but a recording of the entity's own resonant pattern\u2014back into the silent network, a warning and a weapon."
      ],
      "ending_hook": "The buoy crosses the event horizon of the dead star's influence. All signals cease. In the final moment, Aris achieves perfect stillness, her mind dissolving into the infinite, chaotic static, becoming just another vibration in the cosmic noise, finally invisible. The entity, bereft, turns toward the new vibration now echoing from the broadcast she left behind."
