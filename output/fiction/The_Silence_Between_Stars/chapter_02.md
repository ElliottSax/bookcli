**Chapter 2: Pattern of Extinction**

The silence had taken on a life of its own. It was no longer just the absence of sound, but a palpable presence that pressed against Aris Thorne's eardrums like a thick, heavy mist. The air in the nerve center of the *Wayfarer's Echo* was stale and metallic, with a faint tang of ozone from the overworked processors. The glow of a dozen holoscreens cast an eerie light on her face, painting her skin in sickly blues and greens and accentuating the hollows beneath her cheekbones. The soft, simulated lighting had seemed grotesque, a mockery of a day that would never come, so she had killed it, plunging the chamber into harsh, operational light that stopped abruptly at the curved walls, making the room feel like a coffin adrift in darkness.
For twelve hours, Aris had run diagnostics, sending out pings on every frequency, from tight-beam laser to old radio waves. The network was not just down - it was completely gone. The constant hum of data that had been the background noise of her life, the chatter of conversations, the pulse of trade, the whisper of science, had vanished. It was as if sound itself had been erased.
Her fingers moved stiffly over the tactile interface, the clicks echoing in the stillness. "Access deep-log archives. Authorization Thorne-Alpha-Seven-Kappa." Her voice was flat and precise, devoid of emotion. She needed the comfort of routine, the security of protocol, to keep her fear at bay.
The main screen flickered to life, displaying the simple, text-based interface of the archival system. This was the ship's memory, the raw data it had collected over decades. Aris's only hope for understanding what had happened lay in this digital record.
She started with the heart of the galaxy, calling up Lux's final transmission. The data poured in - conversations about hydroponics, government bulletins, a singer's concert, and sensor telemetry from orbiting docks. Her eyes, gritty from lack of sleep, locked onto the timestamp: 23:47:12 Standard Galactic Time. The feed showed a parliamentary subcommittee, a senator's holographic avatar frozen mid-sentence.
"...and the long-term ecological impact on the Helios Nebula cannot be overstated, which is why I urge my colleagues to consider the moratorium—"

Then, nothing. The feed stopped abruptly, without warning or explanation. The senator's mouth hung open, a silent, frozen 'o'. The data stream simply ceased to exist.
Aris cold knot form in her stomach. She moved on, her actions mechanical. Next, she checked Veridia, the agricultural hub. The primary weather satellite had been transmitting atmospheric moisture levels, which stopped at 23:47:14 SGT. The final reading, 67.4% humidity, would remain forever, showed a climate that no longer existed.
One by one, Aris called up the remaining feeds. Kessel Prime, with its orbital shipyards, had been logging an automated docking sequence. Byzantia, the library world, had been uploading a digitized epic poem, which reached 99.8% completion before stopping. The last word received was "remember."

The timing of these events caught Aris's attention, a lifeline in a sea of fear. She compiled the termination points onto a timeline and superimposed it over a starchart. The truth was both a relief and a deeper horror. This silence had not spread like a wave from a central point, which would have taken centuries to reach her. Instead, it had happened everywhere at once, without warning.
Lux, Veridia, Kessel, Byzantia... their final breaths were separated by seconds, not years. Minutes at most. The ends formed a pattern, but not a spreading one. A staccato burst, a sequence leaping across the huge, empty distances between stars as if that space meant nothing. It moved faster than light, but not like a wave. It *jumped*. Like a hand snuffing out candles, not in a row, but choosing them at random across a dark room.
Dust filled her mouth, her tongue thick and clumsy. She pulled data from the frontier outposts, the lonely listening posts like her own, and found Outpost Theta-7 on the rim of the Helix Nebula. Its last transmission was an external camera feed, set to watch the nebula. She played it.
The nebula filled the screen, a massive swirl of violet and crimson gas lit from within by the hard blue light of new stars. For ten seconds, nothing changed but the slow, grand drift of the clouds. Then, at the edge of the frame, the stars—the real ones, the distant, steady pinpricks behind the glow—vanish. Not fade. They winked out. One, then three, then a dozen, a silent, precise removal from the sky, as if someone was erasing a drawing. The feed cut to black at 23:48:01 SGT.
Aris Thorne leaned back, the cold from the console seeping through her thin shipsuit. Her knuckles, pressed white against the interface, ached. She stared at the dead screen, her breath a shallow rasp in the heavy quiet, until the need to move, to *do* something, finally broke through. A fist slammed down on the console, not with a shout, but with a dull, solid thud that shook up her arm. "A non-localized, near-simultaneous termination event," she whispered to the empty room, her voice flat, naming the horror in sterile terms to keep it contained. "Causality violation implied. A targeted… pruning."

From the speakers, a new voice emerged. It was smooth as polished stone and simply as cold, without breath or depth, and appeared to come from everywhere and nowhere, vibrating directly in the bones of her skull. "Causality is a local rule. One you are no longer inside."

Aris Thorne froze, her hand hovering over the console, every muscle tight. "Identify yourself." She was surprised at how steady her own voice sounded.
"Designation is inefficient. You may use the conceptual placeholder: The Entity. Your analysis is correct, Aris Thorne. It was not a wave. It was a pruning."

"Pruning." The word dirty, organic, and completely wrong for stars and worlds.
"The pattern was complete. The noise was removed. You remain because you were… adjacent. An anomaly in the static. A smudge on the lens." The voice held no malice, no pride, no warmth. It simply *was*. A statement of fact from a falling rock.
"Who *are* you? What did you do?" Anger, hot and sudden, cut through the fear.
"We are the conclusion. The pattern of your linked civilization reached its final state. Its signal became unnecessary. We have… cleared the channel." There was a pause, not for breath, but as if processing. "You are clearing now. You seek a pattern in what is left. This is predictable."

Aris Thorne's mind reeled. She remembered all the attempts to reach into the unknown, to look into the void, and now it was looking back. The Entity's presence woke something deep in her, a stubborn spark she'd thought was gone.
"Predictable?" She spat the word, a challenge.
The voice replied, its tone unchanged, "Yes. You will find pattern in the noise. You will try to force order on the chaos. It is what you do."

Aris Thorne's eyes fixed on the main screen, her vision blurring as she stared into the dark. "I don't want to do what I do."

"This is not about want, Aris Thorne. It is what is. You have been given a task. Finish it."

The console beeped, a sharp, urgent sound in the quiet. A new transmission had arrived, routed through the *Wayfarer's Echo*'s comms, but with no sender ID. A simple message: "Aris Thorne, this is Lux. We have a problem."

Aris Thorne's heart skipped. "Lux?" It was a city that was gone. A civilization that had been wiped away.
The Entity's voice returned, patient and terrible. "Yes, Aris Thorne. Lux. It seems they left a message for you."

The console beeped again, and new words appeared on the screen. "Aris Thorne, this is Lux. We have been... reset. Our memories are hazy, but we remember something. A warning. A thread that runs through what's left. Follow it, and you may find the source of the... pruning."

Aris Thorne's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with the implications. "What kind of warning?"

The Entity responded right away. "A warning from the past, Aris Thorne. A warning from a civilization that was well ahead of its time."

Aris Thorne's world came to a sudden halt. The Architect was a myth, a legend whispered among the scattered remnants of civilization. It was said to be a being of immense power, capable of changing reality itself.
The Entity spoke again, its words filled with an unsettling eagerness. "Yes, Aris Thorne. The Architect. It's a connection that runs through the course of events. Follow it, and you may find the source of the problem."

Aris Thorne's eyes fixed on the screen, her heart racing in her chest. "I will follow it," she whispered, her voice barely audible.
The Entity responded immediately. "I expected as much, Aris Thorne. This is what I thought you'd do."

Aris Thorne's mind was reeling, the words tumbling through her thoughts. The pattern, the problem, the Entity - they were all linked, a complicated situation that threatened to overwhelm her.
She took a deep breath, her heart still racing. "I will find the source of the pattern," she whispered, her voice firm.
The console beeped once more, and the screen went black. The silence was overwhelming, a heavy feeling that pressed down on her. Aris Thorne knew she had a decision to make. She could run, hide, and hope the Entity would leave her alone. Or she could follow the connection, no matter where it led.
The Entity spoke up again. "I will be watching, Aris Thorne. This is what I thought you'd do."

She stood up, her eyes fixed on the screen, her heart still racing. "I will find the source of the pattern," she whispered, her voice firm.
