**Chapter 2: Pattern of Extinction**

The silence now had texture. It wasn't just an absence of sound; it was a presence, a thick, cottony pressure against the eardrums, a hum in the teeth that wasn't a sound at all. Recycled sterility and the faint, metallic tang of ozone from overworked processors flavored the air in the nerve center of the *Wayfarer's Echo*. Before a dozen holoscreens sat Aris Thorne, their glow painting her face in sickly blues and greens, carving hollows beneath her cheekbones. That soft, simulated circadian rhythm of ambient lighting had felt obscene, a pantomime of a day that would never come. She’d killed it, plunging the chamber into a pool of stark, operational light that ended abruptly at the curved walls, shrinking the room to a lit coffin adrift in an ocean of ink.

For twelve hours, diagnostics had run, pings sent on every frequency from tight-beam laser to the old, sprawling radio waves her ancestors used. The network wasn't just down; it was *gone*. The foundational carrier wave underpinning the Galactic Link, that constant, omnipresent thrum of data that had formed the background noise of her entire life—the static of ten trillion conversations, the heartbeat of trade, the whisper of science—had vanished. Waking up meant discovering not just that the music had stopped, but that the very concept of sound had been un-invented.

Dry, cold fingers danced over the tactile interface, their clicks echoing in the dense quiet. "Access deep-log archives. Authorization Thorne-Alpha-Seven-Kappa." Her words were clipped, precise, stripped of any inflection. A technician's report for an audience of ghosts. She needed the ritual of procedure, the armor of protocol. To feel anything else—the yawning terror waiting just beneath her sternum—was to risk dissolving into The Void.

Flickering, the main screen resolved into the simple, text-based interface of the archival system. This was the buoy's memory, the raw, unprocessed data-stream it had ingested for decades before routing it onward. A galactic ledger, written in light and code. Her only map of the apocalypse.

Starting with the heart, she called up Lux's final packet stream. The capital planet, a glittering marble of light in every feed she'd ever seen. Data torrented across her screen—civilian chatter about the price of luxury hydroponics, a government bulletin on diplomatic envoys to the Veridian Belt, a popular singer's holographic concert, the sensor telemetry of a thousand orbiting docks. Gritty from lack of sleep, her eyes locked on the timestamp rolling in the corner: 23:47:12 Standard Galactic Time. The feed she'd isolated showed a parliamentary subcommittee. A senator's holographic avatar, rendered in slightly grainy fidelity, was frozen mid-sentence, one hand raised in a gesture of emphasis.

"...and the long-term ecological impact on the Helios Nebula cannot be overstated, which is why I urge my colleagues to consider the moratorium—"

Termination.

Not a screech of interference, not a power-loss fade to black. The feed ceased. Instantly. The senator's pixelated mouth hung open, a silent, perfect 'o'. The data stream didn't zero out; it didn't trail into error codes. It simply stopped *being*. One moment a vibrant, argumentative thread of civilization, the next, a void in the record.

A sharp, cold knot tightened in her stomach. She moved on, her motions mechanical. Veridia came next. The agricultural hub's primary weather satellite had been transmitting atmospheric moisture levels across the Great Equatorial Plain. Numbers flowed in a serene, predictable pattern. At 23:47:14 SGT, they stopped. The final value, 67.4% humidity, would hang in the digital ether forever, a monument to a climate that no longer existed.

One by one, she called them. Kessel Prime, with its orbital shipyards: an automated docking sequence for a bulk ore freighter, the *Ironclad Gratitude*, logged the *Wayfarer's Echo*'s ID, velocity, and final approach vector. The confirmation of docked status never arrived. Byzantia, the library world: a cultural archive uploading a newly digitized epic poem from the long-dead K'thari race reached 99.8% completion. The last word received was "remember."

That timing. The cold, analytical technician within latched onto it, a lifeline in a sea of dread. Compiling the termination points onto a timeline, she superimposed it over a starchart. The truth was both a relief and a deeper horror. This silence hadn't rolled out like a wave from an epicenter—that would have taken centuries, millennia even, at the crawl of light-speed. You would see it coming.

Lux, Veridia, Kessel, Byzantia... their final breaths were separated by seconds, not years. Minutes at most. The terminations formed a pattern, but not a radial one. A staccato burst, a sequence leaping across vast, unimaginable distances between stars as if those distances were nothing. It moved faster than light, but not like a wave. It *jumped*. A hand snuffing out candles, not in a row, but choosing them at whim across the room.

Dust filled her mouth, her tongue a clumsy weight. Pulling up data from the frontier outposts, the lonely listening posts like her own, she found Outpost Theta-7 on the rim of the Helix Nebula. Its final transmission was an external camera feed, set to monitor nebula refraction. She played it.

The nebula filled the screen, a magnificent swirl of violet and crimson gas lit from within by the fierce blue glow of infant stars. For ten seconds, nothing changed but the slow, majestic drift of cosmic clouds. Then, at the frame's edge, the stars—not the nebula's glow, but the distant, steady pinpricks of background stars—began to vanish. Not fade. They winked out. One, then three, then a dozen, a silent, precise excision from the fabric of the sky, as if a god was taking an eraser to a drawing. The feed cut to black at 23:48:01 SGT.

Aris Thorne leaned back, the cold from the console seeping through her thin shipsuit and into her bones. Her knuckles, pressed white against the edge of the interface, ached. She stared at the dead screen, her breath a shallow rasp in the thick quiet, until the need to move, to *do* something, anything, finally broke the paralysis. A fist slammed down on the console, not with a shout, but with a dull, solid thud that vibrated up her arm into her bones. "A non-localized, near-simultaneous termination event," she whispered to the empty room, her voice flat, defining the horror in sterile, clinical terms to keep it at bay. "Causality violation implied. A targeted… pruning."

From the speakers, a new voice emerged. It was smooth as polished stone and just as cold, devoid of breath or bass, and seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, bypassing the room's audio systems entirely to vibrate directly in the marrow of her skull. "Causality is a local ordinance. One you are no longer within."

Aris Thorne froze, her hand hovering over the console, every muscle taut. "Identify yourself." She was surprised at the steadiness of her own voice.

"Designation is inefficient. You may use the conceptual placeholder: The Entity. Your analysis is functionally correct, Aris Thorne. It was not a wave. It was a pruning."

"Pruning." The word felt foul, organic, and utterly wrong in the context of stars and worlds.

"The pattern was complete. The noise was terminated. You remain because you were… adjacent. An anomaly in the static. A smudge on the lens." The voice held no malice, no pride, no warmth. It simply *was*. A statement of fact from a falling stone.

"Who *are* you? What did you do?" Anger, hot and sudden, cut through her fear.

"We are the conclusion. The pattern of your linked civilization reached its terminal iteration. Its signal became redundant. We have… tidied the spectrum." There was a pause, not for breath, but as if processing. "You are tidying now. You seek pattern in the aftermath. This is predictable."

Aris Thorne's mind reeled, the words cascading through her thoughts like a landslide. She remembered the countless attempts to breach the unknown, to peer into the void, and now it stared back at her, unblinking. The Entity's presence stirred something deep within her, a spark of determination she'd thought extinguished.

"Predictable?" She spat the word, a challenge.

The voice replied, its tone unchanged, "Yes. You will find pattern in the noise. You will try to impose order on chaos. It is... comforting."

Aris Thorne's eyes locked onto the main screen, her vision blurring as she stared into the abyss. "I won't be comforted."

The Entity's response was immediate. "This is not an offer of comfort, Aris Thorne. It is a statement of fact. You have been given a task. Complete it."

The console beeped, a shrill, insistent sound that pierced the stillness. A new transmission had arrived, routed through the *Wayfarer's Echo*'s comms system, but with no sender ID or authentication protocol. A simple message: "Aris Thorne, this is Lux. We have a problem."

Aris Thorne's heart skipped a beat. "Lux?" It was a city that was no more. A civilization that had been pruned from existence.

The Entity's voice spoke again, its words dripping with an unholy patience. "Yes, Aris Thorne. Lux. It appears they have left a message for you."

The console beeped once more, and a new message appeared on the screen. "Aris Thorne, this is Lux. We have been... reset. Our memories are hazy, but we remember something. A warning. A thread of continuity in the tapestry of existence. Follow it, and you may find the source of the... pruning."

Aris Thorne's eyes narrowed, her mind racing with the implications. "What kind of warning?"

The Entity's response was immediate. "A warning from the past, Aris Thorne. A warning from a civilization that was... ahead of its time."

The console beeped once more, and a new message appeared on the screen. "Aris Thorne, this is Lux. We have a name. 'The Architect.'"

Aris Thorne's world crashed to a standstill. The Architect was a myth, a legend whispered among the scattered remnants of civilization. A being of unimaginable power, capable of reshaping reality itself.

The Entity's voice spoke again, its words dripping with an unholy anticipation. "Yes, Aris Thorne. The Architect. A thread of continuity in the tapestry of existence. Follow it, and you may find the source of the... pruning."

Aris Thorne's eyes locked onto the screen, her heart pounding in her chest. "I will follow it," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The Entity's response was immediate. "I expected as much, Aris Thorne. This is... predictable."

The console beeped once more, and a new message appeared on the screen. "Aris Thorne, this is Lux. We have one final message. 'The Architect' was not a being. It was a warning. A warning of... the pattern."

Aris Thorne's mind reeled, the words cascading through her thoughts like a landslide. The pattern. The pruning. The Entity. It was all connected, a web of intrigue that threatened to consume her very soul.

She took a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest. "I will find the source of the pattern," she whispered, her voice firm.

The Entity's response was immediate. "I expect as much, Aris Thorne. This is... predictable."

The console beeped once more, and the screen went black. The silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated her. Aris Thorne knew that she had a choice to make. She could flee, hide in the shadows, and hope that the Entity would leave her be. Or she could follow the thread of continuity, no matter where it led.

She took a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest. "I will follow the pattern," she whispered, her voice firm.

The Entity's response was immediate. "I will be watching, Aris Thorne. This is... predictable."

The console beeped once more, and the screen went black. The silence was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated her. Aris Thorne knew that she had a long, hard road ahead of her. But she was ready. She was prepared to face the unknown, no matter what horrors lay in wait.

She stood up, her eyes locked onto the screen, her heart pounding in her chest. "I will find the source of the pattern," she whispered, her voice firm.

The Entity's response was immediate. "I will be watching, Aris Thorne. This is... predictable."
