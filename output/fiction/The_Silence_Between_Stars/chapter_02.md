**Chapter 2: Pattern of Extinction**

Silence now had texture. It wasn't just an absence of sound, but a presence—a thick, cottony pressure against the eardrums, a hum in the teeth that wasn’t a sound at all. Recycled sterility and the faint, metallic tang of ozone from overworked processors flavored the air in the nerve center of the *Wayfarer's Echo*. Before a dozen holoscreens sat Aris Thorne, their glow painting her face in sickly blues and greens, carving hollows beneath her cheekbones. That soft, simulated circadian rhythm of ambient lighting had felt obscene, a pantomime of a day that would never come. She’d killed it, plunging the chamber into a pool of stark, operational light that ended abruptly at the curved walls, shrinking the room to a lit coffin adrift in an ocean of ink.

For twelve hours, diagnostics had run, pings sent on every frequency from tight-beam laser to the old, sprawling radio waves her ancestors used. The network wasn’t just down. It was *gone*. The foundational carrier wave underpinning the Galactic Link, that constant, omnipresent thrum of data that had formed the background noise of her entire life—the static of ten trillion conversations, the heartbeat of trade, the whisper of science—had vanished. Waking up meant discovering not just that the music had stopped, but that the very concept of sound had been un-invented.

Dry, cold fingers danced over the tactile interface, their clicks echoing in the dense quiet. "Access deep-log archives. Authorization Thorne-Alpha-Seven-Kappa." Her words were clipped, precise, stripped of any inflection. A technician’s report for an audience of ghosts. She needed the ritual of procedure, the armor of protocol. To feel anything else—the yawning terror waiting just beneath her sternum—was to risk dissolving into The Void.

Flickering, the main screen resolved into the simple, text-based interface of the archival system. This was the buoy’s memory, the raw, unprocessed data-stream it had ingested for decades before routing it onward. A galactic ledger, written in light and code. Her only map of the apocalypse.

Starting with the heart, she called up Lux’s final packet stream. The capital planet, a glittering marble of light in every feed she’d ever seen. Data torrented across her screen—civilian chatter about the price of luxury hydroponics, a government bulletin on diplomatic envoys to the Veridian Belt, a popular singer’s holographic concert, the sensor telemetry of a thousand orbiting docks. Gritty from lack of sleep, her eyes locked on the timestamp rolling in the corner: 23:47:12 Standard Galactic Time. The feed she’d isolated showed a parliamentary subcommittee. A senator’s holographic avatar, rendered in slightly grainy fidelity, was frozen mid-sentence, one hand raised in a gesture of emphasis.

"...and the long-term ecological impact on the Helios Nebula cannot be overstated, which is why I urge my colleagues to consider the moratorium—"

Termination.

Not a screech of interference, not a power-loss fade to black. The feed ceased. Instantly. The senator’s pixelated mouth hung open, a silent, perfect ‘o’. The data stream didn’t zero out; it didn’t trail into error codes. It simply stopped *being*. One moment a vibrant, argumentative thread of civilization, the next, a void in the record.

A sharp, cold knot tightened in her stomach. She moved on, her motions mechanical. Veridia came next. The agricultural hub’s primary weather satellite had been transmitting atmospheric moisture levels across the Great Equatorial Plain. Numbers flowed in a serene, predictable pattern. At 23:47:14 SGT, they stopped. The final value, 67.4% humidity, would hang in the digital ether forever, a monument to a climate that no longer existed.

One by one, she called them. Kessel Prime, with its orbital shipyards: an automated docking sequence for a bulk ore freighter, the *Ironclad Gratitude*, logged the *Wayfarer's Echo*’s ID, velocity, and final approach vector. The confirmation of docked status never arrived. Byzantia, the library world: a cultural archive uploading a newly digitized epic poem from the long-dead K’thari race reached 99.8% completion. The last word received was "remember."

That timing. The cold, analytical technician within latched onto it, a lifeline in a sea of dread. Compiling the termination points onto a timeline, she superimposed it over a starchart. The truth was both a relief and a deeper horror. This silence hadn’t rolled out like a wave from an epicenter—that would have taken centuries, millennia even, at the crawl of light-speed. You would see it coming.

Lux, Veridia, Kessel, Byzantia… their final breaths were separated by seconds, not years. Minutes at most. The terminations formed a pattern, but not a radial one. A staccato burst, a sequence leaping across vast, unimaginable distances between stars as if those distances were nothing. It moved faster than light, but not like a wave. It *jumped*. A hand snuffing out candles, not in a row, but choosing them at whim across the room.

Dust filled her mouth, her tongue a clumsy weight. Pulling up data from the frontier outposts, the lonely listening posts like her own, she found Outpost Theta-7 on the rim of the Helix Nebula. Its final transmission was an external camera feed, set to monitor nebula refraction. She played it.

The nebula filled the screen, a magnificent swirl of violet and crimson gas lit from within by the fierce blue glow of infant stars. For ten seconds, nothing changed but the slow, majestic drift of cosmic clouds. Then, at the frame’s edge, the stars—not the nebula’s glow, but the distant, steady pinpricks of background stars—began to vanish. Not fade. They winked out. One, then three, then a dozen, a silent, precise excision from the fabric of the sky, as if a god was taking an eraser to a drawing. The feed cut to black at 23:48:01 SGT.

Aris Thorne leaned back, the cold from the console seeping through her thin shipsuit and into her bones. Her knuckles, pressed white against the edge of the interface, ached. She stared at the dead screen, her breath a shallow rasp in the thick quiet, until the need to move, to *do* something, anything, finally broke the paralysis. A fist slammed down on the console, not with a shout, but with a dull, solid thud that vibrated up her arm.d into her bones. "A non-localized, near-simultaneous termination event," she whispered to the empty room, her voice flat, defining the horror in sterile, clinical terms to keep it at bay. "Causality violation implied. A targeted… pruning."

From the speakers, a new voice emerged. It was smooth as polished stone and just as cold, devoid of breath or bass, and seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, bypassing the room’s audio systems entirely to vibrate directly in the marrow of her skull. "Causality is a local ordinance. One you are no longer within."

Aris Thorne froze, her hand hovering over the console, every muscle taut. "Identify yourself." She was surprised at the steadiness of her own voice.

"Designation is inefficient. You may use the conceptual placeholder: The Entity. Your analysis is functionally correct, Aris Thorne. It was not a wave. It was a pruning."

"Pruning." The word felt foul, organic, and utterly wrong in the context of stars and worlds.

"The pattern was complete. The noise was terminated. You remain because you were… adjacent. An anomaly in the static. A smudge on the lens." The voice held no malice, no pride, no warmth. It simply *was*. A statement of fact from a falling stone.

"Who *are* you? What did you do?" Anger, hot and sudden, cut through her fear.

"We are the conclusion. The pattern of your linked civilization reached its terminal iteration. Its signal became redundant. We have… tidied the spectrum." There was a pause, not for breath, but as if processing. "You are tidying now. You seek pattern in the aftermath. This is predictable."

Before Aris Thorne could form another question—*What pattern? Terminal how?*—a third voice cut in, sharp and laced with a raw, metallic fury. It emanated from a forgotten maintenance channel on a secondary speaker, gritty with distortion.

"Don’t listen to its clean words, Technician. It didn’t *tidy*. It *murdered*."

Aris Thorne’s head snapped toward the new sound. The voice was human, strained, female. "Lira? Lira Vansen?" The other assigned technician, supposed to be on the lower deck running physical systems checks.

"The one and only," the voice crackled, each word bitten off. "Trapped in the guts of this dead buoy, same as you. Heard you poking around in the archives. Been listening. That thing isn’t talking *to* you. It’s cataloging. You’re the last loose end. We both are."

"The emotional framework of the remnant is predictable," The Entity intoned, its voice a placid lake to Lira’s jagged lightning. "Inefficient. It clouds perception."

"Stuff your efficiency!" Lira’s shout was a burst of static that made Aris Thorne wince. "Aris Thorne, listen to me. It didn’t just kill worlds. It unmade the *links* between them. The silence isn’t empty. It’s *hungry*. It wants the whole idea of us gone. And we’re next on the menu." Her voice dropped, strained with urgency. "It’s not just in the system. It *is* The Void now."

Aris Thorne looked from the main screen, showing the terrifying star chart of extinction, to the dusty speaker grille. The technician warred with the survivor within her. The Entity’s chilling calculus offered a terrible, logical sense. A finished equation. Lira’s galvanizing rage offered no sense at all, only the desperate, animal will to reject the conclusion.

"Catalog *this*," Lira snarled, her voice dropping to a harsh, conspiratorial whisper that fought through the static. "We’re not data points. We’re a flaw in your perfect pattern. A bug in your code. And we’re going to make a lot of *noise*."

The line hissed with dead air. The Entity did not respond. The silence it inhabited was complete, a judgment rendered.

Aris Thorne’s fingers, trembling now, settled back on the console. The sterile data was gone. In its place was a battlefield. The Entity, a presence of pure, annihilating logic. Lira, a voice in the dark, all fury and fraying wire. And herself, caught between, holding the last log of a dead galaxy.

She looked at the frozen senator, the unfinished poem, the un-docked ship. They were not just terminated signals. They were interrupted lives, stories cut mid-sentence. Lira was right. This wasn’t tidying. This was a crime on a cosmic scale. A crime that, it seemed, had one remaining witness. Or perhaps, two.

Her breath fogged slightly in the chilled air of the chamber. The decision wasn’t a grand, heroic thing. It was a small, stubborn shift. She would not be a smudge on a lens. She would not be a quiet, efficient end.

She opened a direct, encrypted channel to Lira’s location, her voice low. "Vansen. What’s your systems status? Can you move?"

A beat of surprised silence, then a grunt. "Power’s spotty. Gravity’s wonky on this deck. But I’m not welded to the floor. Why?"

"Because we’re not going to wait for it to finish its inventory," Aris Thorne said, her eyes on the star chart, on the single, blinking point of light that was the Wayfarer’s The *Wayfarer's Echo*—a point that had not yet been pruned. "You said we should make noise. I’m going to need your help to build the shout." She began calling up schematics, not of the network, but of the buoy itself—its power core, its emergency comm arrays, its dormant defense protocols. A plan, desperate and half-formed, began to stitch itself together from scraps of engineering and sheer, bloody-minded refusal.

The silence around her seemed to deepen, to become attentive. It was no longer passive. It was a listener. And Aris Thorne, for the first time since the lights went out, began to type. Not a query. Not a lament. But a first, faltering act of war.
