A low, insistent throb vibrated through the deck plates. Aris Thorne stiffened, her fingers hovering over the console. *This time, I won’t let it go.* The sound deepened, a pulse resonating in her bones. Not imagination. Not fatigue. Real.

Her palm slammed against the comms array, keys lighting up under her touch. Static and noise cascaded across the screen as it flickered to life. Adjusting the gain, she caught her breath—the hum resolved into a pattern, a rhythmic, stuttering pulse repeating every three seconds. A signal. A real, honest-to-God signal. Her pulse hammered in her throat, wild and erratic, matching the stutter on the screen.

A sharp, insistent beep cut through the static. Her fingers flew over the keys, heart pounding. The screen flickered again, the static resolving into a series of dots and dashes repeating in a steady rhythm. Morse code. The realization hit like a physical blow, the message's weight pressing down on her chest. She knew the pattern, drilled into memory during training. SOS. Save our souls.

A cry for help, a desperate plea from someone—or something—lost in The Void. Her fingers trembled, keying the response as her breath caught. *This is the Wayfarer’s Echo. Do you read me?* The words echoed into The Void, a fragile plea hanging in the air like a prayer.

Louder now, the hum became a deep, resonant throb filling the cabin. Deck plates vibrated under her feet, the sound a physical presence pressing down on her chest. Breath came in short, sharp gasps, her heart pounding in her ears. *It’s close. Whatever it is, it’s close.* A cold, hard truth she couldn’t ignore. No longer alone. The void had spoken, and it was calling her name.

Another beep from the comms array, the screen flickering with a new message. *This is the Wayfarer’s Echo. Do you read me?* A desperate plea from The Void. Trembling fingers keyed the same response, her breath hitching. *This is the Wayfarer’s Echo. Do you read me?* The words echoed again, fragile and desperate.

The hum swelled, a deep throb saturating the cabin. Vibration traveled up through the soles of her boots, the sound pressing inward. Short, sharp gasps. A pounding heart. *It’s close. Whatever it is, it’s close.* The cold truth settled deeper. She was no longer alone. The void had spoken, calling her name.

Again, the comms array beeped, the screen flickering. *This is the Wayfarer’s Echo. Do you read me?* The same desperate cry. Her trembling fingers repeated the response, breath catching. *This is the Wayfarer’s Echo. Do you read me?* The plea hung there, a whispered prayer.

Filling the cabin, the hum grew into a resonant throb. The deck plates trembled, the sound a tangible weight. Gasps sharpened. Her heart thundered. *It’s close. Whatever it is, it’s close.* An undeniable statement. Solitude had ended. The void had spoken her name.

Another beep. Another flicker. *This is the Wayfarer’s Echo. Do you read me?* The plea from the lost. A tremor in her hands as she keyed the reply, throat tight. *This is the Wayfarer’s Echo. Do you read me?* The echo lingered, fragile.

The hum crescendoed, a deep throb consuming the space. Vibrations climbed her legs, the pressure immense. Breath hitched. Blood roared in her ears. *It’s close. Whatever it is, it’s close.* The final, cold realization. Alone no more. The void had spoken, and it was calling her name.

Louder still, the deep, resonant throb filled the cabin. Deck plates vibrated under her feet, the sound a physical presence pressing down on her chest. Aris Thorne’s breath came in short, sharp gasps, her heart pounding in her ears. *It’s close. Whatever it is, it’s close.* The realization was a cold, hard truth she couldn’t ignore.
