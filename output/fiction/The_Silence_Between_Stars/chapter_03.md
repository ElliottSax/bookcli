The darkness of The Void surrounded Aris Thorne like a shroud, the only sound the soft hum of the Wayfarer's Echo's systems. The silence was oppressive, a heavy weight that pressed down on her shoulders. She'd grown accustomed to the isolation, but it still made her skin crawl. The endless expanse of nothingness stretched out before her like an abyss, waiting to swallow her whole.
Aris's eyes scanned the console, her fingers hovering over the keys. The silence was broken by a low, insistent throb that vibrated through the deck plates. She stiffened, her heart rate spiking. This time, I won't let it go. The sound deepened, a pulse resonating in her bones. Not imagination. Not fatigue. Real.
Her palm slammed against the comms array, keys lighting up under her touch. Static and noise cascaded across the screen as it flickered to life. Adjusting the gain, she caught her breath—the hum resolved into a pattern, a rhythmic, stuttering pulse repeating every three seconds. A signal. A real, honest-to-God signal. Her pulse hammered in her throat, wild and erratic, matching the stutter on the screen.
The smell of ozone and burning circuits wafted through the cabin, a familiar scent that filled her with a mix of excitement and trepidation. Aris's eyes narrowed as she worked the comms array, her fingers flying over the keys with a practiced ease. The static and noise resolve into a series of dots and dashes, repeating in a steady rhythm. Morse code. The realization hit like a physical blow, the message's weight pressing down on her chest.
SOS. Save our souls.
A cry for help, a desperate plea from someone—or something—lost in The Void. Her fingers trembled, keying the response as her breath caught. This is the Wayfarer's Echo. Do you read me? The words echoed into The Void, a fragile plea hanging in the air like a prayer.
Louder now, the hum became a deep, resonant throb filling the cabin. Deck plates vibrated under her feet, the sound a physical presence pressing down on her chest. Breath came in short, sharp gasps, her heart pounding in her ears. It's close. Whatever it is, it's close. A cold, hard truth she couldn't ignore. No longer alone. The void had spoken, and it was calling her name.
Aris's eyes darted around the cabin, as if searching for something to confirm the signal. The dim lighting cast eerie shadows on the walls, making her feel like she was trapped in a nightmare. She rubbed the fatigue from her eyes, the dryness a reminder of how long she'd been awake.
Another beep from the comms array, the screen flickering with a new message. Do you read me? A desperate plea from The Void. Trembling fingers keyed the same response, her breath hitching. Do you read me? The words echoed again, fragile and desperate.
The hum swelled, a deep throb saturating the cabin. Vibration traveled up through the soles of her boots, the sound pressing inward. Short, sharp gasps. A pounding heart. It's close. The cold truth settled deeper. She was no longer alone. The void had spoken, calling her name.
Aris's mind racing with possibilities, she worked the comms array with a renewed sense of purpose. Who was out there? What was their story? The questions swirled in her head like a maelstrom, drawing her in with an irresistible force.
Again, the comms array beeped, the screen flickering. Do you read me? The same desperate cry. Her trembling fingers repeated the response, breath catching. Do you read me? The plea hung there, a whispered prayer.
Filling the cabin, the hum grew into a resonant throb. The deck plates trembled, the sound a tangible weight. Gasps sharpened. Her heart thundered. It's close. An undeniable statement. Solitude had ended. The void had spoken her name.
Aris's eyes locked onto the screen, her fingers poised over the keys. She like she was staring into the abyss, the unknown staring back at her with cold, dead eyes. The silence between the beeps appeared to stretch out forever, the anticipation building to a crescendo.
Another beep. Another flicker. Do you read me? The plea from the lost. A tremor in her hands as she keyed the reply, throat tight. Do you read me? The echo lingered, fragile.
The hum crescendoed, a deep throb consuming the space. Vibrations climbed her legs, the pressure immense. Breath hitched. Blood roared in her ears. It's close. The final, cold realization. Alone no more.
Aris's world narrowed to the screen, the beeps, and the hum. The Voito be shrinking, the distance between her and the unknown closing with each passing moment. She like she was standing on the edge of a precipice, staring into the unknown with feelings of trepidation and wonder.
Louder still, the deep, resonant throb filled the cabin. Deck plates vibrated under her feet, the sound a physical presence pressing down on her chest. Aris Thorne's breath came in short, sharp gasps, her heart pounding in her ears. It's close. The realization was a cold, hard truth she couldn't ignore. She was no longer alone.

In the silence that followed, Aris like she was waiting for the other shoe to drop. The anticipation was almost palpable, the tension building to a breaking point. She knew that she was on the cusp of something momentous, something that would change the course of her life forever.
And then, the silence was broken. The comms array beeped once more, the screen flickering with a new message. Aris's heart skipped a beat as she read the words, her mind reeling with the implications.
