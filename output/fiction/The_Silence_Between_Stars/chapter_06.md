 The dream was a good one. It was the greenhouse on Ceres Station, the air thick with the loamy scent of soil and the sweet perfume of late-blooming Martian orchids. Her mother’s hands, real and calloused, were guiding her own, pressing a seed into the damp peat. “It’s not about forcing it,” her mother’s voice was a vibration through her back, a warm rumble against her spine. “It’s about listening to the quiet need inside it. The silence tells you everything.”

Then The Void changed.

It wasn’t the humid, fertile quiet of the greenhouse. It was the hollow, sucking silence of The Void, and it was straining. A low-frequency tremor, felt not through sound but through a sudden, nauseating torsion in the pit of her stomach. The greenhouse glass cracked, not with a sound, but with a spider-web pattern of wrongness that hurt her eyes. The orchids blackened and curled, not from heat, but from a sudden, profound absence of vibration. Her mother’s hands turned to dust.

Aris Thorne snapped into consciousness not with a gasp, but with a suffocating jolt of systemic overload. The hibernation pod didn’t hiss open; it violently ejected her, its gel-filled embrace becoming a viscous, rejecting fluid that shoved her into the icy, stale air of the buoy’s control coffin. Lights, a brutal, chemical white, seared her retinas. But worse than the light was the sound.

The alarm.

It wasn’t a klaxon. Klaxons were for fires, for breaches, for human-scale disasters. This was the buoy’s core distress frequency—a pulsing, subsonic thrum that vibrated the titanium deck plates, climbed the bones of her legs, and settled its teeth into the marrow of her jaw. It was a feeling of profound structural complaint, a single, sustained note of orbital decay. It was the sound of The Void, breaking.

“No,” she croaked, her voice a rusted hinge. Her body was a foreign object, a bag of chilled meat and brittle bones. Every movement was a negotiation with atrophy. She fumbled for the manual restraint release, her fingers numb sausages. “Nononono…”

The main console flickered to life, a ghost blooming in a dead room. Data cascaded across the central screen. Trajectory plots, gravitational vectors, mass-shadows. Her sleep-fogged brain, trained over a decade of deep-space piloting, parsed it before her conscious mind could catch up.

The buoy was off-course. Not by a random micrometer. Not by a gentle nudge.

Something with immense mass had passed by, close enough for its gravitational field to be a hand, brushing against the buoy’s momentum. It had plucked the delicate string of their orbit and given it a sickening twang. The path now was a lazy, lethal curve. A new, ugly line of red dashes on the nav-plot terminated not in the empty void, but in a dense, precise point labeled PSR J0348-0432b – a dead neutron star. A twenty-kilometer-wide tombstone of degenerate matter, spinning in silent oblivion.

And the buoy was drifting toward it. Not a headlong rush. A sedate, inexorable fall.

Panic was a live wire, dropped into the water of her nervous system. She convulsed with it, a full-body shudder. The entity. It did this. It touched us. It’s a gravitational predator, fishing with its mass.

The instinct was to scream, to flood the systems with power, to ignite the correction thrusters at full burn and claw her way back to the safety of the old, silent vector. But the memory of the probe was a fresh brand on her psyche. Power was perception. Light was a scream. A course correction would be a flare in the night, a ringing bell.

She had a choice: die quietly in the crushing grip of the dead star, or die loudly, torn apart by whatever listened in the dark.

Tears of frustration and terror welled in her eyes, blurring the deadly red line. She couldn’t die here. Not like this, a bug smeared on a cosmic windshield. The mission… The Void… it couldn’t end as a footnote in a gravity well.

“Minimal systems,” she whispered, the protocol a prayer. “Whisper. Just a whisper.”

Her hands, trembling, danced over the physical backups—touchscreens were too bright, too resonant. She powered only the navigation array and the cold-gas attitude thrusters, a child’s breath compared to the main engines. Each switch she threw, each circuit she closed, felt like a transgression. The low hum of the buoy’s central processor spinning up was a roar in the perfect church of her isolation. She flinched, waiting for the answer.

The console lights seemed to pulse in time with the alarm’s subsonic dread. She worked with robotic, single-minded focus, partitioning her mind. One section was all numbers: burn duration, vector angles, fuel-mass ratios. Another was a raw, animal nerve-ending, stretched out into The Void, feeling for the touch.

She initiated the correction burn. A series of tiny, precise puffs from the thrusters. The vibration was barely perceptible through the deck—a faint, metallic chattering, like teeth in a cold skull. On the plot, the red death-curve began to bend, slowly, agonizingly slowly, away from the neutron star’s immediate pull.

Come on. Come on.

She was a surgeon operating on herself in a dark room, trying to stitch a wound without looking. Every second of burn was a second of exposure. She imagined the entity out there, a shapeless leviathan of thought and vibration, turning its incomprehensible attention toward this tiny, buzzing mote. Was this how an ant felt, crossing the shadow of a boot?

The burn sequence completed. The thrusters fell silent. The alarm cut off.

The sudden cessation of the subsonic thrum was almost as shocking as its start. The silence rushed back in, but it was different now. It was a held breath. A listening silence.

Aris Thorne froze, her fingers still poised over the console. She didn’t blink. She barely breathed. Her own heartbeat was a timpani roll in her ears, a disgraceful noise. She was a mouse in a wall, praying the cat hadn’t heard the scuttling.

The seconds stretched. The buoy’s systems hummed, a quiet, mechanical heartbeat. The navigation plot showed the red line now curving away from the neutron star, but the margin was razor-thin. One wrong move, one miscalculation, and the buoy would still drift into the star’s event horizon.

She exhaled, slow and controlled, her breath fogging the cold air. The silence pressed in, heavier now, as if The Void itself was leaning in to listen. She could feel it, the weight of the entity’s attention, a pressure against her skin. It was watching. Waiting.

“You can’t have us,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Not yet.”

She reached for the manual override, her fingers trembling. The override was a last resort, a desperate gamble. It would flood the thrusters with fuel, ignite them in a single, brutal burst. It would be a scream in the dark, a flare that would burn bright and hot and fast.

But it would also be a light.

The entity would hear it. It would know.

Her fingers hovered over the switch. The silence seemed to deepen, as if The Void itself was holding its breath. She could feel the entity’s presence, a cold, heavy weight pressing against her mind. It was waiting. Watching.

She closed her eyes, her breath shallow and quick. The override was a risk. A gamble. But the alternative was worse. Drifting into the neutron star’s gravity well, being crushed into nothingness. She couldn’t let that happen.

She flipped the switch.

The thrusters ignited with a roar, a sudden, violent burst of light and heat. The buoy shuddered, the deck plates vibrating beneath her feet. The navigation plot showed the red line now arcing away from the neutron star, a desperate, last-minute escape.

But The Void was gone. The void was no longer empty. It was alive with the entity’s presence, a cold, heavy weight pressing against her mind. She could feel it, the entity’s attention, a cold, heavy hand on her shoulder.

“You can’t have us,” she whispered again, her voice barely audible. “Not yet.”

The entity’s presence seemed to intensify, a cold, heavy weight pressing against her mind. She could feel it, the entity’s attention, a cold, heavy hand on her shoulder. It was watching. Waiting.
