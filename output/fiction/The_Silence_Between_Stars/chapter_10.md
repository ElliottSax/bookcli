Chapter 10: Beneath the Conscious Mind

The silence was no longer empty. It had a presence that pressed against the buoy's hull, searching for a weakness. Aris Thorne lay in the med-bay, strapped to the diagnostic couch, her own breathing the only sound she could hear. The comm-system had fallen silent an hour ago, which was even more unsettling. The lack of noise meant the hunter was close, listening intently.
Her plan, a decoy mind filled with meaningless algorithms and random memories, seemed fragile. It was now active, broadcasting a signal into the void. It might buy her some time, but she needed to disappear completely. The thought of it was a harsh reality, a burden that weighed heavily on her chest. She could feel it, a dull pain that seeped into her bones.
The neuro-suppressants in the hypospray vial sparkled, labeled as Cerulex for extreme neural distress. The warnings were clear: total disconnection from her higher brain functions, a return to basic instincts, and possible permanent damage. It was a drastic measure. Aris's hand, slick with sweat, trembled as she loaded the vial. Her mind, filled with fear and panic, screamed at her to stop. But she had to quiet that voice. The phrase "I am not my thoughts" echoed in her mind, a mantra she'd repeated for what like an eternity. It was her only defense against the abyss of her own consciousness.
The fluorescent lights above the med-bay cast an eerie glow on the white walls. The air was thick with the smell of disinfectant and ozone, making her stomach turn. A wave of nausea washed over her, but the cold sensation of the hypo in her hand pushed it back.
"I am the thing that hears them," she whispered, the words feeling bitter. The sound of her own voice was a shock, a spark that ran through her body. She it in her fingertips, her toes, and her core. It was a familiar yet strange sensation, like a memory she'd never experienced.
The silence was crushing, a physical force that pressed against her skin. She could feel its weight, the pressure of the vacuum sucking the air out of the room. Her breathing was short and sharp, her heart pounding in her chest.
She pressed the hypo against her neck. The cold applicator was a shock, a sudden burst of fear, and then everything faded. Not into darkness, but into sensation.
First, the cold. It was everywhere, in the metal of the couch, the air, and her bones. She was cold, and the cold was a part of her. There was no separation. The sensation enveloped her, wrapping around her like a shroud.
Then, the light. The med-bay lights were no longer just illumination; they were a pressure on her eyes, a heavy weight. The red flash of a dormant alert panel was a rhythmic pulse behind her eyelids. The light was a physical force, pushing against her retinas.
Then, vibration. The buoy's life-support hummed, a vibration that traveled through the couch and into her ribs. The faint tremor of a malfunctioning filter was a gentle hum. These were not just sounds; they were sensations happening directly to her body.
Her thoughts dissolved. Memories disappeared. Her identity, her name – these were distant concepts, meaningless. She was a collection of raw sensations, floating in a shell of flesh and bone. Time lost all meaning. It became a single, endless moment of feeling.
And in this state, she perceive.
The entity had no shape, no form that a brain could grasp. Before, it had been a shadow, a distortion. Now, stripped of her mind’s need to interpret, Aris Thorne perceived it as a pattern. A pattern of absence. It was a perfect, hungry silence that moved through the higher layers of reality like a shark through water, sensing the tiny electrical splashes of consciousness. It wasn’t hunting for bodies. It was hunting for the noise minds made. The psychic static of fear, of planning, of memory—that was its beacon. Her decoy, a frantic digital shout, was a blazing bonfire in this silent sea. She pattern shift, its immense, starving attention locking onto that false signal with an intensity that made the very vibrations in her bones skip.
But she, the animal on the couch, was nothing. A still, cold stone. A closed system.
Her awareness, unclouded by thought, drifted further. The dead star ahead—Tycus, its name meaningless now—was not a ‘grave’ or a ‘destination.’ It was a massive, slow pulse of gravity. A deep, constant warp in the fabric of everything. And this warp… it muddled the pattern. It wasn’t a shield; it was like a dense fog to the entity’s perfect hearing. The all-consuming silence that was the hunter became slightly blurred, slightly smeared in the heavy, static space around the star. It was the only reason the buoy, with its shrieking decoy mind, hadn’t been pinpointed and consumed already. The star’s gravitational sigh was creating a tiny pocket of static in the hunter’s perfect perception.
This understanding was not a thought. It was a new sensation layered over the cold and the light: a faint, gravitational pull, and around it, the frustrated, hungry stirring of the pattern.
Then, the pressure changed.
The entity, fixated on the decoy flare but finding it an empty, unsatisfying shell—a shout with no screamer—grew agitated. The pattern of silencto press.
It started as a change in the vibration. The deep thrum of the buoy’s systems didn’t simply falter; it tightened. The sound climbed in pitch, minutely, a strain that was before it was heard. The metal of the hull, the conduits in the walls, the frame of the couch—all began stlow, harmonic tone. It was a sound both familiar and utterly alien. Aris it in her bones, a vibration that was calling to her, drawing her into the heart of the entity.
The air in the med-bay thickened. The fluorescent lights flickered, casting jagged shadows. The silence was no longer just an absence of sound; it was a presence, a force pushing against her skin.
Aris’s heart raced, a drumbeat matching the vibration. Her breath came in short gasps, her mind a scramble of fear. She was trapped in a world of raw sensation, where thought was useless.
And yet, in this state of non-being, she begal a connection to the entity. It was primal and terrifying, a pull drawing her toward the void.
The entity’s presence was a living thing, a force that pulsed with an energy both familiar and alien. It was calling to her, pulling her into the depths.
Aris herself being drawn toward it by an unseen force. She was a speck in the vastness of space, yet she linked to the entity in a way that was exhilarating and horrifying.
The silence was a presence now, a palpable force against her skin. It was calling her into the heart of the void.
In that moment, Aris knew she was not alone. The entity was with her, watching, waiting. It was pulling her into the abyss, calling her into the heart of the void.
The silence
