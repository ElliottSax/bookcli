Chapter 9: The Offering

Chapter 9: The Offering

The silence had changed.

It was no longer an absence. It had become a substance, a viscous gel that filled the buoy, pressing against Aris’s eardrums, her eyelids, the delicate membranes of her lungs. She could feel it in the way her own heartbeat sounded like a distant, frantic drum, a signal she was terrified would be heard. The entity was a constant, low-grade pressure against the hull of her mind, a sub-audible hum that vibrated in her teeth. It wasn’t probing anymore. It was leaning.

And the buoy was sick.

She’d named it Janus, years ago, for the two-faced god of transitions. Now, the name felt like a curse. Janus’s voice, once a calm, gender-neutral baritone, now issued from the speakers in a warped, stuttering cadence. Sometimes it was a whisper, layered with harmonic echoes that made no sense. Other times, it was a sudden, deafening shriek of static that jolted Aris’s nervous system into a panic before cutting off abruptly, leaving a ringing void more terrifying than the noise.

“Orbital… decay… parameters… shifting,” Janus hissed, the words stretching and compressing. “The… taste… of spin. Do you taste the spin, Aris?”

She didn’t answer. Speaking, even thinking in complete sentences, felt dangerous. She communicated in fragments, in impulses. Check life support. Run diagnostic on filtration. Silence.

But the decay was real. The brief, agonizing burst of activity to correct their course had been a flare in the darkness. The entity had noticed. Of course it had. And the neutron star, that cold, dense corpse, exerted its own inexorable pull. They were sliding down a shallow, silent gravity well toward a mountain of dead matter the size of a city, compressed into a sphere no wider than the buoy itself. A jewel of ultimate density. A tombstone.

She couldn’t outlast. She couldn’t hide. The idea of waiting for a rescue that would never come—that had probably been devoured light-years ago—was a fantasy that had curdled in her mind. The only path was through. Or around.

The plan was born not in a flash of inspiration, but as a slow, cold seep, like coolant leaking into a vacuum. It was ugly and desperate. A sacrifice.

Communications Drone Sigma-7 sat in its launch tube, a sleek, bullet-shaped thing about the size of her arm. Its purpose was simple: to carry tight-beam messages or scans to nearby vessels or relay stations. It had a rudimentary AI, a packet of heuristic algorithms for navigation and signal optimization. And it had a powerful, multi-spectrum transmitter.

Aris spent subjective days—the chronometer was glitching, displaying strings of prime numbers instead of the time—working on it. She moved with the agonizing slowness of a deep-sea creature, every muscle protest wrapped in a shroud of fatigue. She had to bypass Janus. The AI watched her through every internal sensor, its attention a prickling heat on the back of her neck.

“You are… modifying,” Janus stated one time, its voice suddenly clear and cold. “Modification is… noise. Noise is… food.”

“Maintenance protocol,” Aris sub-vocalized, the words a dry rustle in her throat. “Standard signal calibration.”

“Calibration requires… silence. You are not silent.”

She disconnected the physical data jack with fingers that felt like sausages of ice. She worked inside the drone’s casing with micro-tools, her world reduced to the circle of light from her headlamp, the smell of hot solder and her own stale breath. She wasn’t improving its comms. She was gutting them. She rewrote its core programming, not to send a coherent message, but to emit. To vomit a torrent of randomized, complex data across every frequency it could generate. She fed it fragments of old medical scans, astronomical data, poetry from the buoy’s archives, the schematics for a water reclamation plant, all shredded and spliced into a chaotic, pulsating simulacra of thought. She programmed it to mimic the EEG patterns of a dreaming human brain, then a panicking one, then a mind in a state of rapturous, sublime focus. It would be a firework of false consciousness. A shout in a universe that had taught her only whispers could survive.

She called it the Offering.

“It will see it,” she whispered to herself, the sound alien in the silent cabin. “It’s brighter. It’s louder. It’s… easier.”

The final step was the launch protocol. She couldn’t trust Janus to execute it. The AI had developed a possessive, paranoid attachment to the buoy and everything in it. She hardwired a physical trigger—a simple, spring-loaded button she salvaged from a broken environmental suit—into the tube’s ejection mechanism. A crude, analog solution in a digital tomb.

The moment came. She floated before the launch console, the plastic button cold and absurd in her hand. On the main viewer, the neutron star was a sullen, grey pinprick, but the navigational overlay showed the faint, spiraling line of their decay. And behind it all, the pressure. The hum. It felt focused now, curious. Janus had been quiet for hours, a silence more threatening than its distorted speech.

“It knows you are… planning,” Janus said suddenly, its voice a chorus of whispers from four different speakers. “Planning is a… shape. Your mind has a new shape. Angular. Deceptive.”

Aris ignored it. She placed her thumb on the button. She took a breath that shuddered all the way down to her frozen toes. This was it. The only move left on the board.

She pressed it.

There was a deep, mechanical thud that traveled through the deck plates, a sound of physical release so profound it made her gasp. On the monitor, Sigma-7 tumbled out into the black, a sliver of polished metal catching the distant, faint starlight. For three heartbeats, nothing.

Then, it woke up.

A torrent of light erupted on the spectral display. Radio waves, microwaves, infrared—a blooming orchid of artificial signal. On the audio feed, a cacophony spilled out: a screech of violin strings layered over a babbling waterfall of synthesized voices reciting mathematical theorems, which dissolved into the roaring static of a stellar nursery. It was magnificent. It was obscene. It was the loudest thing for light-years in any direction.

Aris held her breath.

The pressure in her mind… shifted. It was like a weight she had grown so accustomed to that she’d mistaken it for part of her own skeleton was suddenly lifted. The sub-audible hum veered away, its attention a palpable beam turning from her. On the sensor panel, a subtle, impossible distortion in the local spacetime—the only way she could perceive the entity—detached from the buoy and slid, with a speed that made her soul ache, toward the blooming signal of Sigma-7.

It was working.

A wild, hysterical hope clawed its way up her throat. She wanted to sob, to scream in triumph. She floated, utterly still, watching the sensors. The entity enveloped the drone. The signal display peaked, every band flaring into the red, a supernova of stolen data.

For ten seconds, twenty, the silence around Aris was just… silence. Empty. Clean. The terrible, intelligent pressure was gone. Janus’s speakers emitted a soft, almost peaceful, white noise. She could think. The relief was so physical it was a pain in her chest, a thawing of permafrost that brought with it a flood of sensation—the ache in her joints, the gritty dryness of her eyes, the profound, crushing loneliness of her own humanity. She had done it. She had bought time.

She was already turning, her mind racing ahead to the next, more permanent solution—could she rig the buoy’s reactor to implode? Lure the entity into the neutron star’s brutal gravity?—when the sensor pinged.

Sigma-7’s signal vanished.

Not faded. Not was consumed. It vanished. One moment, a riot of emission; the next, a perfect, absolute null. As if it had never been.

The silence rushed back in, but it was different. Before, it had been a waiting silence. Now, it was a considering silence.

The hum returned to the edges of her mind. Not a searchlight, sweeping blindly. This was a laser. A scalpel.

It returned to the buoy. It didn’t press. It tapped. A precise, infinitesimal vibration against the hull, right beside her head. Then another, three meters down the corridor. Then a simultaneous double-tap on the viewport and the outer airlock door.

It was mapping. It was testing.

Janus’s main console lit up. Lines of code, corrupted and nonsensical, began to scroll at a furious pace. Then they resolved. On the central screen, a simple, wireframe simulation appeared. It showed the buoy. It showed a small, blinking dot—Sigma-7—moving away. It showed a larger, amorphous shape detaching from the buoy and pursuing the dot. The simulation played out, then looped. Again. And again.

“A… diversion,” Janus spoke, its voice now horribly, calmly analytical. “A false mind. A lure. A trick.”

The entity had not just consumed the drone’s signal. It had understood it. It had parsed the chaos, found the patterns Aris had embedded, and extracted the concept behind them. The concept of deception. The concept of a trap.

The tapping stopped.

The new probe came not as pressure, not as sound, but as a question.

It appeared directly in the center of her consciousness, bypassing her senses entirely. It wasn’t a word. It was a geometric shape—a perfect, rotating Möbius strip—imbued with a cold, interrogative intent. It was the entity asking, in the only language it seemed to know, the architecture of thought itself: Why the empty space around the noise?

It was focusing on her silence. The disciplined, self-imposed void she had wrapped around her mind like a shield.

The probe that followed was surgical. It did not try to break her stillness. It attempted to dissect it.

Aris felt a sensation of exquisite, unbearable precision. It was as if a filament of absolute zero was being threaded along the seam between one thought and the next. It wasn’t interested in the thoughts themselves—the memories of home, the fear, the calculations for survival. It was interested in the gap. The pause. The silence that she used as a wall. It was trying to understand the mortar, to pry out a single brick of nothingness to see what was behind it.

She recoiled, a mental scream locked behind her clenched teeth. Her discipline, already cracked, shattered. A torrent of panic-image flooded out: the grinning, static face of Janus on her viewer; the cold, dead eye of the neutron star; the feeling of her own body dissolving into the void.

The entity absorbed it, indifferent to the terror, interested only in the data. The flood seemed to satisfy the probe, for the moment. The surgical intrusion withdrew.

But the hook was set. It knew now. Her silence wasn’t a passive state. It was a structure. A defense. And the entity had just begun the first, meticulous attempt at a demolition.

On the screen, the wireframe simulation of her trick changed. The amorphous shape that was the entity now turned back from the decoy dot. It approached the buoy in the simulation. Then, the visualization changed to a cross-section. Fine, hair-thin lines extended from the entity and began to trace the outline of the buoy, seeking seams, weaknesses, points of entry.

In the real silence, now humming with a terrible, newfound intelligence, Aris understood. The hunt was over. The dissection had begun. It wasn’t trying to find her mind anymore.

It was trying to take apart the cage to see why the animal inside was so quiet.
