t straps.
Lena had said to move. To follow the red line.
He forced himself to his feet, swaying like a drunkard. The world tilted, then steadied. He took a step. His legs buckled, but he caught himself on the edge of a pod. The metal was cold under his palm, the surface slick with condensation.
Another step. Then another. He was walking. The pain was a constant, a fire that burned from his feet to his skull, but he was walking.
The red line was a thin, glowing snake on the floor, leading toward a set of double doors marked with a glowing exit sign. He followed it, his bare feet slapping against the cold floor. The sound was obscene in the silence.
He reached the doors. They were heavy, metal, with a push-bar release. He braced himself, then shoved. They swung open with a groan, revealing a dimly lit corridor beyond.
He stepped through, into the unknown.
Behind him, the alarms continued to wail. The facility was waking up. He had to move faster.
He stumbled down the corridor, his body screaming in protest. The red line led him to a junction, then down another hallway. He passed a series of doors, each marked with a number. He didn’t know where he was going, but he knew he had to keep moving.
He rounded a corner and saw a figure standing at the end of the hallway. It was Lena. She was holding a small device in her hand, her eyes wide with fear.
“Aris,” she whispered. “You made it.”

He nodded, his breath coming in ragged gasps. “Where now?”

“This way,” she said, leading him down another hallway. “We have to get to the service hub. It’s our only way out.”

He followed her, his body aching with every step. The facility was coming alive around them, the sound of footsteps and shouts echoing through the corridors.
They reached the service hub, a small room filled with machinery and cables. Lena pulled open a panel, revealing a ladder leading down into darkness.
“Go,” she replied. “I’ll cover you.”

He hesitated, then climbed down the ladder, disappearing into the darkness. Lena followed, sealing the panel behind her.
They were in a narrow, dimly lit tunnel. The air was damp and musty, the walls slick with condensation. They moved quickly, their footsteps echoing in the confined space.
“Where does this lead?” Aris asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
“To the old maintenance tunnels,” Lena replied. “They’re not on any of the facility’s maps. We should be safe there.”

They continued down the tunnel, the sound of their breathing the only noise in the silence. The air grew colder, the walls more damp.
a loud noise echoed through the tunnel. Lena froze, her eyes wide with fear.
“What was that?” Aris asked, his voice tense.
“I don’t know,” Lena replied, her voice barely above a whisper. “But we need to keep moving.”

They reached a junction, the tunnel splitting into two. Lena hesitated, then pointed to the left.
“This way,” she said, her voice firm. “We need to keep moving.”

They turned left, the tunnel growing darker and narrower. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and rusted metal.
They reached a dead end, a solid metal door blocking their path. Lena pulled out a tiny device, pressing a button. The door slid open with a hiss, revealing a dark, cavernous space beyond.
“This is it,” Le answered, her voice barely above a whisper. “The old maintenance tunnels. We should be safe here.”

They stepped through the door, the darkness enveloping them. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and rusted metal.
Lena pulled out a small flashlight, the beam cutting through the darkness. They moved quickly, their footsteps echoing in the silence.
