 t, focusing instead on the flexi-paper. The message was simple, a single string of numbers and letters: 03:47. 12-7-19. 3rd floor. Waste extraction.

The numbers were a code, a time and place. The date was a red flag, a warning. December 7, 1941. The day the old world’s Pacific Fleet was ambushed at Pearl Harbor. A date burned into history as the beginning of a war that reshaped the planet. Lena was telling him that the plan had been compromised, that the timeline was now a battleground.

The waste extraction corridor was a blind spot in the facility’s surveillance, a dead zone where the automated systems were designed to avoid interference. It was also a choke point, a narrow service tunnel where the pod’s climate systems vented excess heat and the facility’s waste was transported to the incinerators. The numbers 12-7-19 were a countdown, a warning that the facility’s security protocols would be on high alert, that the plan had to be executed before the system’s defenses were fully engaged.

Aris’s mind raced, piecing together the fragments of information. The waste extraction corridor was a logical choice for an escape route, a place where the facility’s automated systems would be less likely to detect an intrusion. But the date was a warning, a sign that the facility’s security protocols were already on high alert. The plan had to be executed before the system’s defenses were fully engaged.

The next six hours were an exercise in exquisite torture. The schematic was a taunt, a map to a door he couldn’t reach. He returned to his foot, his tiny, hard-won beachhead. Toe. Arch. Heel. He attempted a slow, agonizing curl of the entire foot, imagining the sole pressing against cool river stone. A muscle in his calf fibrillated, a useless, disconnected shudder. He ignored it, focusing instead on the flexi-paper. The message was simple, a single string of numbers and letters: 03:47. 12-7-19. 3rd floor. Waste extraction.
