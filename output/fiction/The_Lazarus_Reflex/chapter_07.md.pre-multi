Chapter 7: Pulse and Fury

Chapter 7: Pulse and Fury

The silence was a tomb. Aris existed within it, a mind pinned to a dissecting board of his own flesh. He had stretched his consciousness, filament by agonizing filament, down the length of his deadened spine, to the sole of his right foot. The effort had left him hollow, a bell that had been struck too hard and now only held the memory of sound. He held the position—a faint, ghostly awareness of pressure against the pod’s padding—like a man holding his breath at the bottom of the sea.

Then, a new pressure. Not his own. Fingers, gentle, adjusting the sensor on his ankle. Lena’s fingers.

Through the slit of his unblinking eye, he saw her face, a pale moon in the sterile gloom of the pod’s interior. Her brow was furrowed not with clinical focus, but with a desperate, searching intensity. She leaned close, her whisper a thread of sound in the hum of the machines.

“Aris,” she breathed, the name itself a rebellion. “If you can hear me… if you understand… twitch your foot. Once.”

The command was a mountain. To move was to betray the exquisite, painful stillness he had cultivated for weeks. To move was to risk the neural calibrator, the searing probes, the final, permanent upload. But to not move was to remain entombed forever. He gathered the scattered sparks of his will, focused them through the narrow conduit of control he had forged, and pushed.

A tremor. A faint, pathetic scrape of his heel against the sheet.

He saw her breath catch. Her eyes widened, glistening. She leaned closer, her scent cutting through the antiseptic—soap and a hint of jasmine, achingly human.

“Oh, God,” she whispered. “Okay. Okay. They’re coming. Kael’s team. They’re scheduling the final extraction for tomorrow.” Her words came in a frantic rush. “There’s no more time. I have a… a tool. An EMP emitter. Short-range. It’ll kill the power in this wing for maybe ninety seconds. Monitors, locks, the pod restraints—everything. It’s your only chance. But you have to be ready. When the lights go out, you move. Do you understand?”

Another monumental effort. The scrape of his heel. Yes.

“I’ll trigger it from the nursing station. When you’re out… head left. Follow the red exit line on the floor. It leads to a service hub. I’ll find you there.” Her hand squeezed his ankle, a bolt of real, unmediated sensation that was almost painful. “Don’t trust anyone. Don’t stop.”

She was gone, the pod’s lid sealing with a soft hiss-thunk, plunging him back into the silent horror of full immersion. Ninety seconds. A lifetime and an eye-blink. He began the internal work, the mental rehearsals his neurosurgical mind excelled at. Sequence: Restraints release. Respiratory tube extraction. Primary IV line. Cardiac monitors. Move. He catalogued the agony each action would bring, visualized the weak, atrophied muscles firing, the shock of cold air on skin perpetually bathed in controlled warmth.

Time became granular. Each second was a grain of sand he had to climb. The hum of the pod was the sound of his own blood. The gentle puff of the ventilator was the tide of a dead sea. He waited, a coiled spring made of nerve endings and prayer.

It began with a sound—a high-pitched, rising whine that seemed to originate in the fillings of his teeth. The lights in the pod’s bio-readout panel didn’t just go out; they shattered into darkness, the diodes dying with tiny, audible pops. The hum ceased so completely the silence was a physical blow.

Then came the fury.

Every machine attached to him gave a final, discordant shriek. The pod lid shuddered and released with a clunk that was not hydraulic, but mechanical. The restraints over his chest, wrists, and ankles snapped open.

Feeling returned not as a gentle tide, but as a tsunami of fire.

It roared up from his feet, a conflagration of pins and needles magnified a thousandfold—the scream of a billion nerves waking into raw, abraded life. His back arched involuntarily, a silent scream locked in his throat. The tube in his windpipe became a scaly, choking invader. His eyes, dry and unblinking for weeks, burned with tears.

Move.

The command cut through the neurological storm. He brought a hand up—a foreign, heavy object—and clawed at his face. His fingers, clumsy and numb, found the plastic hose taped to his cheek. He pulled. The world dissolved into white-hot panic as his airway was blocked, then cleared with a horrific, wet gag. He flung the vile thing aside, dragging in a shuddering, ragged breath that scraped like sandpaper. The air was cold. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever felt.

He ripped at the IV lines taped to his arms, the central line in his chest. A spray of blood, warm and shockingly real, painted the white interior of the pod. Alarms were blaring now, a distant, chorus of wails from deeper in the facility, battery-backed and furious.

He rolled to his side, every muscle protesting, and tumbled out of the pod.

The floor was ice-cold linoleum. He hit it with a bone-jarring thud, the impact singing through his atrophied frame. For a moment, he just lay there, breathing, feeling the solid, unyielding plane beneath him. He was out. He was on the floor. He was a bag of broken glass and willpower.

Pushing up on trembling arms, he rose to his knees. The Elysium Ward was a landscape of eerie, green-tinged darkness, illuminated only by the weak emergency strips along the floor. The silence was deeper now, absent the omnipresent machine-hum. It was filled instead with the sound of his own ragged breathing, and the soft, desperate thumps coming from the other pods.

He turned his head.

Rows of them, gleaming like sarcophagi in the gloom. Inside each, a face. The woman with the auburn hair. The young man who looked like a athlete. The elderly gentleman. Their eyes were open now, not staring vacantly, but rolling in panic, blinking against the sudden darkness. Mouths moved behind respiratory tubes. Fingers twitched against restraint straps. They were all in there. All awake. All trapped in the dying machines.

The horror of it was a cold knife in his gut. He wasn’t in a hospital. He was in a warehouse of souls.

Aris staggered to his feet, using the pod for support. His legs were water, his balance shot. He was a newborn fawn in the body of a forty-two-year-old neurosurgeon. Left. Follow the red line. He spotted it on the floor, a luminous stripe leading into the deeper darkness of the corridor.

He lurched forward, one shuffling step, then another. Each movement was a symphony of pain—the burn of atrophied muscles, the shriek of joints, the raw, abraded feeling of skin that hadn’t known friction in months. He passed pod after pod. A hand, pale and slender, slapped weakly against the interior glass. He met the wide, terrified eyes of a girl who couldn’t have been more than twenty. He couldn’t stop. If he stopped, he died. They all died.

He stumbled into the corridor. The emergency lights cast long, dancing shadows. The distant alarms were louder here, joined by the sound of running feet and shouted, muffled orders. The lockdown had begun.

He followed the red line, a thread of Ariadne in this sterile labyrinth. It led him past closed doors marked with incomprehensible codes, past carts of unused medical supplies. He rounded a corner and collided with a figure.

A yelp. A clatter of a tablet hitting the floor. It was a technician, young, with a wispy goatee and glasses, his white coat too big for him. He stared at Aris, at the blood soaking his gown, at the wild, sunken eyes in a gaunt face.

“Patient Seven?” the technician breathed, confusion overriding alarm. “How did you… the systems are down. You shouldn’t be…”

Aris didn’t have the breath for words. He lunged, not with strength, but with the sheer, desperate momentum of a falling tree. They crashed into the wall. Aris’s hands found the technician’s coat, gripping with pathetic weakness, but the fear behind them was potent.

“The server,” Aris rasped, his voice a stranger’s, rough from disuse and the trauma of the tube. “The central control. For the pods. Where?”

The technician struggled, but Aris was a nightmare sprung to life from his own machinery, a ghost made flesh. “I—I can’t!”

Aris slammed him against the wall again, a hollow thud. “They’re awake in there. All of them. Where is it?”

Something in Aris’s face—the clinical fury, the absolute, bone-deep conviction—broke the man. He whimpered. “C-Central Core. Sub-level three. Behind the biocontainment seal. But you can’t! The codes, the security—”

The thunder of booted feet echoed from a connecting corridor. Close.

Aris released him. The technician slid down the wall, scrambling away on his hands and knees. Aris turned, his mind clinging to the information. Sub-level three. Biocontainment.

A hand shot out from an open doorway, grabbing his arm, pulling him in. He was too weak to resist. The door hissed shut behind him.

Darkness. The smell of antiseptic and clean linen. A small, cramped space. Storage shelves lined with boxes of catheters, gauze, saline bags.

“Quiet,” Lena’s voice was in his ear, her body pressed against him in the confined dark. He could feel her trembling. Or perhaps it was him.

Outside, the running feet arrived. Halted. The beam of a powerful flashlight sliced under the door.

“Check in here,” a gruff voice ordered.

The door handle rattled. Lena’s breath stopped. Aris’s whole world narrowed to the thin line of light under the door. He saw the shadows of boots.

“Locked. Supply code override. Probably just auto-sealed on the lockdown.”

“Move on. Sweep and clear. Primary focus: the Elysium subjects. Dr. Kael wants them secured.”

The feet moved away. The light faded. In the thick, suffocating silence of the supply closet, Lena let out a shuddering gasp. She fumbled, and a small penlight clicked on, its beam a tiny, intimate sun.

She shone it on him and her face crumpled. “Oh, Aris.”

He looked down at himself in the stark light. He was a specter. His patient gown was stained with blood and betadine. His ribs and collarbones stood out in sharp relief under skin that was pale, almost translucent. Tracks of old IV lines and fresh, bloody tears from his frantic removal dotted his arms and chest. He was shaking uncontrollably, the adrenaline leaching away, leaving only wreckage.

“We can’t stay here,” she whispered, her professional composure gone, replaced by a raw, shared terror. “They’ll do a secondary sweep. And when they find your pod empty…”

“The server,” he croaked. “Central Core. Sub-level three.”

Her eyes widened. “That’s the heart of the project. That’s where they compile the neural maps. It’s a fortress.”

“It’s the only way to stop them. To free the others.” He leaned heavily against a shelf, the metal cool against his back. “You knew. All this time. You knew what they were doing.”

She looked away, the penlight beam dancing over boxes of gloves. “I suspected. I saw the brain scans. The patterns weren’t of vegetative states. They were of… containment. I just didn’t know how to prove it. Or who to tell.” She looked back at him, her eyes fierce. “Until you started screaming with your heart rate.”

A faint, grim smile touched his cracked lips. It felt alien on his face. “Need water.”

She grabbed a sealed bottle of sterile water from a shelf, cracked it open, and handed it to him. He drank, the water so cold and clean it was painful. It was ambrosia.

“We need a way down,” he said, his mind, the one tool that hadn’t atrophied, beginning to work. “Service elevators. Maintenance ducts.”

“The lockdown will have sealed the main shafts. But there’s an old pneumatic tube system for lab samples. It runs vertically through the sub-levels. The access panels are manual override in case of power failure.” She chewed her lip. “It’ll be a tight fit. And a long drop.”

“Better than a pod.”

She nodded, a decision solidifying. “This corridor leads to the old lab wing. It’s less patrolled. Come on.”

She cracked the door. The corridor was empty, bathed in the hellish, pulsating glow of a rotating emergency light. They moved, Aris leaning on her, his steps a little firmer now, the water and purpose lending a ghost of strength. He was a puppet cut from his strings, learning to stand.

They reached a junction. On the wall was a small, functional security monitor, still active on a separate power circuit. It showed a grid of views from around the facility. Lena went to move past, but Aris froze, his eyes locked on the feed from what looked like a central security station.

Dr. Alistair Kael stood in the center of the room, his usual calm replaced by a contained, volcanic fury. He was not in a lab coat, but in tactical black. A sleek, matte-black pistol was holstered at his hip. His voice crackled from the monitor’s tinny speaker.

“...empty. The EMP was an inside job. Find the therapist, Lena Voss. She is now a primary target.” He leaned into the camera, his handsome face a mask of chilling intent. “Lockdown Protocol Aegis is now in effect. Secure the viable neural subjects for immediate transfer to the secondary site. As for the Elysium wing itself…” He paused, his eyes cold as deep space. “Initiate terminal sanitization. Purge the environment. I want it sterile in thirty minutes. No evidence. No witnesses.”

The screen switched to a schematic of the Elysium wing. Sections began flashing red, one by one. Vents sealed. Doors locked with finality. A toxic, yellow gas icon appeared, flooding the corridors.

Lena made a small, choked sound.

Aris stared at the screen, the cold precision of the order seeping into his bones. This wasn’t just a cover-up. It was a scorched-earth policy. Sterile. They were going to gas the ward. They were going to murder every conscious soul in those pods, and then erase the crime scene.

On the monitor, Kael turned, his hand resting on the butt of his pistol, his gaze sweeping the room as if he could sense them watching. As if he were looking right at them.

The feed went dead.

In the sudden, profound silence of the abandoned corridor, the only sound was the frantic, accelerating pulse thrumming in Aris’s own ears, a furious drumbeat against the coming silence.
