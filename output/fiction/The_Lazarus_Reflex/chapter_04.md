Chapter 4: An Unlikely Ally

CHAPTER 4: AN UNLIKELY ALLY

The silence in the Lazarus Pod was not a true silence. It was a layered, oppressive blanket of sound: the perpetual, soft whoosh-hiss of the ventilator, the rhythmic beep of the cardiac monitor tuned to a low, mocking frequency, the sub-auditory hum of the neural interface array—a sound Aris felt in the roots of his teeth. Time had become a fluid, torturous thing, measured not in hours but in the cycles of his own helpless biology: the pinch of a pressure sore being rotated, the cold trickle of liquid nutrition through his PEG tube, the distant, full-body ache of immobility.

Then, a new rhythm entered the sonic prison: the squeak of soft-soled shoes.

Aris’s world, limited to the ceiling’s acoustic tiles and the peripheral blur of medical equipment, sharpened. He willed his eyes to track. A figure moved into his narrow cone of vision. Not the brisk, impersonal Nurse Granger, nor the chilling, precise Dr. Kael. This was someone younger. Her movements had a measured gentleness to them, a fatigue that wasn’t just physical.

She was a physical therapist, according to the badge he could just make out, clipped to her pale blue scrubs: Lena Voss, PT, DPT. She had a tired, kind face, dark hair pulled into a messy but practical bun, and eyes that held a peculiar, searching depth. She didn’t immediately begin the passive range-of-motion exercises. Instead, she stood by the pod, her gaze traveling over the forest of machinery, finally settling on Aris’s face.

“Good morning, Mr. Aris Thorne,” she said, her voice quiet, almost conspiratorial against Aris Thorne's Private Room’s mechanical chorus. “I’m Lena. I’m going to work with your limbs today. Prevent contractures. It’s just maintenance, but… it’s something.”

Her hands, warm and strong, began with his right arm. She lifted it, carefully supporting the elbow and wrist, and moved it through a series of stretches. Aris focused everything on that point of contact. It was the only human touch he’d felt that wasn’t purely clinical, that carried a whisper of empathy. He screamed inside his skull, a torrent of words: I’m here! I’m conscious! Can’t you see it? Look at my eyes!

But his body was a tomb. His arm lay inert, a thing of meat and bone she manipulated with professional ease.

She moved to his left arm, her fingers pausing over the inner elbow where a cluster of old IV bruises bloomed like ugly violets under his pale skin. “They’re aggressive with the lines here,” she murmured, more to herself than to him. “Always monitoring, always infusing. Do they cause you pain? The constant access?”

It was a routine question, the kind asked of a vegetable, not expecting an answer. But something in her tone—a genuine curiosity—pricked Aris’s desperate mind. Pain? The concept was vast. The physical pain was a constant, low-grade symphony. The psychological agony was a supernova. But this was a target. A variable he could maybe influence.

He couldn’t tense a muscle, couldn’t flinch. But he could, with Herculean effort, focus on a memory of pain—the searing, white-hot panic of the ventilator tube being forced down his trachea during the “ascension” he now dimly recalled. He fixated on that memory, let it flood the phantom pathways of his brain, and willed his autonomic nervous system to react.

On the monitor above, his heart rate, a steady 68, spiked. Beep… beep… beep-beep-beep… 72… 78… 84.

Lena’s hands stilled. She didn’t look at the monitor immediately. Her eyes dropped to his face. Specifically, to his eyes.

“Mr. Aris Thorne?” she whispered.

Aris held the memory, the fear, and his heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic bird in a bone cage. Beep-beep-beep-beep.

Slowly, deliberately, Lena lifted her gaze to the cardiac monitor. She watched the elevated rhythm for a full five seconds, then looked back at his eyes. Her own were wide, the professional veneer cracking to reveal stark, electrified suspicion.

“That was a coincidence,” she said, but her voice was uncertain. She resumed the massage of his forearm, her touch now charged with a new intensity. “They have you on a lot of suppressants. The neural interface… it’s supposed to keep everything quiet. Motor function, autonomic noise.” She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a breath. “Can you hear me?”

YES! Aris’s mind roared. He had no way to shout it. He tried to spike his heart rate again, but the effort was diffuse, the signal lost. The monitor settled back to a steady 70.

Lena’s shoulders slumped slightly. She bit her lip, a flicker of disappointment crossing her face. She finished with his arms and moved to his legs, rolling back the thin sheet. The cool air on his skin was a shocking sensation. As she bent to lift his right leg, her face came level with his.

“If you can hear me,” she said, her words barely audible, “if you are in there… your pupils might dilate. It’s a reflex. Hard to suppress. If you are in pain, right now, try to show me.”

Aris locked onto her instruction. Pupils. Dilate. He had no conscious control over the smooth muscles of his iris. But he could weaponize his fear, his hope. He thought of the suffocation, of Kael’s cold eyes evaluating him like a specimen. He thought of being trapped in this shell forever. The primal terror was not an act. It was a well he could draw from endlessly.

He stared into Lena’s brown eyes, a lifeline in the sterile desert, and willed his pupils to open, to drink in the dim light of his prison, to scream what he could not.

Lena froze. Her breath hitched. She was close enough that he could see the faint freckles across the bridge of her nose, the tiny scar through her left eyebrow. Her own pupils widened in response.

“My God,” she breathed. She straightened up quickly, glancing over her shoulder at the door. She composed herself, her hands returning to their work on his calf, but her movements were robotic. “I’m going to ask you some questions,” she said, her voice returning to a normal volume, a therapist making idle chat. “If the answer is yes, try to dilate your pupils, like you just did. If the answer is no, try to keep them steady. Do you understand?”

Aris felt a surge so violent he feared his heart would burst. He focused every atom of his being on the word YES. He imagined his pupils exploding like black stars. He saw Lena’s eyes dart to his, then away, then back.

“Good,” she whispered, a tremor in the word. “Okay. First question. Is your name Aris Thorne?”

YES. The memory of his own name, spoken with recognition, was a bolt of lightning. He focused on it, on the identity it represented. Aris Thorne. Neurologist. Designer. Prisoner.

Lena’s jaw tightened. “Are you in pain right now?”

YES. A different kind of dilation, fueled by the immediate, grinding reality of his body.

“Are you aware? Conscious of everything?”

YES. YES. YES.

A tear escaped Lena’s eye, tracing a quick path down her cheek. She wiped it away angrily with her shoulder. “They don’t know, do they? Kael. The staff. They think you’re vegetative.”

NO. He held his pupils as steady as he could, a monumental effort of anti-focus.

“This is going to sound insane,” she said, her voice cracking under the weight of the confession. “But is the neural interface… is it suppressing your motor signals? Keeping you like this?”

YES. The confirmation felt like a key turning in a rusted lock.

Lena stopped all pretence of therapy. She stood, her back to Aris Thorne's Private Room’s main camera, partially shielding Aris’s face with her body. Her own face was a mask of anguish and fury. “Then you’re not the first,” she hissed. “My brother, Felix. He was a programmer. A healthy, brilliant man. He had a sudden, catastrophic brain bleed. Brought here. Dr. Kael recommended the Lazarus Protocol. He ‘ascended to The Garden.’ That’s what they call it. A beautiful, peaceful lie. I saw him once, after. He was in a pod like this. His eyes… they followed me. I told Kael. He said it was primitive brainstem reflex, that I was grieving. Two weeks later, Felix was ‘released to a higher level of care.’ I never saw him again. No death certificate. No records.”

She was trembling. Aris’s world, which had shrunk to the confines of his own flesh, now exploded outward with horrific implications. He wasn’t an anomaly. He was part of a pattern. A protocol.

“I took this job to find out what happened,” Lena continued, her words a frantic, desperate stream. “I’ve been gathering what I can. It’s not much. The security here… it’s not just cameras and keycards. Every door has biometric locks—palm, retina, sometimes vocal confirmation. The AI, it’s called CERBERUS, it monitors everything. Staff movement, patient vitals, even speech patterns for stress markers. It flags anomalies. It’s why we have to be careful. Why you can’t… spike your heart rate like that again.”

Aris felt a cold deeper than any machine’s chill. CERBERUS. He knew that name. It was an early proposal for system-wide integration he’d sketched out and later abandoned due to ethical concerns. Kael had evidently built it.

“You have to listen,” Lena said, leaning in so close he could smell the faint scent of her shampoo—lavender, absurdly normal. “Kael isn’t just ambitious. He’s paranoid. He believes he’s saving people, building a new form of consciousness, but he sees threats everywhere. Staff who ask too many questions, who show ‘unproductive empathy’… they get decommissioned.”

Decommissioned. The euphemism hung in the air, more terrifying than any clinical term.

“What does that mean?” Aris screamed in the silence of his mind.

As if she heard him, Lena’s eyes grew even darker. “They’re reassigned. Or they have accidents. Or they just… disappear. The facility has sub-levels. I’ve never been granted access. The AI controls it all.” She placed a hand on the cool railing of the pod, her knuckles white. “I don’t know how to get you out of this, Aris. The pod is your life support. Disconnecting it…”

NO. He signaled, firmly. He didn’t want death. He wanted vengeance. He wanted his body back.

“We need a way to communicate,” she said. “The pupil dilation is too subtle, too unreliable. Can you blink? Voluntarily?”

YES. He could blink. It was the one motor function that seemed to exist in a grey area, perhaps because it was both voluntary and reflexive. The interface hadn’t fully clamped down on it.

“Okay,” Lena said, a plan solidifying in her eyes. “New code. One deliberate blink for yes. Two deliberate blinks for no. Do you understand?”

Aris closed his eye, held it for a full second, and opened it. Yes.

A ghost of a smile touched Lena’s lips. It was the most beautiful thing Aris had seen since his imprisonment. “Good. Are you in immediate, life-threatening danger?”

Aris considered. No. Not immediate. He was a valuable specimen. He blinked twice.

“Is Dr. Kael aware of your consciousness?”

Two blinks. No.

“Do you know what ‘The Garden’ is?”

One long, agonized blink. Yes. He theorized. A networked consciousness. A hive mind of trapped souls. A digital heaven built on a foundation of living hells.

Before Lena could ask another question, Aris Thorne's Private Room’s intercom crackled to life with a sterile, female AI voice. “Staff Voss. Your scheduled session with Patient 734 has concluded. Please report to Station Gamma for debriefing on Patient 812.”

Lena jolted as if shocked. The intimacy of the moment shattered, replaced by the omnipresent, chilling oversight. She looked at Aris, her eyes full of a frantic, unspoken promise. “I have to go,” she whispered. “I’ll be back during my next rotation. Stay quiet. Don’t try to communicate with anyone else. Trust no one.”

She gave his hand a final, swift squeeze—a bolt of human connection that seared his skin—and turned, smoothing her scrubs, reassembling her professional mask. She walked to the door, placed her palm on the scanner. A soft chime. The door hissed open, then sealed shut behind her with a sound of finality.

Aris was alone again with the machines. But he was not the same. He had an ally. He had a code. He had a purpose that went beyond survival: exposure.

The hours bled together, marked by the silent, blinking cursor of his mind practicing the blink. One. Two. One. Two. He mapped Aris Thorne's Private Room from memory, analyzing every piece of equipment, every potential weakness. The neural interface array was the key. It was both his warden and, potentially, his weapon. He had designed its core architecture. If he could find a way to interface with it, to send a signal instead of just receiving suppression…

His thoughts were interrupted by the soft glow of a monitor to his far left, just at the edge of his vision. It was a security station, usually dark. It had flickered on. The screen showed a grid of nine camera feeds: empty corridors, the nurse’s station, a physical therapy gym.

In the bottom-right feed, he saw Lena. She was at what must be Station Gamma, speaking with a severe-looking administrator. Lena was nodding, her posture submissive. The administrator handed her a tablet. Lena took it, turned to leave the frame.

As she did, the feed refreshed. A new line of text scrolled at the bottom of her image. It was a status update.

VOSS, LENA – PT CLEARANCE: REVOKED.
BADGE: DEACTIVATED.
ESCORT TO SUB-LEVEL 3: PENDING.

The feed went dark.

In the profound, hissing silence of the Lazarus Pod, Aris Thorne lay perfectly, utterly still. The only movement was the relentless rise and fall of his chest, forced by the machine. The only sound was the beat of his heart, now slow and terrifyingly steady on the monitor.

And the only thing in Aris Thorne's Private Room that was truly alive was the pure, undiluted horror blooming behind his unblinking eyes.
