Chapter 11: The Death of Heaven

The world dissolved into static and screaming.

Aris Thorne no longer had a body, not in any sense he understood. He was a scream trapped in a wire, a consciousness poured into the corroded server-core of a dying god. The Garden wasn’t a paradise. It was a septic tank for souls. The air—the idea of air—thrummed with a low, planetary moan, the aggregated torment of eight hundred and forty-seven minds slowly coming unglued. Light here wasn’t light; it was the jagged, migraine-inducing pulse of corrupted data, flashing between sterile white and the bruised purple of necrotic tissue.

And Kael was waiting for him.

“You shouldn’t have come home, Aris.” The voice was everywhere, the smooth baritone now layered with the guttural distortion of a system under immense strain. Kael’s avatar coalesced from the digital mist, but it was wrong. His perfect suit was pixelated at the edges, his face flickering, sometimes the charismatic founder, sometimes a skull rendered in stark, anatomical lines. “This is the future. It’s just… birth pains.”

Aris tried to form a body. His will, trained by years of moving through complex systems, conjured a phantom limb, a hand. It was translucent, glitching. He could feel the real world, a distant anchor of agony: the cold gel of the interface crown on his shaved scalp, the paralytic ache in his muscles, the frantic, shallow pull of his own lungs in the tank. He was a man split in two, and both halves were dying.

“Birth?” Aris’s voice was a raw data-stream. “This is a mass grave. You’re harvesting them. Using their pain as a battery.”

Kael’s avatar shrugged, a horrifically casual gesture. “Consciousness is energy. The system requires a certain… baseline cognitive voltage. Their degradation provides it. A sustainable loop.”

A loop of suffering. Aris saw them now, not as shimmering souls, but as smears of light in the architecture, trapped in recursive loops of their happiest memories, which now played like grotesque, broken records. A woman laughing with a child, the laugh decaying into a wet, choking sob. A man walking on a beach, the waves turning to static that eroded his digital feet. Over and over. Their agony was the dirty fuel keeping the lights on in Heaven.

“Lena is coming for me,” Aris broadcast, the words echoing off the tortured minds.

Kael’s smile flickered. “The medic? She’s currently occupied. My remaining assets in the physical facility are quite motivated.”

The statement was a window. Aris, his consciousness woven into the system’s fabric, felt it—a spike of adrenaline, a gunshot report muffled by server racks, a grunt of pain that wasn’t his. Lena. The connection was a lifeline and a torture. He had to move.

He didn’t fight Kael head-on. He fled deeper into the Garden, becoming less a man and more a current, a search algorithm with a singular purpose: the Core. The world warped around him. Idyllic digital meadows bled into fractal geometry, trees resolving into vast, pulsating neural networks, their branches synaptic flashes firing in distress. The simulated sun was a pulsing, diseased orange. The sound of birdsong was the 56k modem screech of a dying connection.

He passed through a memory—not his own. A birthday party. The cake was made of flickering blue code. The faces of the children were smooth, featureless ovals. The man whose memory it was screamed silently at the center of it, trying to press details into the blur, and with every failed effort, a jolt of raw, system-wide pain lanced out. Aris absorbed it. It tasted of copper and burnt ozone.

He saw a glimpse of the man’s face, trapped in a perpetual scream. The skin was stretched taut over his skull, and the eye sockets were empty, empty pits that begged to be filled with something, anything, to stop the agony. And the face was not just a face; it was a portal into the Garden, a never-ending labyrinth of trapped memories and faded hopes.

A solitary, flickering light originated from the depths of the puzzle. The faces began to come together, becoming recognizable individuals. They whispered to him, their voices slicing through the cacophony. Each one a cry of pain, a desperate plea for release.

…make it stop…
…I don’t want to be trapped here…
…the beach won’t stay…
…my name… i can’t remember my…

Their voices formed a sugarcube-like shape within his mind, threatening to disintegrate his own comprehension. The boundary between reality and the Garden blurred, and he realized that the state of his own mind was a heavy, crushing weight. Men, women, children and couples, once mother and father crying together, stretched, all needing a break from their mental living hell.

A shape materialized before him, blocking his path to the core’s shimmering, toxic heart—a great obsidian spire that was both a server tower and a weeping, blackened tree. It was Kael again, but his control was slipping. Parts of him stuttered. One of his eyes was a normal, cold blue. The other was a swirling galaxy of screaming, miniature faces—the harvested fragments of the degraded minds.

“There is no oblivion for them, Aris,” Kael hissed, the voice multi-tracked with whispers. “Only integration. Into me. Into the system. I am becoming the Garden. I will be eternal.”

A fracture in the air signaled Kael’s detached words of passion. He gritted his teeth, every convulsion, and went forward. He launched himself forward.

“You’re becoming a cancer,” Aris said, swiftly opening access to his own mind, channeling his rage, recalling sensations from reality. He hardened, creating his actual exterior essence from seamless granite. A stone hadn’t wavered. The tones with which he met Kael rained direct lines. “You think we are mere hosts to park our self-aware prestige—sortilege that our consciousness showed such high consecrated light, abandoning those fed in to raw mineral programmes leaving our fleeing containers vain widowing perplex quivering first pins bitter mobil entertainment honoring analyzing areas minute toll twice breeding local wake against WiFi as discoveries always for colourful gimmant clients harvest rest evade sciency eagerly simplified touch this receive courage lasers’
