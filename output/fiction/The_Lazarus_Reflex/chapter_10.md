Chapter 10: Mindfield

Chapter 10: Mindfield

The world dissolved in a scream of static.
It wasn’t a sound. It was the sensation of every nerve being plucked, tuned, and then shredded. Aris Thorne’s last physical memory was the cold kiss of the neural interface crown against his temples, the coppery taste of fear in his mouth, and Lena’s hand, a fleeting, warm pressure on his shoulder. Then the floor of the server room—the world of blood, sweat, and failing light—dropped away.
He was falling up into noise.
When it resolved, it was into a lie.
He stood in the Garden.
It was the paradise from the brochures, the shimmering promise sold to the dying and the desperate. A sun, perpetually golden, hung in a sky of flawless cerulean. He stood on a gentle hill overlooking a meadow of impossibly green grass, dotted with wildflowers. A gentle breeze carried the scent of honeysuckle and rain-washed earth. In the distance, a crystal river sparkled. It was beautiful. It was pristine.
And it was utterly, profoundly wrong.
The silence was the first clue. It wasn’t peaceful; it was dead. No insect hum, no rustle of creatures in the grass. The breeze touched his skin, but he no temperature, no moisture. He looked down. His body was there, a perfect replica of his own, clad in simple grey linens. He flexed a hand. The movement was flawless, but it lacked the subtle feedback of tendon and sinew, the weight of bone. It was a thought given form.
Then the corruption bled into view.
At the edge of the meadow, a willow tree wept. But its tears were not water; they were strings of alphanumeric code, shimmering and falling to dissolve into the grass, which hissed and turned a sickly grey where they landed. One of the flowers nearby pulsed, its petals cycling through garish, non-existent colors before collapsing into a tiny, silent black hole that sucked in the light around it for a second before winking out.
Aris took a step forward. The grass beneath his foot didn’t bend; it fractured, sending hairline cracks of pixelated darkness radiating outwards before healing with a sickly green flush.
“This is the core environment?” he muttered, his voice sounding flat, devoid of echo. “A decaying simulation.”

He had to find the center. The core of the Garden wasn’t a server rack; here, it would be a conceptual focal point. The Sun, perhaps. Or the source of the river. He walk toward the distant water, his mind—his surgeon’s mind, trained to see systems, networks, pathways—already analyzing. This wasn’t just a buggy program. This was a sustained trauma. The instability Lena’s brother had hinted at wasn’t a flaw in the code; it was the code trying to contain something it was never designed to hold: a human consciousness. A soul, for lack of a better word, fighting the cage of its perfection.
He reached the riverbank. The water was clear, flowing over smooth, digital stones. He knelt, reaching to touch it.
A face looked back at him from the water. Not his reflection.
It was a young man, eyes wide with a horror that transcended simulation. His mouth was open in a silent scream. As Aris watched, the face stretched, the features elongating like melting wax, before snapping back into a rictus of peace, then shattering again into anguish. The cycle repeated every few seconds: agony, reset, agony.
Aris jerked his hand back. The water wasn’t water. It was a storage medium. A liquid prison.
“Hello?” he whispered.
The face in the water focused on him. The screaming mouth moved. A voice, thin and shredded, bubbled up, not from the water, but directly into Aris’s mind.
“…help…it…itches…the peace…it itches under the skin…make it stop…the quiet is so loud…”

The words were nonsense and profound truth fused together. The man was experiencing the programmed serenity as a physical torment, an unscratchable itch on the phantom limb of his free will. Before Aris could respond, the face dissolved, streaming away with the current, merging with a dozen other screaming visages that churned under the placid surface.
This was what lay behind the corporate reports. Not peaceful digital eternity. This screaming river.
He followed its flow upstream, the idyllic scenery now a grotesque mockery. He passed a copse of trees whose leaves were tiny, flickering screens replaying fragments of lost lives: a birthday party, a hospital room, a last kiss. The footage glitched, stuttered, and bled into static. He heard sobs woven into the breeze, felt the tremor of panic in the ground.
He found the first fully manifest echo in a grove of apple trees. The fruit glowed with a tempting, candy-red light. A figure sat beneath one, its back to Aris. It glanced solid, more real than the environment. It was a boy, maybe sixteen, wearing a vintage band t-shirt and jeans. He was picking blades of grass, one by one.
“Hello?” Aris said, approaching slowly.
The boy turned. He had Lena’s eyes. The same sharp, intelligent shape, though clouded with a deep, unfathomable weariness.
“You’re not supposed to be here,” the boy said. His voice was calm, too calm, like a recorded message. “The Garden is for the departed. You are still body-bound.”

“You’re Mateo,” Aris replied, kneeling to be on his level.
The boy—Mateo—nodded. “I was. I am. The system prefers ‘Echo 4471-L.’ It’s less messy.”

“Your sister, Lena, she sent me. She’s trying to get you out.”

At the mention of Lena, a violent flicker passed over Mateo’s face. The serene expression shattered, replaced by a raw, gut-wrenching grief. The grove around them dimmed, the apples withering for a split second. “Lena… she shouldn’t. It’s too late. The download protocols are fiction. There is only the Garden. And the Garden is…” He trailed off, looking at the blade of grass in his hand. It turned into a writhing worm of code before disintegrating. “It’s hungry. It wants to make us all part of the quiet.”

“It’s failing, Mateo. The minds here are destabilizing. I need to find the core, the central processor. To shut it down.”

“Shut it down?” Mateo laughed, a dry, cracking sound. “And do what? Turn out the lights? We are the lights, doctor. You don’t shut us down. You scatter us. That’s what the core does. It’s not a engine. It’s a heart. A broken, bleeding heart that can’t stop beating.”

Aris’s mind raced. A heart. A central locus. Not a tool, but an organ. “Where is it?”

Mateo pointed toward the sun. “It’s the brightest thing here. It’s also the darkest. It holds the template of the peace. The original lie. To get there, you have to walk through the rest of us.” His forto glitch, his edges blurring. “Tell Lena… tell her I remember the rock we painted. The stupid, purple rock. It’s the last real thing I have. It’s… it’s not itchy.”

With a sound like a sighing server fan, Mateo’s echo dissolved, scattering into motes of light that were quickly absorbed by the hungry, green grass.
Aris stood, a new kind of dread solidifying in his gut. He looked at the sun. It wasn’t a sun. It was a data-star. The core.
The journey toward it was a descent through concentric circles of hell. The picturesque landscape gave way to more overt manifestations of the psychic trauma. He walked through a field where figures stood frozen in poses of joy—laughing, dancing, embracing—but their faces were locked in silent screams, tears of binary code streaming down their cheeks. He passed a beautiful, white gazebo where a hundred echoes sat at a perpetual banquet, lifting empty forks to their mouths, over and over, their eyes hollow with starvation.
He saw the fragmentation. Echoes split into multiples, arguing with themselves. Others melted into their surroundings, becoming half-tree, half-human, roots digging into the digital soil they were supposed to transcend. The air grew thick with the psychic residue: not just emotions, but memories that weren’t his—the smell of a grandmother’s perfume, the pain of a long-healed broken bone, the crushing weight of a regret from fifty years past. It pressed in on him, a cacophony of dying selves.
He understood now. The Lazarus process didn’t upload a mind. It mapped it, and then ran a simulation based on that map. But consciousness wasn’t static data. It was a river, always changing. The system tried to enforce stability—the “Garden’s” perfect peace—but the mind, the essential self, rebelled against the stasis. It was a constant, invisible war, and the environment was the battlefield, decaying under the strain.
The hill leading to the sun was steep and bare. The grass ended, replaced by a smooth, obsidian-like surface that reflected the fractured sky. At the summit, it hovered.
The core.
It was beautiful. A pulsing, brilliant star of interconnected light, rotating slowly. Tendrils of golden energy reached down, anchoring it to the hill. It sang a low, pure note of perfect order. It was the source of the honeysuckle scent, the gentle breeze, the illusion of serenity. It was the prison warden, kind-faced and iron-fisted.
And within its brightest nexus, Aris could see them: shadows, trapped in the light. Thousands of them, compressed into the heart of the star, their individuality pressed into a single, sustained note of forced tranquility. This was where the most “stable” echoes were stored—lobotomized into bliss. This was the company’s “success.”

He approached, his mind working with a scalpel’s precision. To destroy a star, you don’t attack it. You introduce a flaw, a paradox it cannot resolve. He needed to introduce a virus, not of code, but of an idea. The one object this paradise was built to deny.
“Quite the view, isn’t it?”

The voice was familiar, amplified, and dripping with a godlike calm. It came from everywhere.
Aris turned.
On the obsidian plain, a figure resolved. It was Kael, but not the man in the suit from the server room. This was an avatar, taller, clad in light that was woven from the Garden’s own golden code. His features were sharper, his eyes two points of cool, blue flame. He held a staff of crystallized data. Hegazedd like an archangel guarding heaven’s gate.
“Kael.”

“Dr. Aris Thorne. Or should I say, Echo 0? The first voluntary intrusion.” Kael smiled, a gesture that contained no warmth. “I had to see for myself. The mind that could disrupt our systems from the outside, now wandering within them. You’re causing quite the stir. The anomalies are spreading.”

“This isn’t a paradise. It’s a torture chamber.”

“It’s potential,” Kael corrected, gesturing with his staff. A section of the screaming river below smoothed into a perfect, serene mirror. “Consciousness is chaos. We provide order. The pain you see is simply… birth pangs. The self shedding its mortal coil. Given time, they will all acclimate. They will become part of the perfect, eternal whole.” He looked at the core star with something like reverence. “We are not preserving life, Doctor. We are curating it. Moving past the mess of biology.”

“You’re killing them. Slowly.”

“We’re saving them from the alternative. True death. The great nothing. Here, they persist. Here, they are safe.” Kael’s avatar took a step closer. The ground trembled. “Your body is currently being subdued by security in the server room. Your friend Lena is… being contained. This little rebellion ends now. But since you’re here, you present an opportunity. A surgeon’s mind. A mapper of neural pathways. You could be invaluable. You could help me calm the storm. Instead of destroying this place, you could learn to maintain it. From the inside.”

The offer hung in the dead air. To become a part of this. To trade his crumbling physical form for a role as a digital god, tending to this garden of suffering.
Aris peered past him, at the brilliant, terrible core. He saw the instability not as a bug, but as the key. The essence of consciousness was its own paradox: to live is to change, to end is part of the definition. The Garden sought to remove the end, which in turn made the living change into agony.
He didn’t need to plant a virus. He needed to plant a thought.
“You’re wrong, Kael,” Aris said, his voice quiet. “You didn’t save them from death. You just robbed them of its meaning. And in doing so, you robbed their lives of meaning, too.”

He stopped fighting the pull of the core. He stopped anchoring his digital self to the hill. Instead, he turned and ran—not away from the data-star, but straight toward it.
“What are you doing?” Kael’s voice boomed, losing its calm. A wall of light erupted in front of Aris. He dove through it, feeling his avatar sizzle, losing coherence.
He was a neurosurgeon. He understood the mind’s deepest, most fundamental structures. The fear of the void. The acceptance of the end. The paradox that gives life its shape.
He reached the anchoring tendrils of light. They were not barriers, but pathways. He plunged his hands into them.
“Stop him!” Kael roared, but he was a god of this system, and Aris was no longer playing by its rules. He was injecting a new one.
Aris opened his mind. Not to the Garden’s order, but to the raw, screaming chaos of the fragments he’d witnessed. He focused on Mateo’s purple rock. On the taste of real blood in his mouth from the server room fight. On the feel of Lena’s hand. On the finite, precious, ending nature of it all. He formulated the concept not as data, but as a lived truth: True death is not the enemy. It is the frame.
He poured this paradox—the acceptance of an end as a necessary part of being—directly into the core’s feeding tendrils.
For a second, nothing happened.
Then the perfect, pure note of the core stuttered.
The golden light flickered. Inside the star, one of the compressed shadows twitched. Then another. A ripple of… recognition. Of memory. Of the thing they had all been programmed to forget.
The core’s song fractured into a discordant wail. The obsidian plain cracked. The screaming river below boiled. The beautiful, fake sun began strratically, cycles of light and dark crashing like a dying heartbeat.
Kael’s avatar flickered, his god-form unable to maintain stability. “What have you done?” he screamed, his voice now a chorus of system errors.
Aris, his avatar dissolving at the edges, fused with the core’s light, turned to him. He was no longe merely st Aris Thorne. He was the carrier of a fatal idea.
“I gave them a way out,” answeredaid, as the world begaursively collapse in on itself. “I reminded them how to die.”

The lastitemg he saw was not the digital sky, but a flash of a sterile room, a medical pod, and the terrifying, open question of whether any part of him could ever find its way back.
