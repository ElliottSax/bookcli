Chapter 2: Assembling the Leftovers

Chapter 2: Assembling the Leftovers

The scent of stale fryer oil and regret was a physical presence in The Grotto’s kitchen, a greasy film that coated the back of Elara’s throat. It was a symphony of decay: the sour tang of over-ripe tomatoes, the acrid bite of ammonia struggling against grime, the underlying, melancholic sweetness of yesterday’s seafood special now firmly today’s mistake. For a woman who could taste the chef’s resignation in an under-seasoned bechamel, it was a form of exquisite torture.

She leaned against the stainless-steel pass, watching him. Leo Finch moved with a drunkard’s careful precision, a ballet of avoidance. His hands, once celebrated in Le Monde for their “preternatural grace,” were now stained with old burns and fresh grease. He shucked a sack of onions, his knife-work still fluid, still perfect, each papery skin falling away to reveal identical orbs of white flesh. But there was no joy in it, no intent. It was mechanical, a ghost going through the motions.

“Finch,” Elara said, her voice cutting through the clatter of the dish pit.

He didn’t look up. “Review’s on Friday. Tell Jacques the scallops will still be frozen in the middle and the steak will taste of despair. He knows.”

“I’m not here for a review.”

That made him pause. He lifted his head, and Elara saw the wreckage. The eyes that had once sparkled with mischievous genius were now the color of dirty dishwater, bloodshot and deeply wary. He’d grown a patchy beard that failed to hide the softening of his jawline. He smelled of cheap gin and onion tears.

“Then you’re lost, darling. The dining room’s out front. Mind the puddle by door three. It’s been weeping since ’19.”

“I need a forger,” Elara said, keeping her voice low. “The best.”

Leo let out a short, wet laugh and returned to his onions. The knife thwacked against the board with rhythmic finality. “The best is dead. Drowned in a vat of his own hubris and a rather pedestrian Barolo. I read the obituary. It was… comprehensive.”

“I read it too. I wrote it.” The words hung in the greasy air. She saw his shoulders tense, the knife falter for a microsecond. “I said the pigeon en croûte you served at L’Éclat tasted like a betrayal of the bird’s very existence. That the foie gras torchon had the emotional depth of a puddle.”

“You said it wept ‘tears of culinary cowardice,’” he recited, his voice flat. “A memorable turn of phrase. It’s on the wall in the owner’s office. A warning to the staff.”

“It was accurate,” Elara said, not unkindly. “You were phoning it in. Using cheap truffle oil, subbing out wild turbot for farmed. I could taste the shortcuts. The lies.”

He finally turned, wiping his hands on a grimy apron. “And what do you taste now, Elara Vance? In this temple of gastronomy?”

She inhaled, letting the complex, foul bouquet separate on her palate. “I taste anger. Not hot, but cold, like a closed fridge. I taste shame, metallic and sharp. And I taste a staggering amount of Gilbey’s Gin.” She took a step closer. “But under all that, Leo… I can still taste the hand that could replicate a three-star consommé from memory. The palate that could deconstruct a 1982 Pétrus and tell you the vineyard’s slope. That man isn’t dead. He’s just in deep storage.”

For a flicker, something sparked in his dead eyes. Pride, perhaps, or its ghost. Then it guttered out. “You need a drink. Or I do. Same difference.”

“I need you to forge a Luna Bianca.”

The silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the distant glug-glug-glug of a malfunctioning dishwasher. Leo stared at her, then his face crumpled into genuine, wheezing laughter. “Oh, brilliant! Even better! Not just a truffle, but the ghost truffle. The one that doesn’t exist. Perfect for the forger who doesn’t exist anymore. Poetic. Now piss off, I’ve got onion rings to batter.”

“It does exist. It’s in the city. In a biometric case, inside a Scent Lock room, at the Gala of the Golden Vine.”

He stopped laughing. The professional in him, the artist who’d once spent seventy-two hours perfecting a counterfeit white Alba truffle out of a hybrid mushroom and essence of oak, stirred. “A Scent Lock? For a truffle?”

“To contain its aroma. To make it a secret until the moment it’s shaved.”

“Idiots,” he muttered, almost to himself. “The volatility… the terroir… locking it in is like suffocating a songbird.” He shook his head, the curiosity snuffed out by self-preservation. “No. Impossible. Even if I had my old lab, my sources… the Luna Bianca is a myth. A story told to rich men to make them feel like kings.”

“What if I got you a sample? A single shaving.”

He went very still. “You can’t.”

“If I could. Could you replicate it? Not just the look. The aroma. The taste. The… emotional fingerprint.”

He studied her, his gaze sharpening, the drunkard receding momentarily. “You’re serious. You’re actually, terrifyingly serious. Why? What’s in it for you? A scoop? Redemption?”

“A clean slate,” she said, the truth tasting like ash. “And you’d get one, too. Enough money to disappear. Or to reopen a real kitchen. Not this…” She gestured at the weeping wall, the congealing fryer.

He picked up his knife, running a thumb along the dull edge. The conflict in him was a taste she could almost name: bitter hope fighting with the familiar, creamy decay of surrender. “Who else?” he asked finally.

“Just one other. For security.”

Leo’s head snapped up, a fresh, more potent anger flashing across his face. “No. No, you are not dragging that paranoid harpy into this.”

“She’s the best.”

“She’s a ruin. She’ll have us all in prison before we’ve even chosen a getaway font.”

“You know her?” Elara asked, though the bitter, coppery taste of their shared history was already in the air.

“Margot Chen,” he spat the name like a pit, “is the reason I was using truffle oil in the first place. Her exquisite palate identified my ‘82 Pétrus as a ‘83 from a lesser slope during a charity auction. Made a scene. A very loud, very public scene. The investor who’d bought the lot on my recommendation demanded a refund. My reputation, already teetering thanks to you, dove off the cliff. So, no. Not her.”

“She lost everything that night, too,” Elara said. She remembered the video: Margot Chen, elegant in emerald silk, screaming about lies in the glass, throwing a $30,000 bottle against the wall before collapsing into sobs. “Her firm dropped her. The wine world blacklisted her. She calls it ‘The Episode.’ Now she designs security for paranoid collectors. She knows how they think.”

“Because she is one,” Leo growled. But the fight was leaching out of him. The sheer, mad scale of the proposal was doing its work. The Luna Bianca. It was the ultimate canvas. He looked at his greasy, trembling hands. “A sample. You swear?”

“On what’s left of my soul.”

He nodded, once, a sharp, defeated gesture. “Then I’m in. But if Chen so much as looks at me sideways, I walk.”

**

Margot Chen’s apartment was a sensory deprivation chamber disguised as a minimalist loft. The air was filtered, odorless, a void that made Elara’s hyper-sensitive nose feel blind. The walls were white, the floors pale oak, the only furniture a low steel table and two uncomfortable-looking chairs. A single, flawless orchid sat on a plinth, looking like a prisoner.

Margot herself was a study in controlled tension. She wore a high-necked black sweater and tailored trousers, her black hair in a severe knot. She moved with an economy that suggested constant threat assessment. She didn’t offer them wine.

“Elara Vance,” Margot said, her voice cool and precise. “I read your piece on the ethical bankruptcy of tasting menus. It was… vigorous.” Her eyes, dark and unblinking, shifted to Leo. “Finch. You smell of failure and carbohydrates.”

“You smell of repressed hysteria and money,” Leo shot back, slouching against the doorframe. “Some things never change.”

“Sit.” It wasn’t a request. Margot activated a tablet on the table. A holographic schematic of the Metropolis Museum’s Grand Hall shimmered into being. “You want to steal the crown jewel of gastronomy from under the noses of two hundred of the world’s most powerful people, guarded by Sentinel Security, during an event that raises fifty million dollars for the preservation of… well, more food. It is, objectively, insane.”

“But?” Elara prompted, tasting the air. Beneath Margot’s clinical exterior, she detected a faint, thrilling note: the sharp, citrus zest of challenge.

“But it has a certain aesthetic appeal,” Margot conceded, a flicker in her dark eyes. “The Gala is a fortress. The Luna Bianca will arrive via armored transport at 1600 hours. It will be escorted by two Sentinel guards to the ‘Treasury’—a temporary Scent Lock chamber constructed in the Hall of Antiquities, here.” She zoomed in. The room was a clear cube within the larger hall. “Four-inch polycarbonate walls, negative air pressure, humidity and temperature controlled to mimic the truffle’s native soil. The case inside is a Veritas IX biometric vault. Retina, palm-print, and vocal passphrase from the head of Sentinel himself, Alistair Thorn. It opens once, at 2100, for the unveiling and shaving.”

“So we need Thorn’s eye, hand, and voice,” Leo said, throwing up his own hands. “Simple. I’ll just whip him up a nice risotto, he’ll hand them over.”

“The case is not the problem,” Margot said, ignoring him. “The problem is everything else. Motion sensors on the cube. Pressure plates on the pedestal. Ultrasound emitters that would shatter the truffle if the glass is breached incorrectly. Three roving guard teams. CCTV with AI-assisted behavioral analysis. Every guest, waiter, and musician is vetted to a degree that would make a Secret Service agent blush.”

The holographic security layers piled on, a glowing, impenetrable net. The zest of challenge in Elara’s mouth soured into the chalk of despair.

“Then it’s impossible,” Elara said, her blackmail photos seeming to burn in her pocket.

“I said it was a problem. I didn’t say it was insoluble.” Margot swiped the schematic away. A new image appeared: a chaotic, bustling kitchen. “The Gala’s main kitchen. It will service fifteen three-star chefs preparing one-off canapés. There will be forty line cooks, fifteen sommeliers, runners, dishwashers, maître d’s. It will be a glorious, shouting, fire-breathing madhouse.”

Leo leaned forward, intrigued despite himself. “Your point, Chen? That we die in a more interesting location?”

“My point, Finch, is that Sentinel Security, in their arrogance, installed the central security hub for the entire Gala in the pantry off this kitchen.” She highlighted a small, unmarked room. “They believed no one would look for it in the heart of the chaos. They believed the kitchen staff were background noise. They believed chefs were not threats.” A thin, icy smile touched her lips. “It is their one, beautiful, fatal flaw.”

The air in the odorless room seemed to crackle. Elara could taste it now, the plan coalescing: the smoky tang of risk, the clear, bright note of a narrow pathway opening in the dark.

“We go in as kitchen staff,” Elara breathed.

“You,” Margot corrected, “go in as Elara Vance, disgraced critic, doing a behind-the-scenes piece for a rehabilitating online journal. I have the credentials forged already. You will have reason to be everywhere, asking questions, tasting things. A nuisance, but an authorized one.”

“And me?” Leo asked, his voice tight.

“You,” Margot said, her gaze finally meeting his with a glint of something that might have been perverse satisfaction, “will be Chef Léo Finchet, a last-minute replacement from a minor Montreal bistro, specializing in foraged canapés. Your station will be closest to the pantry door.”

Leo’s face went pale. “You want me to cook? In that? I’ll be exposed in five minutes!”

“You’ll be a harried, mediocre chef from Montreal. No one will look twice. Your job is to create a diversion at 2045 hours. A small, contained, but very aromatic kitchen disaster that requires the attention of at least one guard team and sends the AI behavioral analysis into a tailspin trying to categorize the panic.”

“And you?” Elara asked.

Margot’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I will be in the hall. As a guest. I will be the one who, in the ensuing distraction, gets close enough to Alistair Thorn to acquire his biometrics.”

“How?” Leo scoffed. “Ask him to lean in for a selfie?”

“I will spill a very specific, very sticky, and very radioactively traceable vintage port on him,” Margot said calmly. “He will have to leave the floor to have it cleaned. The private washroom for VIPs is on my schematic. It is the only place he will be alone, without his detail. That is my window.”

The audacity of it was breathtaking. It was a dish made of broken glass and desperation, but it had structure. It had flavor.

“And the sample for me?” Leo pressed. “You haven’t explained that.”

“During the distraction, before you create your own,” Elara said, the final piece clicking into place with a cold, definitive taste of metal, “I will be in the chaos of the kitchen. I will get into the security hub. I will disable the ultrasound emitters and the pressure plates for a ninety-second window. And I will open the Veritas case.”

They both stared at her. “You have the passphrase? The biometrics?” Margot asked, her clinical facade finally showing a fracture of surprise.

“No,” Elara said. The memory of the blackmail photos—her own youthful, desperate face—flashed before her. “But I can taste a lie. And security systems, like recipes, are built on logic. I’ll find the truth it wants to hear.” She didn’t believe it, not fully, but saying it made it taste possible.

The three of them sat in the sterile silence, the plan hanging in the air between them, fragile and monstrous. The disgraced critic, the drunken forger, the paranoid security analyst. A crew of leftovers, assembled for one last, impossible course.

Margot stood, breaking the moment. “I will provide the uniforms, the credentials, the port, and the radioisotope tracer. You two provide the skills you supposedly still possess.” She looked at Leo, then at Elara. “We meet once more, for a tasting. Finch, you will prepare your proposed diversion. Vance, you will tell me if his fear is as palpable as it is now. Then, we either proceed or we disband and forget this ever happened.”

As they were shown out, Elara paused at the door. The odorless air of the apartment had been replaced by the complex, dirty symphony of the city. She turned back to Margot. “Why are you doing this? Really?”

Margot Chen stood perfectly still in her white room. For a second, her mask slipped, and Elara tasted it—a deep, old, resonant note of humiliation, so profound it had curdled into something else. A need to prove that the world that broke her was, itself, breakable.

“Because,” Margot said softly, “that night, the Pétrus was* a lie. But it wasn’t the wine that was counterfeit.” She closed the door, leaving Elara with the chilling aftertaste of an unanswered question, and the certainty that Margot Chen was the most dangerous ingredient of them all.
