Chapter 5: The Missing Morsel

Chapter 5: The Missing Morsel

The scream was not human. It was a high, keening shriek of pure, unadulterated loss, the sound a soul might make upon finding its own grave empty. It cut through the low, satisfied hum of the Gala’s final act—the serving of the Périgord Noir soufflés—and froze the opulent room solid.

Silas Thorne stood before the open, climate-controlled display case in the center of the dining hall. His hands, usually so composed, fluttered like wounded birds around the empty velvet pillow. His face was a grotesque mask of disbelief, etched so deeply it looked carved. “Gone,” he whispered, a sound that carried further than any shout. Then, louder, a raw-throated roar: “IT IS GONE!”

For three heartbeats, there was perfect silence. Then chaos, hot and sharp, erupted.

Elara, standing rigid by a service station with a tray of empty champagne flutes, felt the world tilt. The plan had been clean, surgical: Hugo’s diversion, Leo’s swap, her own retrieval during the dessert service pandemonium. The fake, Leo’s masterpiece, should be in the case. The real truffle should be nestled in the false bottom of her now-empty caviar trolley, ready for wheels-up in ninety minutes. But Thorne’s scream was not the sound of a man fooled by a perfect replica. It was the sound of a man staring into a void.

“Lights!” a voice boomed—Monsieur Roche, Thorne’s head of security, a bull of a man with eyes like chips of flint. The ambient, golden lighting snapped into a harsh, clinical white, bleaching the color from jewels and gowns, turning the beautiful people into startled mannequins. “No one moves! Seal the perimeter! All kitchen and service staff, remain exactly where you are!”

The great oak doors at the hall’s entrance thudded shut, followed by the heavy clunk of electronic bolts. Two armed guards took position before them. Panic, previously a simmering scent of sweat and adrenaline under perfume, now flooded the room. Elara’s hyperosmia, already strained by the night’s olfactory barrage, was assaulted. It was a tidal wave of sour fear, acrid confusion, and the cloying, burnt-sugar smell of shattered entitlement.

Breathe. Just breathe.

She caught Leo’s eye across the room. He was pale, his forger’s hands clenched at his sides, knuckles white. He gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head. Not my fault. Hugo, near the main kitchen doors, had his paranoid’s mask firmly in place—eyes scanning, calculating angles, exits now nonexistent. Margot, the disgraced critic playing a server, looked like she might be sick. Only Chef Valérie, a monolith in her whites at Elara's professional kitchen entrance, showed no outward tremor.

“The truffle,” Roche announced, his voice a cold blade through the babble, “has been stolen. In approximately ninety seconds, my team will begin a systematic search of every person in this room. Cooperation will be swift and absolute. Attempt to leave, or resist, and you will be detained.”

A collective gasp. A socialite wailed. Elara forced her lungs to work, filtering the panic. Under the top notes of terror, she sought the truffle’s own signature: that deep, loamy, erotic earthiness. Nothing. It was simply absent from the air. But as she parsed the emotional scents—fear had a metallic tang, guilt a greasy, spoiled-milk quality—she caught something else. A thread, cold and clear as a mountain stream, cutting through the hot soup of anxiety. Satisfaction. Not the warm glow of a job well done, but the sharp, icy flavor of a predator watching the herd stampede. It was close.

The crew regrouped by unspoken agreement, drifting toward a less crowded corner near a towering ice sculpture of a pheasant, now weeping in the harsh light.

“What the hell happened?” Hugo hissed, his voice low and venomous. “The swap was clean. I saw the case lock engage after Leo’s pass. Did you bottle the retrieval, Elara?”

“The retrieval window wasn’t until the soufflé service,” she shot back, keeping her own voice to a whisper. “It never left the case. Someone else took it. Before the swap.”

Leo’s face crumpled. “My piece… if they find my piece, it’s a blueprint of my technique. I’m finished.”

“We’re all finished if we don’t find the real one,” Margot muttered, her usual cynicism replaced by raw dread. “They’ll peel this place apart. They’ll find the trolley, the compartments…”

“Silence.”

The word was a whip-crack. Chef Valérie had approached, her presence imposing a terrible calm. Her eyes, the color of dark roast coffee, swept over them. “One of you,” she said, her French accent making the accusation sound both poetic and deadly, “has been very, very greedy. And very, very stupid.”

“We don’t have it, Chef,” Elara said, meeting her gaze.

“The thief is in this room,” Valérie continued, ignoring her. “Security’s net is for show. They will look in handbags and under tables. But a thief of this object? They are professional. The truffle is here, on someone’s person, or already hidden within Elara's professional kitchen’s chaos. And the thief is among us.” Her gaze lingered on each of them: the forger, the paranoid, the critic, the thief with the supernatural nose. “We will find it ourselves. Before Roche’s clowns do. Or we will all go down together.”

The crew stared at each other, a sudden, thick mistrust congealing the air between them. Hugo’s eyes narrowed at Leo. Leo looked desperately at Elara. Margot looked at everyone with fresh suspicion.

“We need to search,” Elara said, the logic cold and clear. “Pair off. Cover the back areas, the storage lockers, the dry goods. Look for anything out of place, any scent that doesn’t belong.” She didn’t add that she would be searching for that cold thread of satisfaction.

As they broke apart, Roche’s men began their clumsy, invasive pat-downs of the guests, provoking outraged squawks. The kitchen staff were being herded into the main kitchen for a more thorough search. The crew melted into the edges, using their knowledge of the service labyrinth.

Elara moved first toward the locker alcove, a narrow, dimly-lit corridor off the main kitchen lined with small, personal lockers for the temporary staff. The air here was a mix of stale sweat, old garlic, and industrial cleaner. She closed her eyes, inhaling deeply, trying to mute the cacophony of the Gala’s panic still vibrating through the walls.

And there it was again. That cold satisfaction. It was stronger here, layered over a recent, familiar scent: Hugo’s particular blend of gun oil, pine-needle anxiety, and a specific, sharp deodorant. She followed it to a locker at the end of the row—Hugo’s assigned locker, its combination lock dangling, open.

Her heart thudded against her ribs. This was wrong. Hugo was paranoid, not stupid. He’d never leave his locker open, especially not now.

Before she could reach for it, a heavy hand fell on her shoulder. Roche. Two of his guards flanked him.

“Step aside, mademoiselle,” he grunted.

“I was just—”

“I said step aside.”

He nudged her back and peered into the locker. He didn’t have to search. It sat centered on the small metal shelf, resting on a folded kitchen towel: a black truffle, perfectly round, exquisitely textured, the size of a small plum.

A slow, grim smile spread across Roche’s face. He didn’t pick it up. Instead, he pulled a UV penlight from his belt and flicked it on. He passed the beam over the truffle’s surface. In the darkness of the alcove, a tiny, intricate symbol glowed a faint electric blue on the truffle’s skin: Thorne’s personal authentication mark, microscopically etched onto the real truffle the day before.

But as the light hit it, the mark shimmered. Just slightly. A perfect copy, but under UV light, Leo’s unique resin compound had a minute, tell-tale fluorescence that real tuber melanosporum did not.

Roche’s smile vanished. “A forgery,” he breathed. Then his head snapped up. “This is a locker for the sommelier consultant. Hugo Renard.”

He whirled, barking orders. “Find Renard! Now!”

Elara’s mind raced. The fake was here. In Hugo’s open locker. Which meant the real truffle was still in play, and someone had just framed Hugo for the theft. The cold satisfaction she’d tasted—it hadn’t been Hugo’s. It belonged to the one who’d planted this.

She slipped away as Roche’s men stormed off, her thoughts a whirlwind. The frame was too neat. It pointed a blinding spotlight at Hugo, and by extension, at all of them. They were supposed to fracture now, to turn on each other.

Back in the main kitchen, the scene was one of controlled bedlam. Staff were lined up against stainless steel counters. Hugo was being roughly escorted in by two guards, his face a storm of fury and confusion.

“This is absurd!” Hugo snarled. “I had no reason to take it! My job was security!”

“Your locker was open, Renard,” Roche said, holding up the UV light and the false truffle in an evidence bag. “This was inside. A counterfeit. Where is the real one?”

“I didn’t put that there!”

“Who else had your combination?”

Hugo’s eyes swept the room, landing on his crew. The betrayal in his gaze was a physical blow. He looked at Leo. “The forger. He made it. He had access.”

All eyes turned to Leo, who shrank back. “I gave it to Elara for the swap! I haven’t seen it since!”

“And you,” Roche turned his flinty gaze on Elara. “The temporary chef de partie. You were seen near the locker alcove. You have a record—petty theft, Paris, six years ago. Suspended sentence.”

Elara felt the walls close in. They had done their homework. The plan, which had seemed so elegant, now felt like a house of cards in a hurricane.

It was Chef Valérie who stepped into the breach. “Enough,” she stated, her voice slicing through the tension. “This pantomime is wasting time. The real truffle is not in this room. The thief would not be so idiotic as to hide it on their person now. They would have a secondary cache. Renard is being set up. Badly.” She glared at Roche. “Your focus on the obvious is what the thief desires. Search the waste systems. The ventilation ducts. The foundations.”

Roche bristled, but Thorne, who had been standing in the doorway like a ghost, spoke. His voice was hollow. “Do as she says. Tear this building apart. But these four…” He pointed a trembling finger at Elara, Leo, Hugo, and Margot. “They do not leave this kitchen. They are the nexus. The truth is here.”

Confined to a corner of Elara's professional kitchen under the watch of a single guard, the crew’s unity shattered.

“You sold us out,” Hugo spat at Leo, keeping his voice low. “You kept a second fake, planted it to throw suspicion my way when your first one failed.”

“Why would I frame you? That makes no sense!” Leo whispered back, frantic.

“Because you’re a coward! You couldn’t handle the pressure, so you created a fall guy!”

“Maybe Hugo’s playing a triple game,” Margot interjected, her voice brittle. “He ‘finds’ the fake in his own locker, the most obvious frame-up in history, knowing it looks too obvious. Reverse psychology.”

“You think I’d risk my neck for a fungus?” Hugo scoffed.

“Enough!” Elara’s command was a sharp hiss. She looked at them, her crew of broken, brilliant misfits, crumbling under the first real pressure. The cold scent of satisfaction was gone now, replaced by their hot, mutual distrust. But the thief’s satisfaction had been here, in this kitchen. It had lingered in the locker alcove. Someone among the staff, or… her gaze drifted to the impassive figure of Chef Valérie, now directing Roche’s men with ruthless efficiency.

Valérie, who had insisted the thief was among them. Valérie, who had such terrifying calm. Valérie, who had access to everything and everyone.

A young, nervous commis chef approached Valérie, holding a small, crumpled piece of parchment. “Chef? We found this, wedged behind the main condenser unit for the walk-in. It’s… strange.”

Valérie took it, smoothed it open. Her eyebrows lifted a fraction. She showed it to Thorne, who peered at it, his despair deepening.

“What is it?” Roche demanded.

“A note,” Valérie said, her voice oddly flat. She read it aloud, the words dropping into the silent kitchen like stones.

“‘A dish of this caliber deserves a proper finish. The final course will be served at dawn. Come alone to the source, and the Black Diamond will be returned. Tell the police, and it will be grated over a beggar’s boiled potatoes. - Le Goûter.’”

Le Goûter. The Taster.

A new silence descended, colder and more profound than before. It wasn’t a ransom note. It was a recipe. A challenge.

Thorne’s eyes burned with a feverish light. “The source…”

“The truffle oak grove. Your private field in Périgord,” Valérie murmured. “Where this year’s diamond was harvested.”

Roche swore. “It’s a trap. Or a wild goose chase. We cannot negotiate with a phantom!”

“We are not negotiating,” Thorne said, his voice gaining a shred of its old authority. “We are accepting an invitation to the final course.” He looked at the four suspects in the corner, his eyes lingering on Elara. “You. The one with the nose. You can smell deception, can’t you? I’ve heard the whispers. You’re coming with me.”

Elara’s blood ran cold. “What?”

“To the grove. At dawn. You will be my bloodhound. You will smell the truth, or you will share the thief’s fate.” He turned to Roche. “Keep the others here. If the truffle is not in my hands by sunrise, arrest them all for conspiracy.”

As Thorne stalked away, issuing orders, Elara was left with the crumbling remains of her crew. Hugo’s face was etched with betrayal, Leo’s with terror, Margot’s with a resigned horror. The thief had not just stolen the truffle. They had stolen her team, her use, her exit.

And they had signed their note with a name that sent a shiver down her spine, a name from the deepest, most secret layer of the culinary underworld.

Le Goûter. The ghost who could taste a lie in a reduction, a betrayal in a béarnaise. A myth.

Or someone who knew that Elara’s greatest gift wasn’t just stealing things, but tasting the truth in the air. Someone who was now serving the next course directly to her.

The game had changed. The heist was over. Now, it was a duel.
