"You're joking," he said, but his voice had lost its edge.

Elara reached into her coat and withdrew a small, velvet pouch. She tossed it onto the cutting board. It landed with a soft *thud*. "I'm not."

Leo's fingers twitched. He didn't touch it. "That's a death sentence. The Gala is a fortress. The Scent Lock is a vault. And the Luna Bianca... it's a myth. A fairy tale for rich people who want to believe in magic."

"It's real. And I need it. Tonight."

His eyes flicked to the pouch, then back to her. "Why?"

"Because someone is going to die if I don't get it."

Leo exhaled sharply, his breath carrying the ghost of yesterday's gin. "That's not an answer."

"It's the only one you're getting."

A long moment passed. The kitchen's hum filled the silence—the distant clatter of pots, the hiss of a faulty exhaust fan, the occasional *plop* of something unidentifiable hitting the floor. Then, with a sigh, Leo reached for the pouch. His fingers, still stained with onion juice, hesitated before opening it.

Inside, nestled in black velvet, was a single, perfect truffle. Its surface gleamed with an unnatural sheen, a pearlescent luster that seemed to shift in the dim kitchen light. The scent that rose from it was indescribable—earthy, yes, but with an undercurrent of something else, something that made the hairs on the back of Leo's neck stand up.

"Christ," he whispered. "It's... it's alive."

Elara nodded. "It's the last one. The last true Luna Bianca. And it's mine."

Leo's eyes flicked up to hers, searching. "Why me?"

"Because you're the only one who can do this. The only one who can replicate it. The only one who can make it disappear."

Leo's fingers trembled as he reached for the truffle, lifting it gently from the pouch. The moment it touched his skin, a jolt of something—energy, perhaps, or memory—shot through him. His breath hitched.

"You remember," Elara said softly. "You remember what it's like to be the best."

Leo's throat worked. He swallowed hard, his eyes never leaving the truffle. "I remember," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "But I don't know if I can do it again."

"You can. You will."

Another long moment passed. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, Leo set the truffle back into the pouch and closed it. He looked up at Elara, his eyes clear for the first time in years.

"Alright," he said. "Let's get to work."

Bowls of ingredients lay scattered across the counter, their contents half-measured, half-forgotten. A blender hummed in the background, its contents a murky, unidentifiable sludge. The air was thick with the scent of mushrooms, garlic, and something else—something sharp and metallic, like the edge of a knife.

Leo worked quickly, his hands moving with a precision that belied the years of neglect. He measured, mixed, tasted, adjusted. Each step was deliberate, each motion calculated. The truffle sat in the center of the counter, a silent sentinel, its presence a constant reminder of what was at stake.

Arms crossed, Elara watched, her expression unreadable. She had seen Leo work before, of course—had watched him create dishes that were nothing short of alchemy. But this was different.

"You're sure about this?" Leo asked, not looking up from his work.

"Absolutely."

He nodded, his lips pressed into a thin line. "Alright. Then we need to move fast. The Gala starts in two hours. We don't have time for mistakes."

"I know."

Leo's hands stilled for a moment, his fingers hovering over a bowl of finely chopped herbs. "You understand what this means, don't you? If we get caught..."

"I know what it means."

He exhaled sharply, his breath shaky. "Alright. Then let's do this."

A spectacle of excess, the Gala of the Golden Vine filled the grand ballroom with a sea of tuxedos and gowns, of glittering jewels and polished shoes. Perfume and wine, expensive colognes and the faint, underlying tang of sweat thickened the air.

Elara moved through the crowd like a shadow, her presence unnoticed, her steps silent. She had spent years perfecting the art of invisibility, and tonight was no different. The guests around her were oblivious, their attention focused on the spectacle before them—the food, the wine, the performance.

She found the Scent Lock room easily. Tucked away in a quiet corner of the ballroom, its door was unmarked, its presence unassuming. But Elara knew what it was, knew what it contained. And she knew that if she didn't get inside, someone was going to die.

The door was locked, of course. But locks were no obstacle. A few quick motions with her lockpicks, and the door swung open.

Inside, the small room had walls lined with shelves of glass jars. Each jar contained a single, perfect truffle, its surface gleaming in the dim light. But Elara's eyes were drawn to the center of the room, to the biometric case that sat on a pedestal, its surface smooth and unblemished.

The Luna Bianca.

She approached it slowly, her steps measured, her breath steady. The case was locked, of course, but Elara had anticipated that. From her pocket, she withdrew a small, silver device—a biometric scanner, one that she had spent weeks perfecting.

She pressed it against the case, her fingers trembling slightly. The device beeped softly, its light turning green. The case clicked open.

Inside, nestled in a bed of black velvet, was the truffle. Smaller than she had imagined, its surface held a delicate, pearlescent sheen. An indescribable scent rose from it—earthy, yes, but with an undercurrent of something else, something that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand up.

Her fingers hovered just above its surface. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, she lifted it from its bed and placed it in the velvet pouch at her waist.

She turned to leave, her steps quick and silent. But as she reached the door, a voice stopped her.

"Elara."

She froze, her hand on the doorknob. She knew that voice. Knew the man who owned it.

She turned slowly, her expression unreadable. The man standing before her was tall, his face lined with age, his eyes sharp and calculating. He was dressed in a tuxedo, his posture rigid, his presence commanding.

"Lucien," she said, her voice steady. "I should have known you'd be here."

Lucien smiled, his lips curling into a cold, calculating expression. "Of course. The Gala is my event. And you are my guest."

Elara's eyes flicked to the truffle at her waist, then back to Lucien. "I'm not your guest. I'm here for the truffle."

Lucien's smile widened. "Ah, yes. The Luna Bianca. A rare and precious thing. And one that you have no right to."

Elara's hand tightened around the doorknob. "I have every right. It's mine."

Lucien's expression darkened. "It belongs to the Gala. To the Golden Vine. And you have stolen it."

Elara's breath hitched. "I haven't stolen anything. I'm taking what's rightfully mine."

Lucien's eyes narrowed. "You are a thief, Elara. And thieves are punished."

Elara's heart pounded in her chest, but her voice remained steady. "I'm not a thief. And I'm not afraid of you."

Lucien's smile returned, cold and calculating. "We'll see about that."

The kitchen was a mess. Bowls of ingredients lay scattered across the counter, their contents half-measured, half-forgotten.

Elara watched, her arms crossed, her expression unreadable. She had seen Leo work before, of course—had watched him create dishes that were nothing short of alchemy. But this was different. This was something else entirely.

"You're sure about this?" Leo asked, not looking up from his work.

"Absolutely."

He nodded, his lips pressed into a thin line. "Alright. Then we need to move fast. The Gala starts in two hours. We don't have time for mistakes."
