Chapter 9: The Cost of Mending

The heart of the shop, usually a symphony of ticking clocks and whispering gears, was silent. The only sound was Elara’s own ragged breathing and the faint, discordant hum from Argus’s exposed core. The automaton lay on the great oak worktable, his chest-plate open, revealing a labyrinth of fractured crystal conduits and twisted, silver filigree that pulsed with a sickly, intermittent light. His left arm, the complex one with its hidden compartments and delicate articulation, was a ruin of sheared metal and dead wires.

“It’s not just broken,” Elara murmured, her fingers hovering over the damage. She didn’t touch it yet. She was learning to listen first. “It’s… grieving. The magic that animated it has been ripped out. It’s like looking at a severed limb.”

Kaelen stood at her shoulder, a steady, warm presence. He’d been brewing a pungent tea of ground moonroot and whisper-moss over a small brazier, the steam coiling in the lamplight. “The schematic from the Hollow Mage’s prison showed this configuration. It’s a thaumaturgic lattice. The arm wasn’t just a tool; it was a secondary focus for his sentience.”

Silas, perched on a stool by the window, scanned the fog-choked street. He spoke without turning. “Aethelgard’s Harvesters target these foci first. Cripple the will, then drain the power. Standard extraction protocol.” His voice was flat, but Elara heard the self-loathing beneath it. Remembered knowledge was a bitter tonic.

“Can you fix it?” The question came from the corner. Leo, the boy with the clockwork fox, sat with his back against a shelf of orphaned cogs, his small hands stroking the fox’s still back. He’d appointed himself Argus’s vigil-keeper.

Elara looked at the boy, then at Argus’s single, dimly glowing eye-lens. It watched her, a pinprick of patient blue in the wreckage. He had thrown himself between Leo and a Harvester’s energy-lash. The cost was this.

“Yes,” she said, and the word felt like a vow. She just didn’t know the price.

She began not with metal, but with memory. Placing her palms on the cool brass of Argus’s shoulder, she closed her eyes and reached out with the part of her that understood broken things. The shop around her faded. She felt the echo of the blow that had shattered the arm—a crackling violet pain. Deeper, she felt the older wound: the hollow, sucking void where a portion of Argus’s essential self had been harvested long ago. This new damage had agitated that old emptiness.

To mend this, the understanding came, clear and cold, you must fill the void. Not with borrowed magic, but with something foundational.

Her own magic was rooted in the shop. In every nail she’d driven, every ward she’d whispered into the floorboards, every happy memory she’d woven into the plaster. It was a self-replenishing well, fed by peace and purpose.

Today, it would not be enough.

She opened her eyes. “Kaelen, the ward-anchor above the door. The keystone.”

He under—
