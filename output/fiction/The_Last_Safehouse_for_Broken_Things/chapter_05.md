Chapter 5: First Assault

Chapter 5: First Assault

The quiet was the first thing to go.

It didn’t shatter; it dissolved. The comforting, dust-mote hum of Elara’s Mending & Miscellany—the sigh of settling floorboards, the whisper of steam in the old pipes, the soft, almost-melodic resonance of a hundred dormant magical items—simply faded. It was as if someone had thrown a heavy velvet blanket over the world. Elara, polishing the brass fittings on a self-rewinding spool of thread, looked up, her hands going still.

In the workshop, Kaelen gasped, a sharp, pained sound. He staggered back from the ancient grimoire he’d been attempting to stabilize, his fingers leaving no mark on the page. “It’s gone,” he whispered, his voice raw. “The hum. The life in the ink. It’s just… paper.”

Upstairs, in the room Elara had cleared for him, Argus’s single ocular lens flickered from a soft blue to a dull, warning amber. A low, grinding thrum emanated from his chest, where his fractured power-core was housed. “Perimeter silence,” his voice boomed, then softened to a grating whisper. “They are here.”

Silas materialized halfway through the wall of the Elara's Relics & Repairs front room, his form shimmering with agitation. “Dispelling charms,” he said, his usual playful lilt replaced by a cold, spectral clarity. “Layered. Professional. They’re not just hiding their approach; they’re scrubbing the magic from the air around the building. Our wards are blind.”

Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs. She’d known this day would come, had lain awake countless nights imagining the shape of it. Now that it was here, it felt both terrifyingly alien and grimly familiar. This was the other side of mending: the moment when something came to break what you’d built.

“Positions,” she said, and was surprised by the steel in her own voice. “Argus, the front door is your line. Do not cross the threshold unless we are overrun. Silas, you’re our eyes. Kaelen…” She looked at the librarian, who was staring at his trembling, cursed hands with a kind of horror. “The Elara's Relics & Repairs integrity. If they’ve dispelled the wards, the structural enchantments in the beams and bricks are next. This old place will come down on our heads.”

Kaelen met her gaze, the despair in his eyes hardening into a desperate resolve. He gave a tight nod.

The front window didn’t explode. It unwove. One moment it was there, a mosaic of bottle-glass panes held by centuries-old lead. The next, the lead seams liquefied and dripped like black tears, and the glass panes fell inward, not as shards, but as fine, harmless silica sand that hissed onto the floorboards. Through the gaping hole stepped three figures.

They were clad in sleek, grey uniforms devoid of insignia, but their bearing screamed Aethelgard. Their leader was a woman with a face like a honed blade, her hair shorn to silver stubble. At her hip hung not a weapon, but a complex orrery of interlocking brass rings that spun slowly, emitting the silence. Her two companions were bulkier, armed with blunt, industrial-looking rods that crackled with a hungry, nullifying energy.

“Elara Vess,” the woman stated, her voice flat. “By the authority of the Aethelgard Reclamation Directorate, you are harboring classified assets. Surrender them, and your cooperation will be noted.”

Elara stood behind her counter, a chipped teacup still in her hand. “This is a place of business. My clients’ repairs are confidential. You’re trespassing.”

A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched the woman’s lips. She gave a slight nod to her squad.

One of the brutes leveled his rod at Argus. A visible pulse, like a heat haze, shot from its tip. Argus took a step forward to meet it, but as the wave hit him, the light in his lens stuttered. A sickening, grinding screech came from his joints. He sank to one knee, the floorboards groaning in protest.

“Anti-construct pulses,” he rasped. “Primitive. Effective.”

The other agent moved toward the workshop door, his rod sweeping side to side. Where its field touched the shelves, minor enchantments died with little pops and fizzles—a forever-warm teapot went cold, a set of dancing shears fell still and clattered to the floor.

This was their strategy: not to fight, but to unmake. To reduce the safe haven to inert, broken things.

Then Silas flowed out of the ceiling directly above the leader. He didn’t attack—he couldn’t, not physically. Instead, he passed through the spinning brass orrery at her hip.

The effect was instantaneous and chaotic. Silas’s phase-state interacted violently with the precise magical instrument. The rings spun wildly, clashing against each other with a sound like angry bells. The blanket of silence ripped apart, and in its place came a deafening cacophony of twisted magic—a screeching feedback loop of negated energy. The leader cursed, fumbling at the malfunctioning device.

In that moment of distraction, Kaelen acted. He didn’t charge. He stumbled from the workshop, his face pale with concentration, and reached toward the nearest agent’s null-rod. His fingers, inches from the weapon, didn’t touch it. Instead, the complex enchantment woven into its core—the tightly bound formulae of suppression and unraveling—saw his curse as a kind of perverse invitation.

The rod didn’t break. It dissipated. The metal grew porous and flaked away like rotten wood. The glowing crystal at its tip darkened, cracked, and crumbled into inert dust that sifted through the agent’s fingers. The man stared, dumbfounded, at his empty hand.

“The librarian’s touch is weaponized!” the leader barked, slapping her now-smoking orrery and silencing it. “Subdue him!”

The disarmed agent lunged for Kaelen, who backed away, tripping over a footstool. Elara moved to help, but the second brute was already swinging his rod toward her shelves, aiming for a cluster of volatile elemental cores. She threw herself in its path, knowing the null-field would hurt, but preferring it to the explosion.

The pulse never hit her.

Argus, still on one knee, reached out a massive, trembling hand. He didn’t grab the agent. He grabbed the heavy oak support beam next to him, and with a roar of straining metal and will, he pulled. The entire building shuddered. A section of the ceiling above the agent collapsed in a cloud of plaster dust and lath, burying him in a non-lethal but immobilizing heap.

The cost for Argus was immense. The amber light in his lens flickered, dimmed to a murky brown, and he slumped forward, motionless save for a faint, distressed ticking from his chest.

“Argus!” Elara cried.

The leader, now ignoring her useless orrery, drew a slender, wicked-looking dagger from her boot. It was non-magical, brutally practical. She advanced on Kaelen, who was cornered against the wall, his cursed hands held up uselessly before him.

“A fascinating anomaly,” the woman said coldly. “But parchment and flesh tear the same way.”

Silas swooped down, howling, passing through her again and again. She shivered, her teeth chattering with the sudden cold, but her will was iron. She shrugged off the ghost’s influence and raised the dagger.

Elara’s mind raced, a frantic inventory of her Elara's Relics & Repairs. Nothing on the shelves was a weapon. Every charm, every trinket, was for mending, for preserving, for keeping. The old wards were dead, scrubbed away by the dispelling charms. The Elara's Relics & Repairs was dying around them.

No.

The thought was not desperate, but fierce. This was not just a Elara's Relics & Repairs. It was a memory of her grandmother’s laugh in the kitchen. It was the pride in her father’s eyes when she fixed her first clock. It was Kaelen finding a use for his curse, and Silas remembering a fragment of a song, and Argus choosing to stand a line. It was a thousand broken things whispering that they still had value.

She didn’t reach for a tool. She dropped to her knees and placed her bare palms flat on the wide, worn floorboard in the center of the room—the heartboard, her grandmother had called it, where the ley-lines of the building’s enchantments originally converged.

It was cold. Silent. Like touching a corpse.

Mending was about seeing the true shape of what was, and the memory of what could be. She closed her eyes. She pushed past the null-field, past the silence, down into the deep, slow memory of the building itself. She felt the ghost of the wards—not their complex formulae, but their intent. Their purpose. Safety. Sanctuary. Haven.

She poured her own will into that memory, not trying to rebuild the sophisticated magical architecture, but to awaken its foundational principle. She fed it the image of Kaelen’s hands saving instead of destroying. She fed it the sound of Argus’s sacrifice, a grinding roar of protection. She fed it the chill of Silas’s defiance. She fed it her own stubborn, unmagical love for this place.

She wasn’t repairing. She was reminding.

The heartboard grew warm under her hands.

A sound began, low and deep, like the roots of a great tree shifting. The very air in the Elara's Relics & Repairs thickened, grew heavy with the scent of ozone and old rosemary. The sand from the vanished window began to tremble, then rise, swirling in a miniature vortex.

The Aethelgard leader paused, dagger poised, her eyes widening.

From every mended item in the Elara's Relics & Repairs—from the self-rewinding spool, the now-cold teapot, the stilled shears, the stabilized grimoire in the workshop—a faint, silver thread of light emerged. They were not attacks. They were acknowledgments. They streamed toward Elara, weaving into a shimmering, nebulous web above her head.

The web pulsed once, a silent, visible wave of force.

It was not an explosion. It was a rejection.

The force did not shove; it insisted. It insisted that the agents were foreign, hostile, unmendable objects within a space dedicated to care. The law of this place, reforged in a moment of desperate need, was that such things did not belong.

The leader was flung backwards through the gaping window as if by a giant, gentle hand. She landed in a roll on the cobblestones outside. The agent buried in debris was excavated by the same insistency, the rubble lifting off him and depositing him unceremoniously into the street. The third, half-crushed under the beam Argus had pulled, was simply… moved, appearing dazed and unharmed beside his comrades.

The silent, silver web faded. The warmth in the floorboards subsided to a faint, comforting glow before winking out. The ordinary, dusty hum of the Elara's Relics & Repairs did not return. A deeper, more profound quiet settled in its place, thrumming with spent power and shock.

Elara slumped, exhaustion weighing her bones like lead. Kaelen slid down the wall, staring at his hands. Silas coalesced into a solid, seated form on the counter, head in his hands. From the pile of plaster, a deep, rhythmic tick-tock, tick-tock began, and Argus’s ocular lens flickered back to a dim, steady blue.

“Core stability… at eight percent,” he groaned. “But stable.”

They had held.

Elara forced herself to stand, her legs trembling. She walked to the empty window frame, looking out at the three agents picking themselves up in the twilight street. The leader met her gaze from across the distance, her expression unreadable. After a long moment, she gave another sharp nod, and the squad retreated, melting into the gathering shadows.

The victory felt hollow, fragile. They were safe, but the sanctuary had been violated. The world outside knew where they were.

As she turned back, a glint of copper on the floor near the toppled footstool caught her eye. She bent, her back protesting, and picked it up. It was a small, disc-like device, no larger than a button, etched with fine, spiraling lines. It was still warm, and it emitted a faint, sub-audible hum that set her teeth on edge.

“Silas,” she said, her voice hoarse.

The ghost floated over. He looked at the device and his form rippled with disgust. “A tracker. Resonance-based. It keys to the unique magical signature of a place… or a person. Now that it’s activated here, they’ll always be able to find this spot.” He looked at her, his spectral eyes grave. “They didn’t come just to retrieve us. They came to mark the nest.”

Elara closed her fist around the device. The copper was slick against her skin. She looked around her Elara's Relics & Repairs—at the shattered window, the dust, the scorch marks from the null-fields, the heroic, broken forms of her friends.

Kaelen was tending to Argus, using a torn strip of his own shirt to wipe plaster from the golem’s joints. Silas was already drifting toward the workshop, muttering about finding a way to contain the tracker’s signal. Argus’s steady ticking was a metronome counting their borrowed time.

This wasn’t an end. It was a threshold.

Elara walked to the front door, its frame splintered from the force of the rejection wave. She placed the copper disc on the counter, a deliberate, ugly centerpiece. She met the eyes of each of them—the cursed, the dead, the dying, the mender.

“We can’t remove it without them knowing,” she said, the steel returning, tempered now in the fire of the attack. “And we can’t run. This is the place that remembered how to protect us.” She took a deep breath, the air still tasting of ozone and resolve. “So we stay. We fortify. We mend what we can, and we learn to guard what we’ve built.”

She looked at the tracker, then back at her fledgling team.

“The Elara's Relics & Repairs is closed,” Elara Vess declared, her words settling into the new quiet, not as an end, but as a beginning. “As of today, this is no longer just a business.” She let her gaze sweep over the broken window, the wounded guardian, the weary faces. “This is a safehouse.”
