Chapter 10: Gathering the Broken

The air in the war room tasted of chalk dust, strong tea, and a new, sharp desperation. The Harvest List—a scroll of damningly elegant script—lay unfurled across the scarred oak table, weighted at its corners by a chipped mug, a river-smooth stone, and Silas’s trembling hand. The faint scent of old parchment and leather wafted from the pages, a reminder of the countless nights he'd spent pouring over these records, searching for any hint of weakness in Aethelgard's seemingly impenetrable defenses.

“We can’t save them all,” he said, his voice a rasp. The memory of the trap, of the Hollow Mage’s vacant eyes, was a fresh brand on his soul. The image of those empty sockets haunted him still, a constant reminder of the horrors he'd witnessed. The weight of his failure pressed down on him, making his shoulders slump beneath the worn leather of his coat.

Elara, standing by the cold hearth, looked paler than usual. The effort of repairing Argus’s shattered leg and weaving new, stronger wards into the very bones of the house had left violet smudges beneath her eyes, a permanent tremor in her fingers. She'd confessed it to Kaelen in the dark of the kitchen: every major mending now cost her a sliver of her own life-force, a tiny, permanent dimming. The pain was a constant companion, a reminder of the sacrifices she made for the people she loved.

“Then we spring it on our terms,” she said, her voice soft but carrying. The words were a defiant challenge to the darkness that loomed over them. She'd always been the one to push forward, to drive the group forward, even when the road ahead seemed impossible. Her eyes, a deep, rich brown, shone with a fierce determination, a spark that refused to be extinguished.

Argus, his new leg—a masterful fusion of enchanted oak and clockwork brass—clicking softly with each shift of his weight, leaned over the map of The City. The intricate web of streets and alleys stretched out before him, a complex puzzle waiting to be solved. He pointed a thick finger at a warehouse district on the river’s edge, a secondary Harvesting facility. “We divide their attention. A loud, messy problem here,” he said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. “While the quiet extractions happen here, here, and here.” His finger danced across the map, touching safehouses, lonely alleyways, and forgotten basements where the List’s names were hiding.

Kaelen, sharpening a already-keen blade with methodical strokes, watched Silas. The returned memories were a storm he was still learning to move through. He knew the archive’s layout, its magical security protocols, the arrogant rhythm of its keepers. He knew because he had helped design them, a lifetime ago when he believed in Aethelgard’s gleaming lies. The memories still lingered, a bitter taste in his mouth. He knew the archive’s secrets, and he knew that he'd have to confront them again.

“The list exists in Aethelgard’s records, too. In their central archive. Delete it there, plant false data, and Thorne’s hunting dogs lose the scent,” Kaelen said, his voice a steady, measured tone. The words were a reminder of the risks they took, of the delicate balance between stealth and deception.

Silas met his gaze. The returned memories were a storm he was still learning to move through. He knew the archive’s layout, its magical security protocols, the arrogant rhythm of its keepers.

“It’s warded with identity-locks. Keyed to senior syndicate members,” Silas echoed, the past tense heavy. The words were a reminder of the life he'd left behind, of the person he used to be. His magical signature... it’s broken. Changed. It might not work. Or it might trigger every alarm they have.

Elara pushed off from the hearth. Her eyes met Silas’s, and for a moment, they just looked at each other. The air was thick with unspoken words, with the weight of their shared secrets. She walked to him, placing her hands on either side of his head. Her touch was fever-warm, a gentle caress that soothed his frayed nerves. “I can’t mend what’s not there, but I can weave a temporary facsimile. A glamour of your old self, layered over your new one. It will hold for an hour, maybe less. And it will hurt.”

Silas didn’t flinch. He knew the pain that came with every glamour, the temporary cost of his own life-force. But he also knew that it was a risk worth taking. He needed to get into the archive, to delete the list and plant false data. Without it, they'd be walking into a trap, a deadly snare that would ensnare them all.

The process was not like the gentle knitting of flesh or wood. It was an assault of sensation, a violent stitching of a ghost onto his living skin. He smelled ozone and old parchment, felt the phantom weight of fine robes, the arrogant straightness of a spine that had never been broken. When it was done, he gasped, his own reflection in the window a stranger’s—a younger, harder, cruelly handsome man staring back with his eyes.

“You look like a prick,” Argus grunted, breaking the tension. The words were a jarring reminder of the man he used to be, of the person he'd become. Silas smiled, a ghost of a smile that hinted at the pain he'd endured.

A ghost of a smile touched Silas’s lips. “I was.”

The rescues began at the witching hour, under a blanket of drizzling rain that smelled of wet stone and distant ozone. The air was heavy with the scent of wet earth and decaying leaves, a reminder of The City's dark, hidden corners. The rescues began at the witching hour, under a blanket of drizzling rain that smelled of wet stone and distant ozone.

Kaelen and Elara took the first target: a chimera held in a private menagerie near the merchant’s quarter. The creature was listed as “Non-viable. Mismatched. Aggressive.” They found her in a steam-wreathed conservatory, curled in a cage of gilded iron. She was a heartbreaking patchwork: the sleek, powerful hindquarters of a lioness, the delicate, feathered wings of a great owl, and the front half of a young woman, her face etched with pain and fury. One of her wings was twisted, molting.

“He bought me for the wings,” she hissed, her voice a rough melody. “Said they’d make a lovely cloak. Changed his mind when they wouldn’t stop shedding.” The words were a bitter reminder of the cruelty that lurked in the shadows, of the monsters that preyed on the weak.

Elara’s hands glowed as she worked on the complex lock, not with brute force, but with persuasion, convincing the metal it was tired, that it wished to unbend. Kaelen stood guard, his senses stretched thin. The extraction was smooth, silent. The chimera—who gave her name as Lyra—limped between them through the rainy streets, her good wing sheltering Elara. She didn’t speak again, but a low, thrumming purr vibrated from her lion’s chest.

Across The City, Argus was making noise. His diversion was a symphony of chaos. He led a handful of the safehouse’s more combative residents—a surly earth-elemental with knuckles of granite, a pair of twin sprites who specialized in discordant, ear-splitting shrieks—against the riverfront facility. They didn’t aim to destroy it, but to be undeniable. Argus’s new leg slammed into warehouse doors, buckling them. The elemental caused the cobblestones to erupt in a jagged fence. The sprites shattered every window with a crescendo of sound. Alarms blared, crimson magical flares shot into the sky, and Thorne’s guards scrambled toward the river, just as planned.

In the frantic shadow of that diversion, other teams moved. They plucked a vampire named Ren from a sanitarium, a gaunt, elegant man who shuddered at the smell of the blood offered to him and lived on a careful diet of rare mushrooms and sun-infused wine. They found a young sylph trapped in a glass bottle, her wind-magic reduced to a faint, despairing whistle. Each rescue was a heartbeat of terror, a snatched breath, then a frantic sprint toward the warren of streets that led home.

Meanwhile, Silas and Kaelen moved through a different kind of darkness: the sterile, hallowed halls of the Aethelgard Archive. The glamour held, a sickening second skin. Silas walked with his old gait, a confident, dismissive stride that made junior archivists scuttle out of his way. The identity-lock on the central archive was a formidable barrier, one that required a specific key to bypass. Silas knew the key, knew the sequence of symbols and gestures that would unlock the door. He knew because he had helped design them, a lifetime ago when he believed in Aethelgard’s gleaming lies.

The air was heavy with the scent of old parchment and dust, a reminder of the countless hours he'd spent pouring over these records. The silence was oppressive, a physical presence that pressed down on him. He knew the archive’s secrets, and he knew that he'd have to confront them again.
