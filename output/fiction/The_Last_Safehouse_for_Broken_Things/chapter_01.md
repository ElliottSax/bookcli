Chapter 1: The Mender’s Touch

Dust in Elara's Relics & Repairs didn’t float; it settled. A patient, deliberate thing, that soft grey blanket lay over a century of discarded memories. Lemon oil, old paper, and the faint, metallic tang of regret scented the air. Here, in the perpetual twilight, broken things came to wait. Not for love, necessarily, but for respect. For someone to acknowledge their scars before shelving them, silent and stoic, among the ranks of the beautifully obsolete.

Elara herself was a creature of this quiet kingdom. At thirty-two, her hands mapped a history of nicks and silver scars, her brown hair perpetually pulled back in a practical twist that had long since given up on being tidy. Weathered slate-coloured eyes held a default expression of gentle skepticism. She believed in the integrity of dovetail joints, the honesty of hand-blown glass, the story told by wear on a handle. Magic, however, held no belief for her. Not anymore. Beyond the grimy bay window lay a world of sleek surfaces and disposable everything—magic enough, and of a hollow, predatory kind.

A jangle from the bell above the door, a sound like a cracked teacup, drew her gaze from the disembodied guts of a 1920s mantel clock. Framed in the doorway, backlit by the damp, grey afternoon, stood a woman. Mousy and wrapped in a beige coat two sizes too large, she buried her hands deep in its pockets. Her eyes darted from a spindly whatnot shelf to a stuffed parrot under a glass dome, never landing anywhere for long.

“Can I help you?” Elara’s voice rasped from disuse. Live customers were rare.

“I was told you fix things.” The woman’s words barely whispered out. A hesitant step inside made the floorboard creak a protest. “Not just… make them look nice. But fix them. Properly.”

“Function is what I restore, where I can.” Elara wiped her hands on her canvas apron. “Some breaks go too deep. Sometimes the part is gone. No miracles here.”

The word ‘miracles’ made the woman flinch. Shuffling forward, she drew a small object from the cavernous pocket of her coat, wrapped in faded velvet cloth. With the reverence of someone handling a holy relic, she placed it on the counter between them.

“This,” the woman said, unwrapping the cloth. “Can you fix this?”

A music box. Six inches square, rosewood, inlaid with a simple pattern of mother-of-pearl stars clouded by age. Humble, unremarkable, the kind of thing that might have sat on a boarding house dresser for fifty years. One tiny brass foot was missing. The lid bore a deep, ugly scratch.

Elara picked it up. Too light.

“The mechanism?”

“It hasn’t played in my lifetime.” Pale fingers knotted together, wringing. “It’s… important. A family piece.”

A lie hid in that pause. Everyone lied about sentiment here, calling things ‘heirlooms’ to justify repair costs or cloak their own inexplicable attachments. It didn’t matter. Attachment was a currency she understood.

“I’ll need to open it. Inspection is fifty. More if I can fix it. No guarantees.” Her standard speech.

The woman nodded with a jerky, bird-like vigour. “Yes. Please. Just… be gentle with it.”

At her workbench—an island of ordered chaos under a green-shaded lamp—Elara laid the box down. The woman followed, hovering a few feet away like a nervous ghost. Elara tuned her out, entering the focused silence of her work. With her magnifying headset donned, she began the delicate task of lifting the hinged lid without stressing the old wood.

The inside disappointed. No intricate dancing figurines, no mirrored interior. Just a plain, dark space housing a simple brass comb and cylinder mechanism, furred with dust and tarnish. The scratch on the lid went right through, a vicious gouge. Tilting it under the light revealed something else: faint, hair-line fractures radiating from the scratch across the entire interior, a spider-web of damage that defied logic. The blow hadn’t just marred the surface; it had sent a shockwave through the very essence of the box.

“Odd,” she murmured.

“What is it?” The woman’s breath was suddenly at her shoulder.

“Structural stress. Unusual pattern.”

Elara reached for her tools: a fine probe, a soft brush. Her routine was a liturgy. Clean first. Diagnose second. She began brushing dust from the mechanism. As she did, her calloused, stained thumb brushed against the edge of an internal fracture.

A jolt went through her—not electricity, but sensation. A cold, sharp ache, like touching a toothache made physical. Her breath caught.

The woman went very still. “You felt that?” A whisper, not a question, but a confirmation.

“Static,” Elara lied, her heart thudding against her ribs. She tried to pull her hand away, but couldn’t. A deep, instinctual compulsion held her there. Her thumb pressed more firmly against the cracked wood. The cold ache intensified, and with it came a whisper of… music. Not a tune, but the ghost of one, a single, sustained, mournful note that existed only in the bones of her hand.

Her hands knew what to do before her mind did. This was her ritual, after all. Clean. Diagnose. Mend. She reached not for glue, but for a pot of her own blending—a beeswax and resin amalgam, infused with powdered oak gall and a hint of lavender for stability. Warming a dab on a palette knife, she began, with the tip of a needle, to trace the hairline fractures underneath. She introduced the mending compound into the hidden wounds, working not just on the wood, but on the break, following its path with an empathy that felt suddenly alien and profound. As she worked, a warmth bloomed under her fingers, seeping through the cold ache. The faint, mournful note in her bones shifted, softened, resolving into a fragment of a lullaby. The clouded mother-of-pearl stars on the lid seemed to clear, just a little, catching the lamplight with a soft inner glow. She lost track of time. The world shrank to the path of the fracture, the flow of the wax, the song of the wood. Finally, the last hidden crack was filled. The sense of cold, splintered pain was gone, replaced by a gentle, humming warmth. Exhaustion, sudden and deep, washed over her. She sat back, pulling her hands away. They were trembling. The music box sat on the bench, whole. “Now for the mechanism,” she said, her voice rough. She reached for the winding key, which was tucked in a slot on the side. Before she could touch it, the woman’s hand shot out and gripped her wrist. Her touch was icy. “Don’t,” the woman pleaded. “Just… just the box. You’ve mended the box.” Elara frowned. “The mechanism is simple. A clean and oil—” “Please.” The raw fear in the woman’s voice silenced her. Elara nodded, withdrawing. The woman released her, then reached out with a trembling hand and turned the key herself. Three precise winds. A click. A whir. The music box began to play. The tune was simple, ancient, a folk melody that spoke of hearths and hidden valleys. But the sound… the sound was not metallic. It was crystalline, airy, as if the notes were being formed from light and dust motes. And from the now-glossy rosewood interior, a soft, gold-white light began to pulse in time with the music. Something stirred inside the light. A small shape, no bigger than Elara’s thumb, uncurled. It was vaguely humanoid, with luminous, moth-like wings that were torn and crumpled. Its skin was the colour of walnut shell, and one of its legs was bent at a sickening angle. It was a house-sprite, a domestic spirit from tales grandmothers told to children. Tales Elara had dismissed as charming nonsense. The sprite blinked large, opalescent eyes. It looked at its own leg, then flexed it. The bend straightened with a soft snick. It stretched its wings; the tears knitted themselves back together as the light from the box washed over it. The sprite let out a tiny, shuddering sigh of relief, a sound like a wind chime in a gentle breeze. Then it turned its gaze to Elara. It bowed, deeply. The music wound down. The light faded, but did not entirely vanish, leaving a soft, pearlescent sheen on the wood. The sprite remained, perched on the edge of the box, looking at Elara with an intelligence that was both ancient and deeply grateful. Elara’s mind was a white, roaring static. She stared from the sprite to the woman, whose anxious face had transformed. The mousy demeanour was gone, replaced by a fierce, hopeful relief. “You are a Mender,” the woman said, the words a reverent exhalation. “What… what is this?” Elara managed. “A test. A hope.” The woman reached into her coat again and pulled out a small, cloth-wrapped bundle, placing it next to the now-glowing music box. “My name is Anya. I was sent by the Network. We’ve been searching for someone with your… affinity. For a long time.” Elara’s cynicism came clawing back, a survival instinct. “Network. Right. Is this a cult? Because I’m not interested in worshipping garden gnomes.” Anya almost smiled. “Not a cult. A community. A hiding place. For things like this.” She gestured to the sprite, who was now polishing its healed wing with fastidious care. “And for those who are… broken, in other ways. By The City. By the Takers.” The word landed in the Elara's Relics & Repairs quiet with the weight of a tombstone. The sprite froze, its tiny body going rigid with fear. “Takers?” “They are the reason magic is a fairy tale,” Anya said, her voice dropping. “They don’t like loose ends. Or things that shine with a light they can’t control. They’ve been… harvesting. For decades. Silencing. What’s left of the magical world is shattered, hidden, or trapped in broken vessels.” She nodded at the music box. “That was a prison and a sanctuary. You didn’t just fix the wood. You healed the sanctuary. And in doing so, you healed its occupant.” Elara looked at her hands. The same hands that had glued countless chair legs and re-strung countless beads. They tingled with a residual warmth. The memory of the cold, splintered ache was already fading, replaced by the echo of that resolved lullaby. A wild, impossible hope, one she had buried as a child, stirred in her chest. It was immediately smothered by a wave of cold, practical terror. “I fix antiques,” she stated, firmly. “I don’t want any part of this.” “You already are,” Anya said softly. She nudged the new bundle towards Elara. “This is a Ward-Cage. Or it was. It’s broken. Its owner didn’t survive the taking. It is… screaming, silently. It needs a safe place to be silent. It needs to be near someone whose touch doesn’t hurt. Just keep it. Hide it. That’s all we ask.” Elara didn’t touch the bundle. She could feel something from it now, a faint, discordant vibration that set her teeth on edge. A silent scream. “Why me?” “Because you see the break, not just the damage,” Anya said. “You care for the story of the fracture. That is the heart of Mending. We’ve been watching. The careful way you handle the loot from estate sales, the pieces no one else wants. You listen. And today, you proved you can hear.” The sprite, with a buzz of its mended wings, flitted from the music box and landed on Elara’s shoulder. It was no heavier than a fallen leaf. It nestled against her neck, a tiny point of warmth. “It likes you,” Anya said. “It’s chosen you. It won’t go back in the box now.” “Great,” Elara muttered, but she didn’t shake it off. The warmth was… not unpleasant. Anya left then, after pressing a roll of ordinary-looking cash into Elara’s hand—the inspection fee, she said, for a job wonderfully done. She left the music box, now a functioning home for a sprite who refused to use it. She left the Ward-Cage, wrapped and screaming on the counter. She left Elara’s world cracked open. The rest of the day passed in a surreal haze. Elara hid the Ward-Cage bundle in the old, defunct safe behind a loose wall panel in her back room. Its discordant vibration dampened as soon as it was enclosed in iron and brick, becoming a barely perceptible hum. The sprite, whom she found herself calling “Wisp” for the light it occasionally shed, explored the Elara's Relics & Repairs, leaving tiny footprints in the dust on high shelves, humming contentedly. As dusk stained The City streets purple and gold, Elara closed up. She turned off the lights, locked the door, and stood in the familiar, comforting dark of her kingdom. But it didn’t feel the same. The dust seemed watchful. The shadows held shapes. The memory of warmth in her The figure across the street went rigid. Its head snapped towards her Elara's Relics & Repairs. Though she could see no eyes, she felt the full, crushing weight of its attention. It had sensed the Cage’s flinch. It had sensed her.

Then, with a smooth, unnerving grace, it raised one of those too-long hands. It didn’t point at the Elara's Relics & Repairs, but directly at the window of her darkened apartment above. A deliberate, unmistakable designation. I know where you live. Then it melted into the alley, gone.

Elara stood frozen, her heart a trapped bird against her ribs. Wisp zipped down, trembling violently in her hair. “Mender,” it chimed, a whisper of pure panic. “The Mender is found. The Takers are coming for the broken things.”

She stumbled to the back room, to the safe. The Ward-Cage was still. But nestled against its fractured bars, where no object had been before, lay a single item. A small, porcelain doll’s hand, impossibly pristine. It was a perfect match to the one she’d mended that afternoon for the little girl from the bakery. The hand she had sealed with a ward of protection.

That ward was now scorched black, utterly broken. The Takers hadn’t just found her. They had left a receipt.
