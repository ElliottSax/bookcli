Chapter 7: The Hollow Mage

CHAPTER SEVEN: THE HOLLOW MAGE

The rain over the city’s industrial graveyard wasn’t water. It was a fine, greasy mist of alchemical runoff and despair, settling on rusted iron and shattered glass like a shroud. Elara stood in the lee of a collapsed smokestack, the cold seeping through her patched coat, and watched the warehouse. It was a hulking silhouette against the perpetual twilight of the city’s smog, one wall gaping open like a rotten tooth.

“Too quiet,” Kael muttered, shifting beside her. The wiry street-thief was a knot of nervous energy, his fingers dancing over the hilts of his knives. “Even for a dead place.”

“It’s not dead,” rumbled Argus. The war-golem stood like a bastion behind them, the low hum of his patched power-core vibrating through the wet ground. His single ocular lens, a warm amber, cycled through magnifications. “There are heat signatures. Four. Stationary. One… fluctuating. In the center bay.”

The fluctuating one was their target. A Hollow Mage. The term was Aethelgard’s cruel poetry. It meant a magic-user whose innate power had been forcibly siphoned, drained to the dregs to fuel their corporate engines or their weapons. The intelligence, whispered through Kael’s underground channels, was that this one had been left behind at a temporary processing site, too weak to move. A discarded tool. The safehouse needed information, a glimpse inside Aethelgard’s ever-evolving machinery. A Hollow Mage, if they could reach them in time, might still hold fragments of that knowledge.

Silas, a darker shadow against the gloom, lowered his own monocular. His face, usually a mask of sardonic calm, was taut. “The signatures are too clean. Too placed. This is a textbook perimeter guard setup.”

“But the mage is there,” Elara said, her voice firmer than she felt. The memory of the recent attack on her shop—the sizzle of containment spells against her wards, the shouts, the smell of ozone and fear—was a fresh bruise. They needed this win. They needed to prove they could strike back, even in a small way. “We can’t leave them. We go in quiet, we get them out. That’s the job.”

Silas’s eyes met hers. In the murky light, they held a warning, a memory of other operations gone sour. But he simply gave a curt nod. “Quiet, then. Kael, disable the external sentry glyphs. Argus, you’re our wall. Elara, be ready to counter any active bindings. I’ll take point.”

Kael melted into the shadows, a ghost in the rain. They watched as he approached the warehouse’s perimeter, a set of faintly glowing runes etched into the mud. With delicate, precise movements, he applied a tarry substance from a vial, smothering the magic before it could scream an alarm. He gave a sharp, bird-like whistle. All clear.

They moved as one unit, a strange, cobbled-together creature of stealth and strength. Through the jagged maw of the wall, into the cavernous, echoing belly of the warehouse. The air inside was thick with the smells of damp concrete, old oil, and something sharper, metallic and wrong—the ozone-taint of spent magic.

High above, broken skylights let in columns of grimy light, illuminating swirling dust motes and the four Aethelgard sentries. They were clad in grey tactical gear, standing rigid at the cardinal points of the central bay, their faces obscured by mirrored visors. They didn’t move. Between them, slumped in a chair of twisted rebar, was the mage.

Elara’s breath hitched. They were so small. A figure wrapped in a threadbare grey robe, head bowed, long silver hair hanging lank. A faint, sickly pallor emanated from them, the last ghost of a once-bright aura. The Hollow Mage.

Silas gestured with sharp hand signals. Argus, north guard. Kael, south. Elara, west with me. Non-lethal. Go.

It was terrifyingly smooth. Argus crossed the distance with a speed that belied his size, a low whine from his servos the only sound. His massive fist closed around the north guard’s helmet and connected with a support column with a dull crunch. The guard slid down, unconscious. Kael was a blur, his sap catching the south guard perfectly behind the ear. Elara and Silas moved in unison on the west guard; a spark of her binding magic wrapped around his legs as Silas’s precise jab to a nerve cluster dropped him like a sack.

The east guard turned, raising a shock-rod, but Argus was already there. One hand engulfed the weapon, crushing it, the other pinning the man to the ground with careful, immense pressure. The guard went still.

Silence, broken only by the drip of water and the thud of Elara’s heart. They’d done it. No alarms. No screams.

She rushed to the chair. “We’re here to help,” she whispered, her hands glowing with a soft, green-tinged light—a simple diagnostic charm. “You’re safe now.”

The figure stirred. The head lifted slowly.

The face was… beautiful. And utterly empty. It was like a porcelain mask of a young man, flawless and serene. But the eyes were the worst. Not hollow, but full—full of a swirling, captive light, like a storm trapped in a jar. There was no recognition, no pain, no relief. Just that eerie, swirling luminescence.

“Oh, no,” Silas breathed, the words a punch of pure dread. “It’s a Lure.”

The word meant nothing to Elara for a heartbeat. Then the Lure smiled. It was a small, polite smile.

“Thank you for coming,” it said, its voice a chorus of whispering echoes. “Authentication confirmed. Welcome, Safehouse.”

The world erupted in a silent, violet blast.

It wasn’t fire or force. It was a suppression field, a wave of pure anti-magic that unwove the world. Elara’s diagnostic charm snuffed out like a candle in a gale. Every rune on her person went dark and cold. She felt her own innate magic, the warm, stubborn wellspring inside her, recoil and flatten, pressed down by an immense, smothering weight. Kael cried out, stumbling as his subtle glamours—the ones that helped him blend and hide—were ripped away. Silas gasped, his own complex inner wards shattering with a sound only he could hear.

The Lure’s body began to crack, light bleeding from the fissures.

The four “guards” they’d subdued dissolved into puddles of shimmering, mercury-like goo. From the shadows of the rafters, real figures dropped, six of them, clad in the sleek black of Aethelgard’s elite retrieval corps, their faces covered by breathing apparatuses, weapons humming with restrained energy. The trap was sprung.

“Contain them!” a voice barked, electronically modulated.

The suppression field was a physical pressure, making the air thick as syrup. Elara tried to raise a shield, but her magic was sludge, unresponsive. A retrieval agent lunged for her, a containment coil glowing in his hand.

A wall of scarred ceramic and steel slammed down between them.

Argus.

The suppression field crippled magic, not muscle. It didn’t touch the ancient, stubborn physics of his construction, nor the fierce, non-magical will that animated him. He moved now not with golem-silence, but with the deafening, glorious rage of a fortress on the offensive. He grabbed a steel I-beam that had fallen from the roof and swung it like a bat, catching two agents and sending them flying into the darkness.

“ELARA! THE DOOR!” he roared, his voice the sound of grinding millstones.

She stumbled, her body heavy and wrong without her magic. Kael was at her side, pulling her arm, his own face pale with the shock of being truly, physically seen. Silas was covering their retreat, firing a non-magical pneumatic dart gun with lethal accuracy, catching an agent in the thigh.

The Lure was glowing brighter, a star about to go nova. The suppression field intensified, the violet light pulsing. It was going to detonate. Not to kill, Elara realized with icy clarity. To permanently brand. To mark them with a magical residue so potent, so unique, Aethelgard would be able to track them to the ends of the earth.

“We can’t outrun the pulse!” Silas shouted, his voice strained.

Argus turned from his defensive position. He looked at the cracking, radiant Lure. He looked at the huddled forms of his comrades—the tinker, the thief, the traitor. His family, now.

His single amber lens fixed on Elara. He gave a single, slow nod.

Then he turned and charged toward the Lure.

“ARGUS, NO!” Elara screamed.

He didn’t stop. He crossed the distance in three earth-shaking strides and wrapped his massive body around the construct, curling over it like a parent over a child, his back to the group, his arms forming a solid cage of stone and metal.

The Lure exploded.

There was no sound. Only a blinding, violet-white light that filled the universe. The wave of force that followed was magical, not kinetic, but it still hurled Elara, Kael, and Silas off their feet and through the warehouse opening, out into the mud and the rain.

She scrambled up, ears ringing, magic still dead within her. “Argus!”

The warehouse was dark. The violet light was gone. The suppression field was down, her magic rushing back in a painful, tingling flood. She ran back inside, Silas and Kael at her heels.

He was in the center of the bay, on his knees. Smoke, real and acrid, curled from his chassis. His back was a ruin of blackened ceramic and melted steel. And his left arm—the powerful, articulate limb he used to mend clockwork and lift beams—was gone. Not damaged. Gone, from the shoulder down. The edges of the socket were fused and glowing a dull, molten red. The arm itself lay several feet away, a twisted, unrecognizable sculpture of slag and dead magic.

The Lure was utterly vaporized. Of the retrieval agents, there was no sign; they’d vanished the moment the trap was triggered.

“Argus…” Elara fell to her knees before him, her hands hovering over the catastrophic damage. His ocular lens was dim, flickering.

“Pulse… contained,” he grated, his voice box crackling with static. “Trace magic… on me. Not you. Go.”

“We’re not leaving you,” Silas said, his voice raw. He and Kael moved to Argus’s side, slinging his remaining arm over their shoulders. “Up. Now.”

Somehow, they got the three-ton golem moving, a desperate, lurching retreat through the industrial wastes, expecting pursuit with every step. It never came. Aethelgard didn’t need to chase. Their trap had worked perfectly.

**

The back room of The Last Safehouse for Broken Things was no longer a workshop. It was an emergency ward, and the air tasted of panic and hot metal.

Argus was seated on the reinforced floor, his back against the strongest wall, his systems whining in distress. Elara worked with a frantic, focused fury, tools scattered around her. The damage was… it was impossible. The arm wasn’t just severed; the magical corruption from the Lure’s pulse had fused with his core matrix, crawling like crystalline rust from the shoulder socket inward. Every time she tried to clean the wound with a magical solvent, the corruption sparked and spread. She couldn’t cut it out without risking his power-core. She couldn’t contain it. It was a malevolent, intelligent stain, designed to cling and signal.

“I can’t stop it,” she whispered, her voice breaking. Her hands, usually so steady, were shaking. “It’s woven into his foundational glyphs. It’s… it’s calling them. It’s a beacon.”

Kael paced like a caged animal, his knives in his hands. “Then we dig it out. We take the core and run.”

“The corruption is attached to the core, you idiot!” Silas snapped, leaning over Elara’s shoulder, his face ashen. “Removing it might kill him instantly. And if it doesn’t, they’ll follow the core. This isn’t just a tracking spell. It’s a claim marker*. It says ‘Aethelgard property.’ It’s broadcasting our location on a frequency only they can hear.”

Argus’s lens focused on Elara. The warm amber was clouded, fading. “Elara.” His voice was a faint echo. “The safehouse… is compromised. You must… evacuate. Salvage what you can.”

“No,” she said, the word a vow. She pressed her hands against his searing-hot chassis, pouring every ounce of her healing, mending magic into him. It was like trying to hold back the tide with a broom. The corruption drank it in and grew brighter, a faint, ugly violet glow pulsing deep within his chest. A lighthouse for their enemies.

“The wards,” Kael said, desperate. “Can’t we… mask it? Overload it?”

“It’s designed to bypass wards,” Silas said, running a hand through his hair. He stared at the pulsing corruption, his eyes narrowed not in fear, but in a dawning, horrified recognition. “It’s a resonant signature. Self-replicating. I’ve… I’ve seen this work before. Not this exact application, but the principle. The elegance of the malice.”

He fell silent, his gaze locked on the rhythmic, violet pulse. It was a pattern. A signature.

Elara saw the change in his face. The color drained completely, leaving him looking like a ghost. His breath caught. The gritty resolve, the weary cynicism—it all fell away, revealing a raw, unhealed wound beneath.

“Silas?” she asked.

He didn’t seem to hear her. He took a step closer to Argus, his hand reaching out, not to touch, but to trace the pattern of the light in the air. His lips moved soundlessly.

“What is it?” Kael demanded. “Do you know how to stop it?”

Silas’s hand dropped. He looked from the corruption in Argus’s chest to his own hands, as if seeing them for the first time. When he finally spoke, his voice was hollow, stripped of all its usual layers, filled with a warmly melancholic horror.

“I know who made it,” he said.

The room went still. Even Argus’s systems seemed to quiet.

Silas looked at Elara, his eyes full of a terrible, shared understanding. “The Lure. The corruption. The elegance. It’s her work. She always loved elegant traps.”

“Who?” Elara asked, though a part of her already knew, already felt the chill of the answer.

Silas’s next words were a whisper, a confession, and a death knell for their fragile safety all at once.

“Lyra,” he said. “My former superior. My mentor. The one who trained me in Aethelgard’s Artifice Division.” He swallowed, the sound loud in the quiet room. “She’s not just hunting us. She’s laying out a welcome mat. She knows I’m here. And she wants me to know she’s coming.”

Outside, in the perpetual twilight of the city, the first notes of a distant, synchronized alarm began to wail, sweeping towards the district. The beacon in Argus’s chest pulsed once, brightly, in time with the sirens.
