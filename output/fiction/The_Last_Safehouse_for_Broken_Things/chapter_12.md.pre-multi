Chapter 12: What We Mend, We Become

The air in the shop tasted of ozone, burnt herbs, and fear. The beautiful, cluttered chaos of The Last Safehouse was now a battlefield’s debris field. Overturned shelves spilled jars of whispering moss and calming salts. The gentle hum of mended things was gone, replaced by the sharp crackle of defensive wards straining under assault and the guttural shouts of Aethelgard’s Enforcers in the street.

Elara leaned against the reinforced doorframe of the back workshop, her breath a ragged saw in her chest. Her hands, usually stained with tea and tarnish, were smeared with Kaelen’s silvery, sap-like blood from a glancing blade wound she’d just sealed. The cost of that simple mend was a throbbing void behind her eyes, a hollow ache that seemed to drink the light from the room.

“They’re falling back to regroup,” Kaelen grunted, peering through a shattered windowpane. His wooden form was scored with blackened cuts, but he stood firm, a staff of iron-hard oak in his grip. “For now.”

Argus clanked over, his pot-body dented, one copper arm hanging limp. His single eye-lens whirred, focusing on Elara. “Your vital signs are sub-optimal, Mistress Elara. You have exceeded recommended capacity for thaumaturgic expenditure.”

“No time for optimal,” Elara whispered, offering a faint smile. The little automaton had been magnificent, his kettle-whistle scream disorienting attackers, his surprising strength throwing back men twice his size. He was no longer just a mended thing; he was a defender.

From the main room, nestled among overturned furniture and the protective circle of the strongest remaining wards, the safehouse’s newest residents huddled. A young girl with hair that flickered like candle flame held a small, fox-like creature whose shadow moved independently of its body. An old man whose skin occasionally phased into translucent, bark-like texture comforted a weeping woman whose tears pooled and froze into tiny, perfect crystals on the floor. They were the rescued, the “defective,” the beautiful, broken things Thorne wanted to grind into fuel. Their eyes, wide with terror, were fixed on Elara. She was the lock on the door. She was the final thread.

The front door exploded inward.

Not with brute force, but with a silent, corrosive wave of null-magic. The wards didn’t shatter; they dissolved, un-stitched at a fundamental level. The intricate carvings over the doorway flaked into dust. Through the smoke and settling plaster walked Director Silas Thorne.

He looked different than he had in his pristine office. Here, in the heart of the messy, living resistance, he seemed both more real and more terrible. His fine coat was dusted with debris, his face a mask of cold, surgical focus. In his hands, he held not a weapon, but a device. It was a refined, horrifying version of the harvester Elara had seen in his lab: a lattice of brass and pale blue crystal, pulsing with a hungry, rhythmic light. At its heart sw
