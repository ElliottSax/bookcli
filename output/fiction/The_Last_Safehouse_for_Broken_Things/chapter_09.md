## **Chapter 9: The Cost of Mending**

The heart of Elara’s Relics & Repairs, usually a symphony of ticking clocks, whispering gears, and the soft, percussive tap of her own tools, was silent. A thick, listening silence had fallen, broken only by the ragged saw of her own breathing and the faint, discordant hum emanating from Argus’s exposed core. It was the sound of a heart arrhythmia translated into crystal and ether, a sound that set Elara’s teeth on edge and vibrated unpleasantly in the hollow of her chest.
The automaton lay sprawled across the great, scarred oak worktable, the table’s surface stained by decades of oil, acid, and ambition. His chest-plate was pried open, a vault of secrets forced ajar. Within lay a labyrinth of fractured crystal conduits, their usual sapphire glow reduced to a sickly, intermittent pulse, like a dying firefly trapped in a maze. The delicate silver filigree that channeled his animating essence was twisted and blackened in places, as if scorched from within. His left arm—the marvel of complex articulation with its hidden compartments and subtle, expressive joints—was a ruin. Sheared metal gleamed dully under the lamplight, a nest of dead, copper wires spilling out like metallic entrails.
A single, guttered lamp on a brass arm cast its feeble, ochre light over the scene, plunging the rest of the shop into deep, velvety shadow. The light caught the edges of tools, the curves of half-finished projects on shelves, transforming them into strange, skeletal shapes. The shadows on the plaster walls were not mere absences of light; they were entities, dark and twisted fingers that appeared to reach out from the corners, yearning to snatch at the fragile light, to consume the broken thing on the table. Elara blinked, forcing the fancy away. *Just shadows*, she told herself. *Just fear.*

The air was a blend of scents, each one a thread in the story of this place. The base note was the familiar, comforting smell of old oil, linseed, and polished wood—the smell of home, of purpose. Layered over it was the sharp, clean tang of ozone, the ghost of released magic. But today, these were overwhelmed by the acrid, throat-clenching stench of burned metal and the faint, coppery tang of something more organic. *Argus’s ichor*, she thought, her stomach clenching. It wasn’t blood, not as humans knew it, but it was his life-fluid all the same, a shimmering, mercury-like substance now congealing in the grooves of the table. The smell was a violation. It spoke of violence done to a system of beautiful, intricate order.
Kaelen stood at her shoulder, a steady, warm presence in the chill of the workshop. He’d dragged a small, charcoal brazier closer, and over its blue flames, a small copper kettle simmered, releasing coils of steam that twisted in the lamplight like phantoms. The steam carried the pungent, earthy aroma of ground moonroot and the faint, sweet decay of whisper-moss—a restorative tea meant to steady nerves and sharpen focus. The scent was a lifeline, a thread of the familiar in the chaos.
She could feel the heat of him beside her, could hear the soft, rhythmic sound of his breathing, a counterpoint to her own frantic tempo. He wasn’t looking at Argus; he was watching *her*. His eyes, usually the colour of a sun-dappled forest floor, were dark with concern, the lines at their corners etched deep by the flickering light. His silence was a question. *Can you do this? What will it take?* She had no answers, only a cold, leaden dread in the pit of her stomach.
By the window, a silhouette against the fog-choked pane, was Silas. The mist outside wasn’t peaceful; it swirled and eddied with a malevolent life of its own, pressing against the glass as if seeking entry. He scanned the empty, grey street, his posture rigid, a sentinel carved from guilt and memory. When he spoke, his voice was flat, stripped of inflection, a report from a past he longed to disown.
“Aethelgard’s Harvesters,” he said, the words dropping into the silence like stones into a still pond. “They target these foci first. The crystalline lattice in the left pectoral housing. Cripple the will, disrupt the coherence of the self. Then the power drain is cleaner, more efficient. Standard extraction protocol.”

Elara’s hands, which had been hovering over the wreckage of Argus’s arm, stilled. The clinical terms—*foci, extraction protocol*—were obscenities. They reduced Argus, with his dry wit and his curious, gentle nature, to a resource. But beneath the flat delivery, she heard the self-loathing, a bass note of horror that vibrated through him. This was remembered knowledge, etched into his bones by the very people who now hunted them. Every fact he recalled was a betrayal of the man he was trying to become.
On the floor, his back against a shelf of orphaned cogs and silent mainsprings, sat Leo. He held his clockwork fox, Flick, in his lap, his tiny, grimy hands moving in slow, repetitive strokes over its brass flank. The fox’s glass eyes were dim, its clever tail still. Leo’s own eyes were fixed on Argus’s face, which was, mercifully, still and placid. The automaton had powered down into a protective stasis the moment the damage became critical. He looked like he was sleeping, if one could ignore the cavern open in his chest.
Leo had appointed himself Argus’s vigil-keeper. He hadn’t spoken since they’d laid the heavy form on the table, but his devotion was a palpable force in the room. It was a tiny, fierce flame of hope. Argus had thrown himself between Leo and the lash of crackling, violet energy from the Harvester’s gauntlet. The memory replayed behind Elara’s eyes: the smell of ozone sharpening to violence, Leo’s cry, the deafening *crunch-crack* as the energy connected not with a child’s fragile body, but with the intricate mechanics of a guardian. The cost of that sacrifice lay before her, a tangled monument of shattered artistry.
“Yes,” Elara said, and the word was more breath than sound, a vow exhaled into the heavy air. She simply didn’t know the price. The responsibility settled onto her shoulders, a physical weight that made the bones in her neck ache. The very atmosphere in the shoto vibrate with a low, inaudible tension, as if the walls, imbued with generations of subtle magic, were straining to contain the magnitude of this breaking.
She knew she could not begin with pliers and solder. This was a wound of essence, not just mechanics. Taking a steadying breath that did little to calm her, she placed her palms flat on the cool, etched brass of Argus’s intact shoulder. The metal was smooth under her skin, alive with a residual, fading warmth. She closed her eyes, shutting out the grim scene, the worried faces, the accusing shadows.
She reached out with the part of her that understood broken things. It was a sense not of sight, but of *resonance*. The workshop around her—its smells, its sounds—faded into a distant murmur. She fell into the echo of the damage.
First, the violent signature of the Harvester’s blow: a searing, crackling violet pain, a pattern of pure destructive negation that had ripped through the delicate pathways. It was like touching the ghost of lightning, a shocking, jagged scar in the fabric of Argus’s being. It still sizzled at the edges, seeking to spread.
But beneath that fresh, screaming injury, she found something older, deeper. A hollow. A sucking void where something integral had been carved out long ago. This was the old wound, the reason Argus had come to her shop in the first place—a missing piece of his core self, harvested. It was a silence where there should have been a hum, a coldness where there should have been warmth. The new damage had agitated that old emptiness, like a hammer blow on a fault line. The void was now actively pulling, draining the flickering energy from his intact systems, threatening to unravel him from the inside out.
*He’s no merely st broken,* she realized with a chill that had nothing to do with the room’s temperature. *He’s unspooling.*

The understanding of what was needed crystallized in her mind, clear, cold, and terrifying. To mend this, to truly stabilize him, she couldn’t just patch the cracks or bypass the burned conduits. She had to address the foundational instability. She had to fill the void. Not with a temporary infusion of borrowed magic, but with something substantial, something that could act as a new anchor for his self.
Her own magic, the gentle, persistent power she used to coax life back into stubborn mechanisms, was rooted in the shop itself. In every nail she’d driven with care, every ward of protection and warmth she’d whispered into the floorboards, every moment of quiet satisfaction she’d while restoring a lost treasure. It was a self-replenishing well, fed by peace and purpose. But it was a well for *mending*, not for *replacing*. It could guide and heal, but it could not become the cornerstone of another being’s soul. To pour it into that hungry void would be to drain the shop—and herself—dry, and it might still not be enough.
She opened her eyes. The world snapped back into brutal focus—the lamplight now seeming harsh, the shadows more defined, the smell of burned metal clawing at her throat. Her gaze found Kaelen’s. He held a chipped clay mug of the steaming tea toward her. In his eyes, she saw that he had followed her inward journey. He saw the dread, the calculation, the dawning, desperate resolve. He knew the shape of sacrifice.
“It’s not enough,” she whispered, her voice hoarse. “My magic… it can guide the repair, but the foundation is gone. He needs an anchor.”

Kaelen’s jaw tightened. He gave a slow, grim nod. He understood the language of essence and anchors. “What do you need, Elara?”

Her eyes travelled from Argus’s still face, over the shelves of curiosities, past Leo’s hunched form, to the front of the shop. To the door. The words formed, heavy and inevitable on her tongue.
“The ward-anchor above the door,” she replied, her voice gaining a sliver of strength. “The keystone.”

The air in the room seemed to older. The keystone was no mere decoration. It was a fist-sized piece of river-smoothed granite, shot through with veins of lapis lazuli, set into the lintel. Elara’s grandfather had found it on the bank of the Silverwash, humming with latent earth-magic. He had bound it, woven the shop’s primary protective and reinforcing wards through it, and set it as the literal and figurative cornerstone of Elara’s Relics & Repairs. It was the reason damp didn’t rot the beams, why casual thieves found their minds wandering elsewhere, why the extremely walls seemethe with a gentle, protective vigilance. It was the heart of the shop’s magic.
Kaelen’s breath hissed out between his teeth. “Elara…”

“I know,” she cut in, the full cost crashing down on her. To remove it would onlyjust be a theft; it would be an amputation. The shop’s wards would fail. Its inherent magic, the very thing that made it a sanctuary, would bleed away. The shadows in the corners might become more than shadows. The fog outside might find a way in. It would make them vulnerable, exposed. She was proposing to trade the safety of all of them, the sanctity of her home, for the chance to save one.
“It’s a piece of a place,” she said, thinking aloud, her mind racing down the paths of theory. “A place that is alive with memory and care. It’s foundational magic. It’s the only object strong enough, *real* enough, to fill that void and give him something to root himself to.” She looked at Argus. “He protected Leo. He protects all of us. His will to do that… it’s worth anchoring.”

Silas turned from the window. His sharp features were pale in the gloom. “It will leave you naked,” he stated, his former flatness gone, replaced by a raw urgency. “Aethelgard’s seekers… they sniff for power. A dimmed ward is a beacon. You’re not just giving something up. You’re painting a target on this entire building.”

“I am aware of the cost, Silas,” Ela answered, a spark of her old fire returning, fueled by fear and determination. “But we cannot leave him like this. He is simplyjust a machine.” She let her hand rest again on Argus’s shoulder. “He is a person. And he is ours.”

The word *ours* hung in the air. It included Silas, the former Harvester. It included Kaelen, the wanderer with his pouches of herbs. It included Leo, the orphan with his broken fox. They had become a fragile, makeshift family in this haven, and Argus was part of it.
Leo glanced up then, his small voice cutting through the tension. “He’s my friend.” It was simple, absolute, and it shattered any last pretense of clinical detachment. This wasn’t about resources or protocol. It was about a friend lying broken on a table.
Kaelen set the mug of tea down on the worktable with a decisive *click*. “Where are your tools for the stone?”

The decision was made. The price would be paid.
Elara fetched the short, brass-handled pry bar and the mallet wrapped in to prevent chipping. Her hands trembled slightly as she took them from their hook. These were tools for deconstruction, an act that went against every instinct in her body. Kaelen dragged the rolling work ladder to the front door.
The climb was only a few steps, but it like an ascent to an altar. The keystone, set in the old, dark oak, was cool to the touch. The lapis veins seemed to glowappeared toaint, inner light as her fingers traced them. She could feel the thrum of the shop’s magic flowing through it, a steady, quiet pulse. *I’m sorry,* she thought, not knowing if she was apologizing to the stone, to her grandfather, or to the shop itself.
She positioned the pry bar. The first tap of the mallet was a soft, mournful sound. The second was louder. On the third, a tiny crack appeared in the old mortar. Feelings of loss, sharp and immediate, washed through her. It was as if she’d struck her own soul.
Down on the table, Argus’s core gave a sudden, weak flutter, the sickly light flaring for a second. Leo gasped. Silas’s hand went to the hilt of his knife, his eyes darting to the window.
“It’s connected,” Elara whispered, horrified. “Of course it is.” The shop his intrusion. She was hurting her home to save her friend. The duality of the act was a physical pain in her chest.
With careful, agonizing precision, she worked the stone loose. A fine dust of ancient mortar sifted down, catching in the lamplight like falling stars. Finally, with a gritty, reluctant sigh, the keystone came free. She caught its weight in her hands. It was heavier than it looked, dense with contained power and history.
The moment it left its setting, a change swept through the shop. It was subtle but profound. The constant, almost subconscious background hum of the wards—a sound she hadn’t even realized she heard until it was gone—ceased. The air, once feeling thick and secure, now thin, common. The lamplight seemed harsher, the shadows deeper and more menacing. The scent of ozone and oil was just smells, no longer underpinned by the warmth of ambient magic. A profound vulnerability settled over the room, a chilling draft on the back of the neck.
Elara descended the ladder, the keystone cradled against her apron like a newborn. Its weight was now the weight of their collective safety. She carried it to the worktable and placed it beside Argus’s open core. The vibrant blue of the lapisgazedd alien against the scorched silver and cracked crystal.
“Now,” she said, her voice trembling only slightly. She placed one hand on the cool granite of the keystone, and the other deep within the wreckage of Argus’s chest, her fingers brushing the edge of the cold, hollow void.
She closed her eyes again. This time, she did not seek to understand the break. She sought to perform a transplant. She poured her awareness into the keystone, feeling the generations of care baked into it: her grandfather’s laughter, her own childhood wonder, the peace of ten thousand quiet nights. She gathered that essence, not taking it, but asking it to *move*.
Then, with a focus that made her head pound and her blood sing in her ears, she gently, meticulously, weave the foundational magic of the stone into the void within Argus. It was not a violent stuffing, but a careful grafting. She imagined roots of lapis light extending into the emptiness, finding purchase, spreading a network of stability. She channelled the memory of the shop’s steadfast walls, its protective embrace, into the core of his being.
Sweat beaded on her forehead and trickled down her spine. The energy transfer was immense. She was a conduit, and it like trying to channel a river through a straw. A sharp, metallic taste filled her mouth. Her knees threatened to buckle. Kaelen’s hand was on her back, a steadying pressure, his own warmth a minor anchor for her in the storm.
On the table, the sickly hum from Argus’s corto change. The discordance smoothed. The weak, intermittent pulse grew stronger, steadier. The new light was different—not the pure sapphire he’d had before, but a deeper, more complex azure, shot through with flecks of earthy gold, the colour of the lapis, the colour of steadfast stone and deep, flowing rivers. It was a slower, more deliberate rhythm, but it was *strong*.
The twisted filigree began st, the metal remembering its true form. The shattered crystals, too far gone to repair, were bypassed by new pathways of solid, glowing light that traced the routes the keystone’s magic forged.
Elara’s breath was coming in ragged gasps. The transfer was nearing completion. She keystone in her hand grow dormerely, just a pretty rock once more. Its magic, its purpose, now lived elsewhere.
With a final, wrenching effort, she sealed the connection. The new, azure-gold light in Argus’s core flared once, brightly, then settled into a calm, constant glow. The hum was now a deep, resonant thrum, the sound of a hearth-fire, of a foundation stone settling.
She snatched her hands back, staggering. Kaelen caught her, guiding her into a stool. Black spots danced at the edge of her vision. She was empty, drained not just of magic, but of something vital. She new silence of the shop around her, a silence that was no longer listening, but simply… absent.
Leo was on his feet, clutching Flick, his eyes wide. Silas had turned fully from the window, his gaze locked on Argus.
For a long moment, nothing happened. Then, with a soft, pneumatic sigh and a series of faint, precise clicks, the sheared metal of Argus’s left arm begaract and re-knit. New filaments, glowing with the same azure-gold light, extended and wove themselves into complex, articulate structures. It was not a repair; it was a rebirth. The new arm that formed was sleeker, stronger, the brass and steel shot through with faint, swirling veins of the same lapis-blue energy.
His optical lenses, dark for hours, flickered. The light that returned to them was the same changed colour—a warm, deep azure, thoughtful and steady. He turned his head, a slow, smooth motion, and looked at Elara.
His voice, when it came, was the same, yet different. A familiar cadence underpinned by a new, foundational resonance. It was the difference between a voice echoing in a wooden hall and one speaking from within a stone keep.
“Elarmurmuredhe said. “The shop… it feels distant.”

Tears, hot and sudden, welled in Elara’s eyes. She nodded, unable to speak. The cost was etched intoincredibly very air, into the new light in his eyes, into the profound vulnerability that now cloaked them all.
Argus sat up, the movement fluid and powerful. He peered at his new arm, flexing the fingers, watching the azure light trace the pathways. He looked at Leo, and a soft, familiar warmth infused his new gaze. Then he stared at the dormant keystone on the table, and finally at the empty, accusing space above the door.
He understood. The cost of his mending was laid bare.
“I see,” he said quietly. The hum of his core deepened, as if in solemn acknowledgement. “Then I shall have to become a very good door indeed.”

The words were meant to be reassuring, but in the new, unwarded silence of Elara’s Relics & Repairs, they sounded less like a promise and more like a prayer. The mending was complete. The reckoning, for all of thonlyhad just begun.
