 in the air, like the sound of a branch snapping under pressure. "This is not a matter of binding. This is a matter of... preservation. Of containment." His voice was a low, urgent whisper, as if he were afraid of being overheard, even though the Elara's Relics & Repairs was empty. "The codex is... unstable."

Elara's fingers tightened around the polishing cloth, her knuckles turning white. She felt a sudden, irrational fear, a primal instinct that told her to run, to flee from the Elara's Relics & Repairs and never look back. But she couldn't. She was rooted to the spot, her feet as heavy as lead, as if the very air around her had solidified, trapping her in place.

"What do you mean, unstable?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. She could feel her heart pounding in her chest, a wild, frantic rhythm that seemed to echo in her ears, like the distant beat of a drum.

Kaelen's eyes flickered towards the box, and for a moment, Elara thought she saw a flicker of fear in their depths. "It is a text that should not exist," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "A text that defies the laws of nature. It is a codex that whispers, that speaks in tongues, that... changes."

Elara's breath caught in her throat. She felt a sudden, overwhelming sense of dread, a cold, creeping fear that seemed to wrap itself around her heart, squeezing it like a vice. She knew, with a certainty that bordered on madness, that this man was not here for a simple repair. He was here for something else, something darker, something that defied all reason and logic.

"What kind of changes?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. She could feel her hands trembling, her fingers twitching as if they were trying to reach out, to touch the box, to see what secrets it held. But she couldn't. She was too afraid.

Kaelen's eyes met hers, and for a moment, she saw a flicker of something in their depths, something that looked like pity, like sorrow, like a deep, abiding regret. "It changes the world around it," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "It changes the people who read it. It changes... everything."

Elara felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew, with a certainty that bordered on madness, that this man was not here for a simple repair. He was here for something else, something darker, something that defied all reason and logic.

"What do you want from me?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. She could feel her heart pounding in the air, a wild, frantic rhythm that seemed to echo in her ears, like the distant beat of a drum.

Kaelen's eyes met hers, and for a moment, she saw a flicker of something in their depths, something that looked like pity, like sorrow, like a deep, abiding regret. "I want you to mend it," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I want you to make it whole again. I want you to... contain it."

Elara's breath hitched. The air in the Elara's Relics & Repairs had thickened, as if the very molecules were pressing in on her, heavy with unspoken dread. She could feel the weight of the lead-lined box, the way it seemed to pull at the fabric of reality itself. The scent of old paper and lemon oil had faded, replaced by something metallic, something that smelled like blood and rust.

"Contain it?" she echoed, her voice barely a whisper. "You mean... seal it?"

Kaelen's lips pressed into a thin line. "Seal it, yes. But not just any seal. A permanent one. A binding that cannot be undone."

Elara's fingers twitched, her nails digging into the soft flesh of her palms. She could feel the phantom ache of the locket's whisper, the way it had hummed against her fingertips, the way it had seemed to pulse with a life of its own. She knew, with a certainty that bordered on madness, that this was no ordinary book.

"What kind of book is it?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. She could feel her heart pounding in her chest, a wild, frantic rhythm that seemed to echo in her ears, like the distant beat of a drum.

Kaelen's eyes met hers, and for a moment, she saw a flicker of something in their depths, something that looked like pity, like sorrow, like a deep, abiding regret. "It is a codex of forbidden knowledge," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "A text that should never have been written. A text that... changes the world."

Elara felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew, with a certainty that bordered on madness, that this man was not here for a simple repair. He was here for something else, something darker, something that defied all reason and logic.

The words hung in the air between them, heavy and charged, like the moment before a storm breaks. Elara could feel the weight of them pressing down on her, the way they seemed to seep into her bones, into the very marrow of her being. She knew, with a certainty that bordered on madness, that this was no ordinary book. This was something else, something darker, something that defied all reason and logic.

She took a deep breath, the scent of old paper and lemon oil filling her lungs, grounding her in the present.
