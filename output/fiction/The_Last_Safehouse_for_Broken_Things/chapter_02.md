in the air, like the sound of a branch snapping under pressure. "This is not a matter of binding. This is a matter of... preservation. Of containment." His voice was a low, urgent whisper, as if he were afraid of being overheard, even though the shop was empty. "The codex is... unstable."

Elara's fingers tightened around the polishing cloth, her knuckles turning white. A sudden, irrational fear, a primal instinct, screamed at her to run, to flee from Elara's Relics & Repairs and never look back. But she couldn't. Her feet were rooted to the spot, as heavy as lead, the very air around her solidified, trapping her in place.
"What do you mean, unstable?" Her voice barely rose above a whisper. Her heart pounded a wild, frantic rhythm that echoed in her ears like the distant beat of a drum.
Kaelen's eyes flickered toward the box, and for a moment, a flicker of fear lived in their depths. "It is a text that should not exist," he said, his voice hushed. "A text that defies the laws of nature. It is a codex that whispers, that speaks in tongues, that... changes."

Elara's gasped. A sudden, overwhelming dread, a cold, creeping fear, wrapped itself around her heart and squeezed like a vice. With a certainty that bordered on madness, she knew this man was not here for a simple repair. He was here for something else, something darker, something that defied all reason and logic.
"What kind of changes?" Her voice was a thread of sound. Her hands trembled, her fingers twitching as if trying to reach out, to touch the box and see what secrets it held. But she couldn't. She was too afraid.
Kaelen's eyes met hers, and for a moment, something flickered in their depths—pity, sorrow, a deep, abiding regret. "It changes the world around it," he whispered. "It changes the people who read it. It changes... everything."

A shiver ran down her spine. With a certainty that bordered on madness, she knew this man was not here for a simple repair.
"What do you want from me?" Her heart pounded a wild, frantic rhythm that echoed in her ears like the distant beat of a drum.

Elara's breath hitched. The air in the shop had thickened, the very molecules pressing in on her, heavy with unspoken dread. The weight of the lead-lined box appeared to pull at the fabric of reality itself. The scent of old paper and lemon oil had faded, replaced by something metallic, something that smelled like blood and rust.
"Contain it?" she echoed, her voice barely a whisper. "You mean... seal it?"

Kaelen's lips pressed into a thin line. "Seal it, yes. But not just any seal. A permanent one. A binding that cannot be undone."

Elara's fingers twitched, her nails digging into the soft flesh of her palms. The phantom ache of the locket's whisper hummed against her memory, the way it had pulsed with a life of its own. With a certainty that bordered on madness, she knew this was no ordinary book.
