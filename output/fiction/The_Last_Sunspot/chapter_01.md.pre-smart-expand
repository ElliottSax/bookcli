Chapter 1: The Dimming Sun

Elara’s morning began, as all her mornings did, with the sun. Or rather, with the absence of it.

She stood on the worn sandstone balcony of her spire, her bare feet pressed against stone still holding the night’s chill. The eastern sky should have been a riot of gold and rose, the sun a blistering coin cresting the jagged teeth of the Dawnspire Mountains. Instead, the light was thin, diluted. A watercolor wash of pale yellow bled into a greyish blue, as if the sky itself were an old tapestry left too long in the light. The sun, when it finally inched into view, was a muted, brassy disc, its edges strangely fuzzy, its heart dimmed.

A cold knot, entirely new, tightened in Elara’s stomach. She pushed it down, wrapping her linen robe tighter. “Just a cloud,” she whispered to the dawn, her voice a rasp of sleep. “A high, thin cloud.”

Her ritual demanded joy. It was the fuel, the flint, the spark. She closed her eyes, seeking the memory-glow: the taste of sun-warmed blackberries bursting on her tongue as a child; the feeling of her mother’s laugh, a sound like crystal bells in a warm breeze; the sheer, giddy weightlessness of her first successful solar-lift, hovering ten feet above a field of blooming saffron. She gathered these shards of light within her chest, feeling the familiar, comforting heat begin to kindle behind her sternum. It was fainter than yesterday. Slower.

She opened her eyes, raised her palms to the anemic sun, and began the Song of Ignition. The notes were pure and clear, a melody passed down through generations of Solar Witches. As she sang, the latent heat in her blood answered, swirling up through her arms. Golden light, the color of pure clover honey, pooled in her cupped hands. It should have been a miniature star, blazing, throwing sharp shadows against the spire walls. Today, it was a wavering globe of candlelight, trembling as if in a draft.

With a final, sustained note, she bent and poured the gathered sunlight into the great terracotta pot at the balcony’s edge. Here grew Helianthus Maxima, a sunflower bred by her grandmother. Its stem was thick as her wrist, its head a broad plate that followed the sun’s path with devout precision. Under a true blessing, it would shudder, its petals glowing from within, and a new ring of seeds would crystallize into edible gold at its heart.

The weak, honeyed light splashed over the flower. For a moment, nothing. Then, a faint, sickly shimmer traveled up the stalk. The great head, which had been straining toward the dim sun, gave a feeble twitch. A single, vibrant yellow petal at the edge browned at the tip, then curled in on itself with a soft, dry sigh. It drifted down to the soil, a spot of decay on the rich, dark loam.

The light in Elara’s hands guttered and died. The song choked in her throat.

She stared at the fallen petal, the cold knot in her stomach now a solid, icy weight. Her magic had never failed. Not like this. Her joy, scraped raw from t
