Chapter 2: Vale of Sighs

The world bled out its colour a mile from the Gloomweaver border. It wasn't a sudden curtain drawn, but a gradual leaching, as if the very soil was tired of vibrancy. The emerald moss under Elara’s boots greyed, then softened into a velvet charcoal. The cheerful chirps of sun-sparrows faded, replaced by a silence so profound it rang in her ears. The air, once spiced with pine and warm earth, grew cool and carried the scent of damp stone and forgotten things. This wasn't decay, but dormancy—a world holding its breath.

Elara’s own light became a burden. The soft, buttery glow that usually haloed her, a mere byproduct of her being, now felt garish and loud. It pushed against the grey, creating hard-edged islands of gold in the sea of monochrome. And the grey fought back. Shadows, which in her sun-drenched meadows were friendly companions to the light, here had substance. They pooled thicker in her path. They clung to the gnarled, silver-barked trees like lichen, flinching as she passed. Once, a shape detached itself from a trunk—a creature of woven darkness and sorrowful, pearl-like eyes. It let out a soundless shriek, dissolving into a puff of colder air as her light touched it. Elara felt a pang of guilt, sharp as a thorn. Her presence was an act of violence here.

The forest grew denser, the canopy above stitching itself into a twilight tapestry. No sun, no sky—only varying degrees of gloom. Her heart, that furnace of joy she was meant to tend, sputtered. It was hard to summon the feeling here, where every whispering leaf seemed to sigh a dirge. She walked for hours, guided by a sinking pull in her solar plexus, the Conclave’s compass leading her toward the epicentre of this sorrow.

She found him in a ruin.

It had once been an observatory, perhaps, or a noble’s folly. Now, shattered arches of bone-white stone clawed at the grey sky, and the floor was a mosaic of cracked slate and resilient, grey-flowered weeds. In the centre, his back to her, sat Kaelen.

He was not what she had pictured. The stories spoke of a hunched, malevolent figure, a spider in a web of nightmares. But Kaelen was young, or seemed it, his posture one of weary grace rather than wickedness. He wore simple, dark clothes that blended with the stones. His hair was the colour of a raven’s wing, stark against his pallor. And he was weaving.

Not on a loom, but in the air. From his long, pale fingers, strands of living shadow spun and twisted, drawn from the very atmosphere of the vale. They coiled like smoke, and as he guided them with minute gestures, they solidified. He was crafting a bird—a raven, intricate and perfect—from pure shade. As the final thread was placed, the creature ruffled its insubstantial feathers, let out a croak that was the echo of a sound, and took flight, dissolving into the greater darkness of the archway before it reached the open air. The act was beautiful, and it filled Elara with an unbearable sadness.

She stepped on a
