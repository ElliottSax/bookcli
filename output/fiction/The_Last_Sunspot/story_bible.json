      "role": "Protagonist, Solar Attendant",
      "description": "A young woman whose magic and purpose are tied to the sun. She is disciplined, hopeful, but increasingly fearful as her source of power dims. Her warmth is both literal and emotional.",

      "role": "Love Interest, Shadow-Weaver",

  "plot_summary": "In a world where the sun is dying, Elara, a Solar Attendant, performs daily rituals to stoke the fading light with memories of joy. As the dimming accelerates, she encounters Kaelen, a shadow-weaver from a rival conclave, who is resigned to the coming dark. Their initial conflict sparks an unexpected connection, revealing that their opposed magics don't cancel each other but interact in a new, potent way. As the cosmic anomaly known as the Eternal Eclipse approaches to consume the last sun, the rigid conclaves prepare for a final, futile conflict. Elara and Kaelen, realizing their combined power of embodied light and shadow represents a third option, defy both sides. In a climactic union of magic and emotion, they don't fight the Eclipse but merge with it, transforming it. The result is not a restored sun, but a new eternal twilight\u2014a permanent, gentle balance of their essences. The world is saved, not by returning to the old ways, but by creating a new one born from their love, leaving the old orders bewildered and a new era begun.",
