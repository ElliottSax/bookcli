# Chapter 3

Chapter 4

The silence after the transmission was different. It had weight, texture. It pressed against the observation glass like a held breath. Elara kept the headset on, the signal a steady, metronomic companion in her skull. Beep-beep-beep. Beeeeep-beeeeep-beeeeep. It was no longer an anomaly; it was a conversation she was having alone, a secret she wore coiled inside her ear.

For three days, she moved through the station’s routines like a ghost haunting her own life. She ran diagnostics on the long-range arrays, her fingers moving over the controls by rote while her mind traced the red line on the viewer. She ate reconstituted vegetable stew in the galley, tasting nothing, hearing the beeps beneath the hum of the recycler. She slept in fitful bursts in her bunk, the signal threading through her dreams, transforming into the steady, desperate ping of a heart monitor in a white room.

She avoided the main console. The act of sending the burst had created a before and an after, and the console was the altar of that divide. Instead, she found herself drawn to the station’s underbelly, to the service corridor with the leaking pipe. The slow, persistent drip… drip… drip into the pan was a problem with edges. It was knowable. She could shut a valve, apply a sealant, make it stop. She spent hours down there, not fixing it, just listening to its simple, earthly complaint.

On the morning of the fourth day, CHIRP’s voice broke the station’s ambient hum. “Elara. Priority channel activation. Incoming encrypted data stream from Agency Command. Marked Eyes Only. Receipt confirmation for your burst is included.”

The storm. Ahead of schedule.

Her stomach tightened. “Put it on the main screen, audio only. No visual.”

“Acknowledged.”

A hiss of static, then a voice, male, clipped, devoid of locality. It was the voice of manuals and tribunals. “Station Custodian Vance. This is Director Kaelen, Special Projects Division. Your data burst has been received and authenticated. The discovery is unprecedented. You are to consider yourself and Sycamore Station under immediate Protocol Quarantine-Omega. No further transmissions of any kind are authorized, inbound or outbound. A dedicated assessment team is en route via fast-courier. ETA seventy-two hours. Your priority is preservation of the signal and station integrity. Await briefing upon team arrival. Acknowledge.”

The message ended. No questions. No congratulations. Just orders, and a quarantine that felt less like containment and more like a lid being sealed.

“Acknowledge via text-only receipt,” Elara said, her own voice strange to her.

“Sent.”

Seventy-two hours. Then her station, her silence, her signal, would belong to the Agency. To Director Kaelen and his Special Projects. She knew what that meant: rooms within rooms, classifications that buried truth, people becoming assets. Her mother’s face, pale against a hospital pillow, flashed in her mind. Her personal communiqué, now scrubbed, felt like a betrayal of a different kind.

“CHIRP, run a full, passive scan of all local space. Extreme range. Look for any movement, any drive signatures approaching from the inner system.”

“Running. Passive scan only will limit detection range by forty percent.”

“I know. Do it.”

She couldn’t stop them from coming. But she didn’t have to greet them with empty hands. The signal was more than the Agency’s data packet. It was in the space between the beeps. It was in the wear on the transmission’s carrier wave, a faint, almost imperceptible degradation that suggested immense age. The Agency would tear it apart for what it said. Elara found herself obsessed with what it was.

That afternoon, she began an experiment. She had CHIRP create a visual model of the signal, not as a sound wave, but as a topographical map. Each beep was a peak, each pause a valley. She projected it onto the large wall screen in the lab. A jagged, repeating mountain range stretched into a digital distance. She stared at it for hours, walking its length, noting the subtle asymmetries in what should have been a perfect pattern. The long beeps were not identical. The third one in each sequence was a fraction of a millisecond shorter, its peak slightly eroded.

“It’s old,” she said aloud. “And it’s tired.”

“The signal shows entropy consistent with prolonged transmission through interstellar medium,” CHIRP confirmed. “Estimated duration of continuous broadcast exceeds preliminary models. Current projection: eight hundred thousand Earth years, plus or minus fifty thousand.”

The number hung in the air. Eight hundred millennia. Humanity was building mud huts when this thing started calling out. What kind of patience was that? What kind of despair?

“It’s not a beacon,” she murmured, a conviction hardening in her chest. “A beacon is hopeful. It expects an answer. This… this is a record. A message set to repeat because the senders knew no one would be left to turn it off.”

She thought of the lake stone in her pocket. A record of water and time. This signal was a stone, too, hurled into the cosmic dark.

On the second day, she found the ghost.

She was running a deep-layer analysis on the signal’s background radiation, a faint hiss underlying the beeps. It was the audio equivalent of cosmic dust. But within that hiss, almost buried, was another pattern. Not a sound, but a rhythmic absence of sound. A series of tiny, precise silences.

“CHIRP, isolate the null zones in the background carrier. Filter everything else out.”

The audio in her headset hollowed out. The beeps vanished. What remained was a faint, rhythmic pulse of nothing: shhh-shhh-shhh. Shhh———shhh———shhh. Shhh-shhh-shhh.

A chill, sharp and electric, traced her spine. It was a shadow signal. A pattern woven into the negative space. A whisper hiding beneath a shout.

“It’s a counter-signature,” she breathed. “Like a watermark. Or a signature.”

“The pattern is artificial. Its rhythm is mathematical, not stochastic. Probability of natural occurrence is near zero.”

Someone had signed their work. Not with a flourish, but with a secret. The main signal was for anyone who might be listening. This quiet pulse of silence was for someone who knew how to listen better.

Elara felt a surge of something she hadn’t felt in years: pure, undiluted discovery. This was hers. The Agency’s scanners would be looking for content, for a language to decipher. They wouldn’t be listening to the shape of the silence within the noise. She had to preserve it. Not for them, but for the silent ones who sent it.

She worked through the station’s artificial night, compiling her notes, her observations on the signal’s age and its hidden signature. She didn’t document them in the official log. Instead, she used an old, standalone datapad she kept for personal manifests, something not networked to CHIRP or the station core. She wrote in clear, plain language. Not a report, but a testament.

The signal is not a call. It is an epitaph. And it is signed.

She hid the datapad behind a loose panel in her bunk compartment, next to the smooth lake stone.

On the morning the Agency was due, the station’s ambient noise changed. A new vibration, deep and subsonic, crept into the metal bones of Sycamore. It was the feeling of a large object moving nearby on careful thrusters.

“CHIRP. Status.”

“One vessel on passive scan. Configuration matches Agency fast-courier class. It is holding at fifty kilometers, just beyond the official station boundary. No hail. No docking request.”

They were watching. Assessing. Not a friendly visit, then. An insertion.

“They’re scanning us right back,” Elara said, pulling on her standard-issue station jumpsuit, her fingers fumbling with the clasps. “Full internal diagnostics. Are they attempting any system access?”

“Negative. All firewalls are intact. They are conducting high-resolution exterior and energy-profile scans. The scan intensity suggests they are looking for… anomalies beyond the reported signal.”

“Or making sure I’m alone.” She took a steadying breath. “Alright. When they hail, put them through everywhere. Let them know we see them.”

But the hail didn’t come. An hour later, the proximity alert chimed softly. “Unauthorized launch detected from the courier. One small personnel shuttle on approach vector. Docking request now incoming.”

It was a power play. Skipping the courtesy, coming straight to the airlock.

“Grant it. Depressurize Dock Two and match rotation.”

She stood in the corridor outside the docking ring, the station’s heartbeat of pumps and fans the only sound. The magnetic seals clunked, heavy and final. Hisses equalized pressure. With a soft groan, the inner door slid open.

Three figures stood in the haze of venting coolant. They wore sleek, black environment suits without agency markings, helmets already off and tucked under their arms. The one in front was a woman with severe, grey-streaked black hair cut close to her scalp and eyes the color of flint. She carried an air of absolute, unruffled authority. The man to her left was younger, broad-shouldered, his gaze constantly moving, cataloging the corridor, the panels, Elara herself. The woman to her right was slight, with sharp, intelligent features and glasses with data-lenses currently powered down.

The lead woman’s eyes found Elara. “Custodian Vance. I am Commander Rhea Talos. This is Specialist Varn,” a slight nod to the man, “and Dr. Aris,” a nod to the woman with glasses. “We are the advance team. Director Kaelen sends his regards.”

Her voice was smoother than the transmission’s, but just as devoid of warmth. It was a voice used to being obeyed.

“Commander,” Elara said, finding her station custodian tone, flat and professional. “You made good time. The station is at your disposal.”

Talos’s smile was a thin, perfunctory line. “We’ll need full system access. All logs, from the moment of detection to now. And the raw signal feed, isolated and pure. No filters.”

“Of course. My AI, CHIRP, can provide everything. The main console is this way.”

As she led them through the sterile corridors, she felt their eyes on her back. Specialist Varn’s were assessing threats. Dr. Aris’s were devouring details. Talos’s were measuring control.

In the control room, Talos went straight to the main viewer. “Show me.”

Elara nodded to CHIRP. The starfield appeared, the thin, relentless red line lancing out from Sycamore. The audio of the signal filled the room. Beep-beep-beep. Beeeeep-beeeeep-beeeeep.

Talos listened, her face impassive. Dr. Aris leaned forward, her fingers twitching as if she wanted to touch the sound. Varn positioned himself by the door, a silent sentinel.

“Your analysis suggested a potential distress pattern,” Talos said, not looking away from the screen.

“It’s a repeating ternary code of immense age. The structure is simple, but the duration suggests—”

“We have our own analysts, Custodian.” Talos cut her off. “Dr. Aris is our signal specialist. You will give her all your data, then your role becomes station maintenance and support. Ensure our team has whatever we require. Quarters, power, privacy.”

The dismissal was clean, surgical. Elara was being cut out of her own discovery. She felt a hot spike of defiance, but kept her voice level. “Understood. CHIRP will allocate quarters and provide full access to the designated data cores. The station’s integrity is my priority.”

“Good.” Talos finally turned to look at her. “One more thing. Protocol Quarantine-Omega is now in full effect. Your personal communication privileges are suspended. All outbound data streams are locked. This station is now a sealed environment. For everyone’s safety.”

Elara’s blood went cold. She thought of the unspoken question about her mother, the un-sent message now eternally in the queue. “For how long?”

“Until we determine the nature of what we’re dealing with. And until we decide if a response is… advisable.” Talos’s flinty eyes held hers. “You’ve done your duty, Custodian. Now let us do ours. You are dismissed.”

The finality in the word was absolute. Elara gave a short nod, turned, and walked out of the control room. She felt Varn’s eyes on her until she turned the corner.

She didn’t go far. She slipped into a secondary monitoring alcove, a cramped space with a single terminal linked to environmental systems. From here, she could listen. CHIRP, following her standing orders, fed the control room’s audio to her discreetly through an earpiece.

She heard Dr. Aris’s voice, eager and precise. “The carrier wave degradation is remarkable. The entropy markers are off the scale. This is ancient, Commander. Pre-human, by orders of magnitude.”

“Focus on the content, Doctor,” Talos replied. “Is it a map? A warning? A weapon schematic? The Director wants categories, not poetry.”

“It’s too simple for complex schematics. The repeating pattern suggests a foundational message. A primer, perhaps. Or… a lure.”

“A lure?”

“Something easy to find. Something to draw in a listener. The real message might be in the response it provokes.”

There was a long pause. Elara held her breath.

“Specialist Varn,” Talos said, her voice lower. “Complete a full sweep. I want every centimeter of this station scanned for any other anomalies. Check for secondary signals, energy spikes, anything Custodian Vance might have missed. Or omitted.”

“Yes, Commander.”

“And Doctor,” Talos continued. “Begin composing a response.”

Elara’s hand flew to her mouth, stifling a gasp. Protocol Gamma-Seven was clear: Under no circumstances initiate a response broadcast.

“Commander, the protocols—” Aris sounded uncertain.

“Are for unknown contacts. This is not unknown anymore. It’s a relic. A tool. We will ping it. A simple echo of its own pattern, sent back along the same vector. We need to see if it’s still monitored. If anything… listens.”

“The risk of provoking an unknown entity—”

“Is outweighed by the strategic necessity of understanding it. The Director agrees. Prepare the echo pulse. We transmit in twelve hours.”

The audio cut off as CHIRP detected movement near the alcove. Elara pulled the earpiece out, her heart hammering against her ribs. They weren’t here to study. They were here to experiment. To poke the ancient, sleeping thing with a stick.

She thought of the ghost signal, the silent signature woven within. What if the main signal was the lure, and the silent pulse was the trigger? What if an echo was exactly what it was waiting for?

The weight in the silence around her was no longer charged with possibility. It was charged with peril. The Agency hadn’t come to share her shore. They had come to launch a boat into the dark, and they were going to use her silence, her signal, as the tide.

She was no longer just the one who had been heard.

She was the one who had brought the listeners. And as she sat in the dim alcove, the station’s vibrations now carrying the footsteps of intruders, Elara Vance knew with cold certainty that she had to find a way to unheard it all. Before the echo left the dock. Before the silence at Sycamore Station shattered into something from which there was no return.
