# Chapter 1: The Last Human in the Dark

The silence of Sycamore Station wasn't an absence of sound, but a presence. It was a physical thing, a cold, dense fluid that filled the corridors and pressed against the viewports, seeping into the marrow. Elara Vance felt it most in her teeth—a faint, constant vibration that was the station’s hum, the only proof her own heart was still beating against the void. Outside the thick quartz of the main observation blister, the universe sprawled in an indifferent tapestry of ink and diamond dust. There was no Earth-sun here, no friendly blue marble. Only the distant, cold gleam of 36 Ophiuchi, a sullen orange eye watching from six light-years away.

Sycamore was a listening post, a neurological node in the spine of human expansion. Its job was to catch the whispers of a hundred colony worlds and ferry them, amplified and cleansed of cosmic static, back to the hungry ears of Earth. It was a vital, tedious, and profoundly lonely occupation. The station was automated, built for a skeleton crew of three. Budget cuts and the “Efficiency Paradigm” had whittled that down to one. Elara was the last synapse in the nerve, the final human filter before the silence of space met the chatter of home.

Her day, like all her days for the past eleven months and sixteen days, began with the dishes.

Getting to the primary array meant suiting up. The ritual was a meditation in confinement. The inner lock hissed shut behind her, and the room’s atmosphere was sucked away with a sound like a dying breath. Then the outer door slid open onto the service gantry, and the true silence arrived. Not the station’s hum, but the absolute, airless quiet of the interstellar deep. Her own breathing, loud and wet in her helmet, was the only rhythm in creation.

Before her, the great dish of Antenna Alpha yawned, a parabolic bowl of spun composite a hundred meters across. It was a fossilized ear turned forever towards the human frontier. Stars glimmered through its mesh like trapped fireflies. Elara’s task was to inspect the feeder horn at the dish’s focal point, a delicate cluster of receivers sensitive enough to hear a colony ship’s engine fart from half a system away. She floated along the gantry, her mag-boots clunking with each step, a solitary beetle on the ribs of a dead god.

As she worked, running diagnostics with gloved fingers that felt stupid and thick, her mind played its usual traitorous games. It conjured the sound of a voice, a real one, not from a comms log. It imagined a hand on her shoulder, the warmth of another body in the station’s perpetual 18-degree Celsius chill. She shook her head, the motion amplified in the helmet. *Sentiment is a system error*, she recited silently, a mantra from her training. *Attach to the process, not the environment.*

But the environment was all there was. It was the curved walls, the endless data scrolls, the same six meals in rotation, and the silence.

Back inside, after the deconta
