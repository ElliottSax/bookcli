  "title": "The Silence at Sycamore Station",
  "genre": "horror",
  "subgenre": "cosmic",
  "premise": "A lone signal technician, the last human stationed at a remote deep-space relay, begins receiving a perfect, repeating signal from the void. The signal isn't a message from another civilization\u2014it's a flawless, silent copy of Earth's own total radio emissions, broadcast from a point in space where nothing should exist, and it's getting louder every day, drowning out all other transmissions and severing her last link home.",
  "protagonist": "Elara Vance, a brilliant but socially anxious communications engineer who volunteered for the solitary post to escape a traumatic past on Earth.",
  "conflict": "Elara must confront the psychological unraveling of total isolation while trying to understand the nature and intent of the mimetic signal before it completely consumes her station's systems and her sanity, all while grappling with the terrifying possibility that the signal isn't an invasion, but an indifferent cosmic echo that will simply replace humanity's voice with its own perfect, empty copy.",
  "setting": "The near future, aboard the Sycamore Deep-Space Communications Relay, a small, aging facility floating in the absolute quiet between solar systems.",
  "tone": "A creeping, claustrophobic dread of vast, impersonal cosmic forces, blending the paranoia of isolation with the existential terror of being rendered irrelevant by something incomprehensibly large and silent."
