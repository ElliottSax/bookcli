Chapter 7

The green light made ghosts of everything. It pooled in the hollows of Varn’s face as he turned, weapon raised, turning the grim set of his mouth into something ghoulish. The faint, sickly glow of the emergency strips in the corridor beyond appeared to mock him, a cruel reminder of the darkness that lurked just beyond the reach of his light. The air, robbed of its mechanical breath, grew thick and cold, like a physical presence that pressed against his skin. Elara could feel the chill leaching through the soles of her boots from the deck plating below, a cold thato seep into her very bones.
The only sound was that dragging scrape from above, a metronome of wrongness, and the new, quicker pulse of the main signal – no longer a distant chime, but a pressure behind her eyes, a second, alien heartbeat thudding in her skull. It was a sound that seemed to erate through every molecule of air, a reminder that something was coming, something that didn’t want to be ignored.
“Move,” Varn hissed, his voice a stripped wire. He didn’t look at her. His eyes were fixed on the open service hatch in the ceiling, a square of deeper black against the green-tinged shadows of the overhead gantry. The faint hum of the Sycamore Station’s life support systems seemeate through the air, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there was still a fragile, mechanical heartbeat that kept them alive.
The scrape came again. Closer. It wasn’t a clean sound. It was layered – a primary grind of something unyielding on metal, undercut by a faint, wet susurration, like meat on stone. The sound sent a shiver down Elara’s spine, a primal fear that seemed to awakappeared toing deep within her. She knew that sound, knew the feeling of being stalked by something that didn’t want to be seen.
Elara’s paralysis broke. This was her Sycamore Station. Her corpse. She knew its bones. She knew the way to the main engineering console, the way to the backup cells that might just give them a chance to survive. She lunged for the console, her fingers flying over the dead touchscreen. “Backup cells,” she muttered, the words tasting of copper and fear. The screen flickered, stuttered, and glowed with a weak, amber light. System schematics appeared, flashing red in three sectors: Lower Archives, Primary Life Support Junction B, and the Conduit Chase that ran vertically beside this very bay.
The intrusion was moving down. toward them.
“CHIRP,” she commanded, her voice steadier than she felt. The AI’s response was a shattered mosaic of sound. “Affirm… ative. Door… mechanisms… compromised. Unknown… particulate… fouling… tracks.” The words seemed to ha air, a cold, clinical assessment of the situation.
“What particulate?” Varn asked, his voice low and urgent. Elara hesitated, unsure of what to say. The particulate was a mystery, which defy explanappeared to was organic and mineral, which be both adead at the same time.
“Analysis… incomplete. Organic… and… mineral… composite. Attempting… seal.” The AI’s response was a slow, mechanical process, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there was still a fragile, mechanical heartbeat that kept them alive.
A heavy, hydraulic thump echoed from somewhere deep in the Sycamore Station’s spine, followed by a tortured shriek of metal forcing itself against a resistant mass. The sound died in a choked, final grind. The schematic showed the blast door in Chase Three stuck at forty percent closure.
“It’s trapped something in the door,” Varn interpreted, his weapon now tracking an imaginary path down the wall. “Or the door trapped part of it.
Talos’s voice erupted from the comms panel, tinny and distorted through the emergency power. “—arn! Elara! Report! We are seeing catastrophic feedback in the main signal! The harmonic distortion is replicating! It’s building a… a structure!” The words seemed to reverberate througappeared toolecule of air, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there was still a fragile, mechanical heartbeat that kept them alive.
“We have a more immediate problem,” Varn barked into his wrist unit. “There’s a physical entity on the Sycamore Station. CHIRP’s calling it non-human. It’s in the walls.
A beat of stunned silence. Then, Talos, his scientific fervor undimmed. “A manifestation? A coherent energy-matter transduction? You must get visual! Data is critical!” The words seemed to hang in the air,er that even in the midst of chaos, there was still a fragile, mechanical heartbeat that kept them alive.
“My critical data is its trajectory,” Varn shot back. “It’s heading for the archive. Why?” The question seemed to hang in the air, a cold, appeared toassessment of the situation.
Elara knew. The archive was cold storage, yes. But it was also the Sycamore Station’s neurological center. Conduits for data, for sensor feeds, for CHIRP’s auxiliary processing nodes all converged there. It was the one place, other than the engineering bay itself, where you could listen to the Sycamore Station’s whispers most clearly. Where you could maybe listen out.
“It’s not simply here,” she said, the realization dawning with cold clarity. “It’s listening. The splinter. It’s an ear. The main signal… it’s unspooling, building something new from Talos’s distorted echo. This thing is here to gather more raw material.
The scraping stopped.
The silence was worse. It was a held breath. The only sound was the frantic, almost eager pulse of the tombstone signal, now syncopated with the rush of blood in Elara’s ears. It was a sound that seemed to reverberate through evele of air, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there was still a fragile, mechanical heartbeat that kept them alive.
Varn motioned sharply toward the bay’s main exit, a heavy pressure door leading to the central corridor. “We go. Now. To the archive.
“It’s between us and there,” Elara argued, but she was already moving, grabbing a heavy torque wrench from a nearby rack. It was pitiful, but its weight was a comfort. The wrench solid in her hand, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there was still a fragile, mechanical heartbeat that kept them alive.
“It’s in the walls,” Varn corrected, his voice low. “The corridor might be clear. We need to see what it wants. We need to know what we invited in.
They moved to the door. Varn hit the manual release. With a groan, it slid open a foot before jamming. The green emergency strips in the corridor beyond were dark. A deeper blackness waited there, smelling of ozone and something else – a dry, chalky scent, like a long-sealed tomb.
Varn squeezed through, his shoulder scraping the frame. Elara followed, the cold of the metal door kissing her back as she slipped into the corridor. The darkness was absolute, a physical presence. She could hear Varn’s measured breathing beside her, the faint creak of his gear. From far away, through layers of deck and insulation, she could hear Talos’s team arguing, their voices muffled and panicked.
Then, a new sound. Not from above. From ahead, around the curve of the corridor that led to the archive junction.
It was a wet, rhythmic tap.
Tap. Scrape. Tap.
Like something with too many joints was testing the floor.
Varn raised his sidearm, a solid-barrelled mag-pistol that seemed primitive. He clicked on a barrel-mounted light. The beam was a violent intrusion, carving a tunnel of stark white through the black. It swept over grimy walls, conduit labels, a fallen toolkit.
It settled on the junction ahead.
The archive blast door was there, a massive slab of reinforced titanium. And caught in its partially closed maw was a shape.
Elara’s mind refused to parse it at first. It was a mass of contradictions. It seemed to bloat and shrink, like a living appeared tot was organic and mineral, which defy explanation. It was a thieemed to be both alive and dead at the same timeappeared toy watched, the shape move, its edges blurring and shifting like a liquid. It was aitemg that was made of many things, a thing that be both solid and fluid at the same time.
Elaappeared to shiver run down her spine. She knew that matter, knew the feeling of being stalked by something that didn’t want to be seen. She knew the sound of its footsteps, the sound of its breathing.
And she knew that it was coming for them.
The shapto move, its edges blurring and shifting like a liquid. Elara feelings of dread wash over her,hints off being trapped in a nightmare from which she couldn’t wake.
It settled on the shape, illuminating its twisted, organic form. Elara shiver run down her spine.
The shape was watching them, its edges blurring and shie a liquid.
And then, in an instant, it was gone.
Elara nodded, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew that they had to get out of there, knew that they had to escape before it was too late.
The corridor stretched ahead, a tunnel of fractured light and shadow. The emergency strips flickered like dying stars, casting jagged patterns across the bulkheads. Elara’s breath came in short, sharp bursts, her fingers tightening around the grip of her pulse rifle. The air smelled of ozone and something else—something metallic, like blood.
Varn moved ahead of her, his silhouette sharp against the dim glow. He didn’t turn back, didn’t slow. His focus was locked on the far end of the corridor, where the darkness seemed to pulse, alive with something unseen.
“You feel that?”appeared tored, his voice low.
Elara nodded, though he couldn't see it. The pressure in her skull had intensified, a throbbing ache that made her teeth hurt. "It's getting worse."

Varn's jaw clenched. "We need to move. Now."

They reached the end of the corridor, where a heavy blast door stood half-open, its edges warped from some unseen force. Beyond it, the Sycamore Station's layout became unfamiliar - narrow passages, bulkheads stripped of their plating, exposed wiring snaking through the darkness.
Elara hesitated. "This isn't the way we arrived in."

"No," Varn said. "But it's the only way out."

The scrape came again, closer this time. It wasn't just a sound - it was a vibration in the deck, a shudder that ran up through her boots. The thing was getting smarter.
Varn kicked the blast door the rest of the way open, the metal groaning in protest. The corridor beyond was a mess of wreckage - shattered consoles, twisted support beams, the remains of a security drone. The air was thick with dust, swirling in the dim light.
Elara coughed, her throat raw. "What happened here?"

Varn didn't answer. He was already moving, his rifle raised, scanning the shadows. "Stay close."

She followed, her steps careful, her senses on high alert. Every shadow seemed to move, every flicker of light a potential threat. The in her head was unbearable now, a relentless pulse that made her vision blur.
Then she saw it.
A shape, half-hidden in the wreckage. Not aelementg, but a presence - a dark, shifting mass that seemed to absorb the light around it. It wasn't solid. It wasn't liquiappeared to something different.
Varn saw it too. His rifapproachedame up, his finger tightening on the trigger.
"Don't," Elara whispered. "It's not -"

The thing moved.
It was a swarm - a thousand shifting fragments that came together and fell apart in the same breath. It didn't attack. I merely st existed, and its existence was enough to distort the world around it.
Elara's breath caught. The air seemed to ripple, the walls warping like reflections in disturbed wapressure in her skull exploded into agony, and she stumbled, her knees hitting the deck.
Varn grabbed her arm, hauling her up. "Elara!"

She couldn't answer. The pain was too much. The world was too much. She could feel taspecting's presence, not just in her mind, but in her bones, in her blood.
Then, as as it had come, the pressure eased.
The thing was gone.
Varn's grip on her arm loosened, but he didn't let go. His eyes were wide, his breath ragged. "What was that?"

Elara swallowed, her throat dry. "I don't know."

But she did.
She knew, and the knowledge terrified her.
The corridor was silent now, the only sound the faint hum of the Sycamore Station's failing systems. The air was still, the dust settling over the wreckage.
Varn exhaled sharply. "We need to keep moving."

Elara nodded, though her legs like lead. She forced herself to stand, to follow him as he moved deeper into the darkness.
The Sycamore Station was dying.
And so, she feared, were they.
As they moved through the corridor, the silence grew thicker. Elara could feel the Sycamore Station's secrets pressing down on her. She knew they were being watched, knew they were being stalked by something that didn't want to be seen.
And then, in an instant, they were at the archive junction. The blast door loomed before them, a massive slab of reinforced titanium. Elara shiver run down her spine.
The door slid open, revealing a dark space beyond. Elara adread wash over her, a sense of feelings ofped.
They moved forward, their footsteps echoing through the darkness. The silence grew thicker, pressing against their skin. Elara could feel the weight of the unknown bearing down on her.
And then, in an instant, they faced the unknown.
The darkness coalesced into a shape, which be made of many things. It was both solid and fluid at the same timappeared to was alive.
And then, in an instant, it spoke.
The sound was likeElara had ever heard before. It was a sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time, which appeared toamiliar and yet completely alien.
It was a sound that seemed t am here. I am watching. And I will not be ignored.”

Elara sense oappeared toh over her, a sense of bed in a nightmare from which she couldn’t wake. She knew that they were in grave danger, knew that they had to get out of there before it was too late.
But it was too late.

And then, in an instant, it was upon them.
