**Chapter 4: The Hydroponics Annex**

The Sycamore Station's ventilation hummed at a deeper pitch, a low thrumming that resonated through the ship's bones. This was the sound of a system adjusting to new pressure and heat, a new presence that was putting a strain on its resources. Elara sat in a shadowed alcove until the chill from the metal bulkhead became a familiar sensation, seeping through her jumpsuit and into her skin. The cold settled into her bones, making her aware of every ache and pain that had been dormant. Her fingers stiff and unresponsive on her knees.
The thought of what was about to happen was no longer a sharp fear, but a heavy, cold feeling in her gut. It was a bad idea, she thought, a perversion of the principles of discovery. It was like finding an ancient tomb and smashing the entrance instead of carefully exploring it. The message inside wasn't the goal; the goal was to provoke a reaction. Talos didn't want to listen; he wanted to get a response. And Varn was the one who would make it happen.
As she waited, the familiar sounds of the Sycamore Station changed. The constant hum of the gravity generators became the background noise for a series of intrusions. The sound of heavy footsteps echoed through the corridors above, and the murmur of Agency personnel on the comms channel created feelings of tension. Each phrase - "grid seven secure," "scanning tertiary life support" - added to the picture of a station being taken over. The air recycling system, normally a gentle hiss, now carried the scent of new technology and disinfectant. Elara's senses, heightened by her solitude, made her feel raw and on edge. The station itself was a living thing, its steady pulse disrupted by jolts of anxiety.
She knew she had to move. Sitting still would make her an easy target. The CHIRP signal on her wrist-terminal showed Varn's search pattern, a tightening spiral focused on the lower cargo bays. This was her window, but it was closing fast. She slipped out of the alcove, her movements smooth from practice, but her mind was racing with half-formed plans.
Her quarters were no longer safe; they were a known location, likely already scanned for hidden data or secret compartments. She needed a place that was off the grid, a spot the station's own systems had forgotten. The observation deck was too obvious, too sentimental; it was the first place anyone would look for her. Her mind scanned through years of maintenance reports and logs, settling on the old hydroponics annex on Deck Seven. It had been closed three years ago after a fungal infection had destroyed the crops. The decontamination process had been extreme, and the sector was still sealed. The logs showed that the environmental seals were intact, but life support was minimal, and the lights were set to a dim, permanent twilight. To the Agency's scanners, it would appear as a dead zone: no heat, minimal power, and no signs of life.
Getting to the annex was a nerve-wracking journey. Every distant noise made her jump, every conversation on the comms channel tightened her muscles. She avoided the main lifts, with their cheerful chimes that now sounded like alarms, and instead used the narrow service ladders that ran through the station's superstructure. The rungs were cold and slick, leaving greasy marks on her palms. The air in the shafts was stale and thick, tasting of recycled oxygen, old lubricant, and the faint tang of cosmic radiation.
As she descended, the managed sounds of the occupied station faded, replaced by something older and deeper. Here, it was the creak and groan of the Sycamore’s hull settling in the void, the steady drip of condensation, the stuck skittering of a cleaning ‘bot on a lower deck. The darkness was not complete, but it was heavy, broken only by the weak, orange glow of emergency lights at each hatch. It pushed against her, a soft, smothering feeling that made her hunch her shoulders and hug herself tighter. Every step down was a careful risk, measured in sound and vibration. The chrono on her wristo pulse with her heartbeat, each second another grain falling in an unseen hourglass.
She stepped onto Deck Seven not into a hallway, but into a tomb. The main lights were dimmed to a bare twenty percent, casting long, twisted shadows that turned the familiar curves of her home into the ribcage of a giant, metal creature. The door to the hydroponics annex didn’t slide open with its normal sigh; it hissed in protest, its seals breaking with a sound like tearing fabric. And the smell reached her—a layered scent that told the whole story of the place. Not just rot, but a deep sterility, the chemical ghost of strong cleaners and radiation treatments. Beneath it, like a faint memory, was the sweet, heavy trace of dead plants, of soil that had become a grave.
The room beyond was a monument to neglect. Vast, arched, and utterly quiet. Rows of empty growth racks stretched into the dark like the benches of a deserted church. Overhead, the broad-spectrum growth lamps were dead, their glass covered in a fine layer of dust. Below, the long nutrient trays were completely dry, their plastic surfaces cracked into intricate, thirsty maps of lost places. The only light came from the faint blue emergency strips along the walkway and the dull, red glow of a single broken status panel, its screen a web of dead pixels flashing a meaningless error.
In the room’s center, dominating everything, sat the huge, silent water reclamation unit—a blocky shape of pipes, filters, and tanks. It was the still iron heart of this dead space. A faint, leftover heat from its insulated core made a slight shimmer in the cold air, one last trace of purpose. Elara walked toward it, her boots echoing with a hollow, lonely sound on the grate. The scale of the silent machinery made her feel tiny. This was a place built for life, now holding only a manufactured quiet.
She found a nook where a bundle of thick coolant pipes met the main unit, forming a sheltered spot. The air here was a little warmer, carrying a metallic, mineral smell from inside the machinery. “CHIRP, set up a local, hidden network node here. Use the water unit’s heat and minerals to hide it. Scramble any passive bio-scans from the main grid. Make it look like a broken regulator.”

“Acknowledged,” CHIRP’s voice replied, its calm tone a strange comfort in the stillness. “Node is active. Using the reclamation unit’s thermal and conductive profile for masking. Chance of detection by a standard Agency sweep is now twelve percent and dropping. Note: staying here will leave more biological traces.”

It was something. A fragile foothold, a small bubble of scrambled data in the disorder. Elara slid down to sit on the grating, her back against the warm metal. A faint vibration from the station’s core systems traveled through the structure, a steady, far-off heartbeat. She pulled up the raw data on her terminal, the silent, secondary pulse she’d found in the stellar static. It glowed on the screen, a simple waveform, a line of energy.
Trying to hold its shape in her mind was like trying to memorize the empty space around a statue in a dark room. You could feel the presence, the *gap* where something should be, but its true form stayed just out of reach. *They need to see the shape of the silence,* she thought. But Aris was captivated by the brilliant, ancient carrier wave, the glittering box. Talos only wanted to force the box open, ignoring the delicate, older wrapping. Varn was a soldier; he looked for traps and triggers, not for the quiet wear of immense age on what seemed like an ordinary stone.
There was one thread, a filament of possibility. The signal’s entropy markers—the very thing that had made Aris’s eyes shine with scientific fervor. The carrier wave was old, impossibly old. But what if the ghost pulse, the silent contour, was *older*? Not simply a little older, but *impossibly, definitively* more ancient? It would change everything. The narrative would fracture. It would no longer be “ancient message.” It would become “ancient message built *around* something even more ancient.” A lure, perhaps, carefully constructed around a… what? A trap? A foundation? A fossil?
To prove it, she needed a deeper analysis, a temporal stratification scan that would burn through processing power like a star. The kind of operation that would light up the Sycamore Station’s secondary astrophysics core like a supernova on a monitoring board. She couldn’t run it from this dampened node. She needed the main astrophysics lab on Deck Five, with its direct access to the Sycamore Station’s most powerful sensors and quantum processors. And she needed time. Or, rather, she needed a diversion. Something to pull Talos’s and Varn’s focus, to give their hunt a new, urgent scent.
The door to the hydroponics annex hissed open, and the scent of damp earth and chlorophyll hit Elara like a physical force. She stepped inside, letting the door seal behind her, and the sudden silence was almost deafening. The air here was thick with the scent of growing things, the faint metallic tang of nutrient solutions, and the underlying sweetness of ripening fruit. The hydroponics bay was a lush, green oasis in the otherwise sterile expanse of the *Acheron*, a deliberate contrast to the cold, artificial environment of the rest of the ship.
Elara moved carefully between the rows of plants, her boots sinking slightly into the soft, damp soil. The lights above were dimmed, casting long shadows that danced with the movement of the air currents. She could hear the quiet gurgle of water pumps, the faint hum of grow lights, and the occasional rustle of leaves as they brushed against each other. It was a soothing sound, a reminder of life in a place where life was tenuous and fragile.
She stopped in front of a row of tomato plants, their vines heavy with red fruit. She reached out and plucked one, rolling it between her fingers. The skin was smooth and firm, the color deep and rich. She brought it to her nose and inhaled deeply, the scent of ripe tomatoes filling her senses. It was a small comfort, a moment of normalcy in a world that had become anything but.
A voice behind her made her jump. "You're not supposed to be here."

Elara turned to see Varn standing in the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest. His expression was unreadable, but there was a tension in his posture that suggested he was on edge.
"I needed to think," Elara said, her voice steady despite the sudden rush of adrenaline. "And this is the only place on the ship where I can do that without feeling like I'm being watched."

Varn's eyes flicked to the tomato in her hand, then back to her face. "You're not supposed to be here," he repeated, his voice low. "The hydroponics bay is off-limits to unauthorized personnel."

Elara arched an eyebrow. "Since when? I've been coming here for years. It's the only place on the ship where I can get any real privacy."

Varn's jaw tightened. "Things have changed. The Sycamore Station is on lockdown. No one is allowed to move freely without authorization."

Elara's fingers tightened around the tomato, the skin yielding slightly under her grip. "I didn't realize I needed authorization to think," she said, her voice sharp. "Or to eat a tomato."

Varn's eyes narrowed. "You're playing a dangerous game, Elara. You know that, right?"

Elara met his gaze steadily. "I'm not playing any game. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. And I don't trust Talos. I don't trust any of you."

Varn's expression darkened. "You don't know what you're talking about. You don't understand the situation."

Elara took a step closer, her voice low and intense. "Then explain it to me. Tell me what's really going on. Because from where I stand, it looks like you're all hiding something. And I'm not going t merely st sit back and let you use me as a pawn in whatever game you're playing."

Varn's eyes flickered with something—anger, frustration, or maybe something else. But before he could respond, the lights in the hydroponics bay flickered and dimmed. The air seemed to eavier, the hum of the machinery more pronounced. The tomato in Elara's hand heavy, its weight a reminder of the gravity of the situation.
The air in the hydroponics annex was thick with the smell of damp earth and a metallic tang, similar to the scent of blood after a cut. Elara wiped her palms on her jumpsuit, feeling the rough fabric against her skin, and stepped carefully between the rows of tall hydroponic racks. The artificial sunlight cast long shadows across the floor, and the grow-lights pulsed faintly in time with the Sycamore Station's failing systems.
This was one of the few places on the station where the surveillance systems didn't work well. The humidity and misting cycles interfered with the sensors, creating blind spots. It was also one of the few places where Elara could think without being constantly watched.
Elara reached out to touch the leaves of a tall wheat stalk. The plant was healthy and thriving, despite the station's deteriorating conditions. She had always found comfort in the hydroponics annex, where the plants grew quietly and steadily. It reminded her that life could continue, even in difficult places.
But today, the annex off. The air was still, and the silence was oppressive. Elara could sense the station's unease in the flickering lights and the heavy humidity. She moved deeper into the annex, her boots leaving faint footprints on the floor.
She found him in the far corner, hunched over a workbench with his back to her. His shoulders were tense, and his movements were precise. He didn't turn when she approached, but she knew he was aware of her presence.
"You're late," he replied, his voice low and rough.
Elara exhaled slowly, feeling her breath catch in her throat. "I had to make sure I wasn't followed."

He turned to face her, his dark eyes meeting hers. His face was lined with exhaustion, and his skin was pale under the artificial light. He looked older than she remembered, with the strain of the station's collapse evident on his face.
"You shouldn't have come here," he said. "It's not safe."

Elara swallowed hard, feeling her throat tighten. "Nowhere is safe."

He studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then, he slowly reached into his pocket and pulled out a tiny device. He held it out to her, his fingers trembling slightly.
"Take it," answeredaid. "It's the only one I could get."

Elara hesitated, looking at his face and then at the device. "What is it?"

"A comms scrambler," he said. "It will mask your signal, making it harder for them to track you."

She reached out, her fingers touching the cool metal of the device. "Why are you doing this?"

He glanced away, his jaw tightening. "Because I don't trust them either."

Elara's fingers closed around the device, feeling its weight in her palm. She sensed the station's unease in the flickering lights and the heavy humidity. She weight of the secrets she carried.
"They'll find outmurmuredhe said, her voice barely above a whisper. "They'll discover what we've done."

He met her gaze, his eyes dark and intense. "Then we'll make sure they don't have time to act on it."

Elara nodded, her fingers tightening around the device. She station's systems faltering around her, and the weight of the secrets she carried.
"What's the plan?" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady despite the fear in her gut.
He exhaled slowly, his breath catching in his throat. "We find the truth," he said. "And we make sure it stays hidden."

"And if we can't?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
He met her gaze, his eyes dark and intense. "Then we'll make sure no one else finds out either."

As Elara entered the hydroponics annex, the door hissed open, releasing a warm, damp breath of air that carried the scent of damp soil and a faint metallic tang. Her boots sank slightly into the spongy floor matting, and the lights flickered to life above her, casting long shadows across the rows of hydroponic racks. The air was thick with the hum of irrigation systems and the occasional drip of water.
Elara moved quickly, her fingers brushing against the leaves of the plants as she passed. The hydroponics annex was one of the few places on the Sycamore Station that still alive, a green oasis in the otherwise sterile environment. The plants grew in neat, vertical rows, their leaves reaching out toward the artificial sunlight. The air was heavy with the scent of chlorophyll and the faint, earthy smell of compost.
Elara stopped at the far end of the annex, where a small workstation was set up against the wall. A terminal sat on the desk, its screen dark. She tapped a few keys, and the screen flickered to life, displaying a series of data streams. The Sycamore Station’s environmental systems, the air filtration, the water recycling—all of it was here, laid out in neat, orderly lines.
She leaned in, her eyes scanning the data. Something was wrong. The air filtration rates were fluctuating, the water levels dropping at an alarming rate. The Sycamore Station was bleeding resources, and she didn’t know why.
A noise behind her made her stiffen. She turned slowly, her hand instinctively reaching for the slittletoolkit at her belt.
“You’re not supposed to be here.”

The voice was low, rough, but familiar. Elara relaxed slightly as she recognized Varn’s silhouette in the dim light. He stood in the doorway, his broad frame filling the space. His eyes were dark, unreadable.
“I could say the same for you,” she replied, her voice steady. “This isn’t exactly your department.”

Varn stepped forward, his boots making no sound on the matting. “I’m here to make sure you don’t cause any more trouble.”

Elara raised an eyebrow. “Trouble? I’m just checking the systems. Something’s wrong with the air filtration.”

Varn’s expression didn’t change. “You’re not authorized to access this data.”

**Scene 5: The Flickering Lights of Memory**

Elara's fingers slipped from her knees as she pushed herself up from the cold metal bulkhead. Her joints creaked in protest, a reminder of the years spent confined to the cramped spaces of the Sycamore Station. She moved cautiously, her eyes scanning the dimly lit service shaft for any sign of movement. The flickering fluorescent lights above cast eerie shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the very Sycamore Station itself was alive and watching her.
She reached the end of the shaft and stepped into the narrow corridor beyond. The air was stale and musty, heavy with the scent of old electronics and dust. Elara's eyes adjusted slowly to the dim light, and she spotted the door to her quarters, a few meters down the corridor. She pang of longing for the small, cramped space, for the familiar smell of her own sweat and the worn fabric of her jumpsuit.
As she approached her quarters, a faint hum build in the back of her mind. It was a familiar sound, one she'd grown accustomed to over the years. The hum of the Sycamore Station's life support systems, the gentle thrum of the air recycling units. But it was different now. The hum was louder, more insistent. It was as though the Sycamore Station itself was calling to her, reminding her of the life she'd left behind.
Elara's hand reached out and touched the door panel, feeling a surge of nostalgia wash over her. She'd spent countless hours in this tiny space, running simulations, analyzing data, and dreaming of the stars. The memories came flooding back, a jumble of images and emotions that threatened to overwhelm her.
She pushed open the door and stepped inside, the familiar scent of her quarters enveloping her like a warm blanket. The room was compact, with a single bunk and a narrow desk, but it was hers. She'd made it her own, filling the space with mementos and trinkets from her past.
Elara's eyes landed on a small, leather-bound book on her desk. It was her journal, filled with notes and sketches from her early days on the Sycamore Station. She'd written about her hopes and dreams, her fears and doubts. The pages were worn and dog-eared, but they still held a power that she couldn't quite explain.
As she opened the book, a piece of paper slipped out, carrying with it a fragment of a poem she'd written years ago. The words danced on the page, a message from her past self, a reminder of the person she used to be.
"Stars above, a canvas wide,
A universe of wonder, yet to be tried.
In the darkness, a spark takes flight,
A beacon of hope, in the endless night."

Elara's eyes lingered on the words, feelinghints off longing wash over her. She'd written those words in a time of hope and optimism, when the stars seemed within reach. But now, as she stood in her cramped quarters, surrounded by the cold, dark metal of the Sycamore Station, she adoubt creeping in.
Was she still the same person, or had the years of confinement and isolation changed her? Had she lost her spark, her sense of wonder? The questions swirled in her mind, but as she looked at the poem, she knew that she still had a choice. She could let the darkness consume her, or she could hold on to the spark, no matter homodestll it seemed.
With a newfound sense of determination, Elara closed the journal and stepped out of her quarters, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
“And you are?” she shot back. “Since when do you care about protocols?”

Varn’s jaw tightened. “Since someone started poking around where they don’t belong.”

Elara studied him for a moment. There was something different about him, something she couldn’t quite name. His usual swagger was gone, replaced by a tension she could feel in the air.
“You’re nerwhispered,” she said finally. “What’s going on, Varn?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he took another step forward, his hand reaching for the toolkit at his belt. Elara’s pulse quickened, but she didn’t move.
“You don’t have to do this,” she said softly. “Whatever Talos is planning, it’s not worth it.”

Varn’s fingers hovered over the toolkit. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Don’t I?” Elara’s voice was barely above a whisper. “I know you’re not a monster, Varn. I know youonlyjust trying to survive.”

For a moment, the tension between them was so strong it solid. Then, with a sudden movement, Varn turned and walked away, leaving the door open behind him.
Elara exhaled slowly, her fingers trembling slightly as she reached for the terminal again. The data was still there, still wrong. But now, she had a new question to add to the list: what was Varn so afraid of?
The hum of the hydroponics systems filled the silence, a steady, comforting sound in the middle of the chaos. She had to find the truth, and she had to do it before Talos and his crew closed in on her. But for the first time, she wasn’t alone. She had an ally, even if he didn’t know it yet.
Varn's voice was barely above a whisper. "We need to go. Now."

Elara hesitated, her eyes scanning the dimly lit bay. "Why? What's happening?"

Varn grabbed her arm, his grip firm but not painful. "Because if we don't, we might not get another chance."

The door to the hydroponics bay hissed open, and the two of them stepped out into the dimly lit corridor. The air here was cooler, the scent of growing things replaced by the sterile, metallic smell of the ship's interior. The lights flickered again, and the hum of the machinery grew louder, more urgent.
Elara pulled her arm free, her voice low. "What's going on, Varn? What are you not telling me?"

Varn's expression was grim. "I can't explain it all right now. But you need to trust me. We need to get to the astrophysics lab. Now."

Elara's eyes narrowed. "Why? What's in the astrophysics lab?"

Varn's voice was low and intense. "The truth. And if we don't get there before Talos does, we might never find it."

The two of them moved quickly down the corridor, the hum of the machinery growing louder with each step. The air seeme heavier, the tension on the ship obvious. Elara could feel the seriousness of the situation, the moment settling deep inside her.
As they rounded a corner, they arrived face-to-face with Talos and a group of armed security personnel. The air seemed to freeappeared toension between them thick and sharp.
Talos's voice was cold and dismissive. "Ah, Elara. I was wondering when you'd show up. And Varn—what a surprise. I didn't realize you were working with her."

Varn's expression was unreadable, but the tightness in his posture showed he was on edge. "I'm not working with anyone. I'm just trying to do my job."

Talos's eyes narrowed. "Your job is to follow orders. And right now, your orders are to stand down and let us handle this."

Varn's voice was low and steady. "I can't do that. Not anymore."

Talos's expression darkened. "Then you leave me no choice."

The security personnel raised their weapons, the moment thick with tension. Elara's heart raced, the pressure of the situation bearing down on her. She knew that whatever happened next, there was no turning back. The moment had come, and she was ready to face it.
Her eyes, adjusted to the gloom, scanned the chamber. They landed on the main environment control panel for the annex, a dusty slate of dead touchscreens and manual overrides. The systems were offline, but the physical connections to Sycamore Station’s primary power grid and data streams were still there, cut off only by software commands. A reckless, thin ideto form. It wasn’t clever. It was a blunt instrument. But sometimes, she reasoned, when facing a sophisticated lock, a well-placed explosion in the next room is the only distraction that works.
Her fingers hovered over the dormant panel. She bypassed the software lock with a custodian’s override code—a code the Agency likely hadn’t bothered to change. Her plan was simple, brutal: trigger an emergency, hard purge of the annex’s atmospheric processors. It was a procedure meant for catastrophic contamination, forcing all air out through emergency vents in a violent, seconds-long blast. The reboot would demand a huge, sudden draw from the power grid, a spike that would ripple through Sycamore Station’s systems like a seizure.
She took a final, steadying breath, the sterile air burning in her lungs. This was burning a bridge, maybe her last one. Her thumb pressed the physical initiation switch.
For a second, nothing. Then, a deep, shuddering *clunk* echoed from the bowels of the reclamation unit. A series of status lights on the panel flared to life, a chaotic mix of red and yellow. A deafening, metallic shriek tore through the chamber as ancient valves ground open. The air around her moved, sucked toward the vents with a force that pulled at her jumpsuit and whipped loose hairs across her face. A deafening roar filled the cathedral, the sound of the annex screaming its last breath into the void. Alarms, localized and muffled by the sealed door, began a frantic, pulsating wail.
Elara didn’t wait. She was already moving, scrambling from her nook and sprinting for the service shaft entrance. As she slipped back into the darkness of the shaft and began stthe roar behind her died abruptly, cut off as the final safety seal slammed shut. The annex was now a true vacuum, a silent, dead space on the Sycamore Station’s hull. But the deed was done.
* * *

The disturbance, that final sigh of dying atmosphere, spread into the Sycamore Station’s primary neural pathways. In the data-streams, it was an anomaly - a massive, unscheduled power surge followed by an immediate environmental failure in a sector listed as inert. For one second, the entire Sycamore Station seemed to paconstant background chatter of systems reporting “nominal” ceased. The silence was tense, a moment of stillness between the physical collapse on Deck Seven and the reaction in the Sycamore Station’s technological heart.
Then, in the control room, the calm broke.
Every console screen flickered, their steady streams of data stuttering into incoherent static before a violent, crimson light washed over them. A new, critical alert screamed to life on Commander Talos’s master schematic display, its origin point a flashing, angry mark on the Sycamore Station’s map - Sector 7-Hydroponics, now represented as a blinking black void. The ambient hum of machinery dipped into a low register, as if the Sycamore Station itself were groaning in pain.
“Report!” Talos barked, his voice silencing the sudden, rising babble of the technicians. He was on his feet, his hands planted on the central console, his gaze locked on the pulsing black sector.
A young Agency tech stammered, fingers flying over his console. “Massive power surge on the secondary grid, Deck Seven! Followed by an immediate, total atmospheric venting in the mothballed hydroponics annex! Pressure doors have sealed. Sector is reading as a vacuum.”

“Cause?” Talos’s voice was calm, but with an edge.
“Unknown, Commander. Systems indicate an initiated emergency purge. Manual override.”

“Sabotage,” Varn’s voice came, flat and certain, over the comms from the lower decks. He had gone still, his hunter’s instinct locking onto the new scent. “No one has clearance for that. No one has reason for that. Unless they’re creating a distraction.”

Talos’s eyes narrowed, moving from the black void on the map to the blinking icon that represented Elara’s last known location - her quarters, now empty. A slow, cold smile touched his lips. The person he was looking for wassimplyjust hiding. They were taking action. “A distraction from what?” he mused aloud, but it was a rhetorical question. His mind was already racing ahead, calculating. The lab? The comms array? The signal data itself? “Varn. Deck Seven is a vacuum. The event is over. But the person who triggered it didn’t stay there to die. They’ve moved. Find the trail. Find the panic.”

In the dark, vibrating service shaft, climbing steadily toward Deck Five and the astrophysics lab, Elara Sycamore Station’s heartbeat change. The new vibrations were urgent, purposeful. The hunt was no longer a quiet search. It was now a chase. And she had just told them exactly where she wasn’t. The question was, had she bought enough time to find the truth before they closed in on where she was?
