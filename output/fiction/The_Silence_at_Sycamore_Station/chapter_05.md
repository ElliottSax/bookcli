Chapter 5

Chapter 6

The silence in her quarters was not the silence of the Sycamore Station. That had been a living thing, a presence in the wires and the empty spaces. This was the dead quiet of a sealed box. Elara stood at the viewport until the cold from the composite glass seeped through her sleeves and into her skin. The stars didn’t care. They were just there, a static backdrop to a decision that felt like a physical tilt in the universe.

She had eleven hours.

The numbness Varn had seen began to crack, not into panic, but into a cold, sharp clarity. Talos saw artifacts. Varn saw data layers. She saw the line and the thing at the other end. And she was locked in a box while the hand reached for the reel.

Her eyes scanned the room. Standard Agency quarters: a bunk, a desk fused to the wall, a personal data terminal—dark now, its access severed—a small sanitizer unit, a closet for her jumpsuits. A prison with good lighting. Her gaze snagged on the desk. Not the terminal, but the surface. It was a matte, grey polymer. When she’d first been assigned here, she’d found a hairline scratch near the edge, a faint imperfection. She’d always meant to buff it out. She never had.

Elara walked over and ran her finger along the scratch. Then she pressed down, hard, at the scratch’s terminus near the wall. There was a minute, almost imperceptible give. She knelt, her cheek against the cool floor, and looked at the desk’s undercarriage. A slim, flush panel was barely visible. Every Sycamore Station custodian of a certain generation knew the rumours about the Sycamore-class outposts. They were built during the Fracture Wars, designed to be hardened against takeover. The rumours spoke of blind spots, of maintenance conduits not on the official schematics, of places a Sycamore Station’s keeper could hide or move if the unthinkable happened.

She’d always dismissed it as lore. But in her first month, bored and thorough, she’d mapped the Sycamore Station’s thermal variances against the blueprints. There was a discrepancy here, in this wall. A narrow, vertical channel of slightly different heat dissipation that corresponded to nothing. She’d never reported it. It felt like a secret the Sycamore Station had chosen to share with her.

Elara stood and examined the wall beside the desk. It was seamless. She pressed her palms flat against it, starting high, moving down. On the third pass, at waist height, a section about thirty centimeters wide gave inwards with a soft, pneumatic sigh. It wasn’t a door. It was an access slot, revealing a vertical shaft barely wider than her shoulders, with recessed grips leading down into darkness. A cold, metallic smell wafted out, the scent of undisturbed air and ozone.

Talos had locked down the systems. She hadn’t thought to look for the Sycamore Station’s bones.

Elara didn’t hesitate. She slid into the shaft, pulling the panel closed behind her. It sealed with a faint click, plunging her into absolute black. The grips were cold, rough under her fingers. She descended, counting. Twenty meters down, her feet found another panel. It opened onto a narrow service crawlway, lit by the faint, emergency glow of bioluminescent strips along the baseboards. The air was chill and still.

She knew this Sycamore Station. Every conduit, every whisper of its ventilation. This crawlway ran parallel to the main spinal corridor, bypassing the habitation ring. It would lead her close to the auxiliary control nexus, a redundant hub rarely used, its systems isolated from CHIRP’s main network. If she could get there, she might be able to see what they were doing. She might be able to do more than see.

The crawl was a journey of pressure and silence. The ceiling brushed her back. The dim light turned her hands a sickly green. All she could hear was the rustle of her jumpsuit and the hammering of her own heart. She wasn’t a strategist or a soldier. She was a custodian. Her rebellion was made of stolen moments and forgotten passages.

It took forty minutes of slow, careful movement to reach the access point for the nexus. The panel here was secured with a manual bolt. She turned it, the sound grotesquely loud in the confined space, and slid into a small, dark room.

The auxiliary nexus was a tomb of dead technology. Consoles sat dark under dust covers. The only light came from a single status panel, a constellation of amber and green LEDs showing the health of independent life support and gravity plating. In the corner, shrouded in a grey sheet, was the old comms array. It was a pre-CHIRP system, hard-wired, analog. It couldn’t tap into the Agency’s secure channels, but it could listen. And it could broadcast on a handful of archaic, unsecured bands.

Elara pulled off the sheet in a cloud of dust. The console was solid, physical. Switches, dials, a cracked plastic seat. She powered it up. It groaned to life, tubes warming with a faint orange glow, screens flickering with scrolling lines of static. She put on the heavy, cushioned headset. The world shrank to the hiss in her ears.

She tuned through the bands. Agency traffic was encrypted, a digital garble. But the raw feed from the lab… that might be carried on internal, low-security carriers. She filtered, focused, her fingers fine-tuning dials with a custodian’s practiced touch.

A voice crackled through the static, sharp and clear.

“—final calibration of the harmonic amplifier. Talos wants the broadcast pulse to mimic the ghost signal’s decay envelope exactly. No deviations.”

It was a tech she didn’t recognize. Another voice, younger, anxious, replied. “The power draw is already pushing the secondary capacitors. If we mimic the decay, the tail-end of the pulse will bleed into the Sycamore Station’s own dampening field frequency.”

“Not our problem. We follow the waveform. The dampening field is Varn’s department. Proceed.”

Elara listened, her stomach a knot of ice. They weren’t just sending a signal. They were crafting a precise echo, a perfect copy of the ghost. They were trying to make the main signal think it was hearing itself reflected back from somewhere deep in the void. A call and response, engineered by Talos. It was infinitely more reckless than she’d imagined.

She switched bands, searching. She found Varn’s channel. It was quieter.

“—confirm the dampening field is at ninety-seven percent optimal,” he was saying, his voice flat, professional. “The bleed they’re generating will cause a two-point-three percent oscillation in the field integrity. Contained, but unstable.”

“Understood, Specialist,” CHIRP’s voice replied, devoid of its usual warmth. It was pure function here. “Shall I log a formal caution for the mission record?”

A pause. Elara could almost see him, in the cramped security hub, weighing duty against truth.

“Log it,” Varn said, finally. “Categorize it as a minor systems anomaly. No need to flag command.”

“Logged.”

So he was covering. For Talos, or for himself? Or was he just smoothing the path for the inevitable, minimizing noise in the data stream?

Elara sat back, the headset heavy. She could listen. She could bear witness. But the crawlway, the nexus, the dust—they had ignited something older than duty in her. This was her Sycamore Station. Her silence. They were using her home as the firing pin of a weapon aimed into the dark.

On a lower band, she found the raw output feed. It was a screech of data, a waterfall of numbers on a screen, but beneath it, translated into audio, was the sound. The ghost. The lonely, repeating chime. And beneath that, like a shadow taking shape, was the new pulse, the engineered echo, being tuned and polished. Hearing them together was wrong. The ghost had a purity, a singular, mournful identity. The echo was a mimic, a puppet, its edges too sharp, its soul made of mathematics and ambition.

An idea, terrible and simple, formed.

The old array couldn’t interfere with the Agency’s systems. But it could broadcast. On one particular, nearly forgotten band: the Custodial Emergency Frequency. It was a relic, a homing light for Sycamore Station keepers in the event of a total comms collapse. No one monitored it. But every Sycamore Station, every Agency vessel, had a receiver for it, deep in their core systems, a last-resort ear that was always on.

She could send a warning. Not to Talos. To the Sycamore Station. To CHIRP’s deepest, most automatic listening post. A warning not in data, but in sound.

Her hands were steady as she reconfigured the array. She patched the audio feed from the ghost signal directly into the transmitter. She set the CEF to broadcast. But she didn’t send the ghost as it was. She used the old console’s primitive filters to strip it down. To isolate its core frequency, the empty heart of its chime. Then, with a clumsy, analog delay loop, she made it stutter. She broke its perfect rhythm. She made it sound like a thing in distress, a signal not just repeating, but faltering.

It was a lie. A manipulation. It made her feel sick. But Talos was building a prettier, more dangerous lie. Elara was speaking in the only language the abyss might understand: imperfection.

She took a breath, and opened the channel.

Out in the crawlway, in the walls, in the very foundations of Sycamore Station, a whisper-thin signal began to pulse. Not through the main speakers, but through the emergency grilles, through the vibration of old pipes. A broken chime. A heartbeat skipping.

It lasted thirty seconds. She killed the transmission. The nexus returned to the hiss of static. She sat in the dark, waiting for alarms, for the thunder of boots in the corridor above.

Nothing.

Either it had been swallowed by the Sycamore Station’s bulk, or it had been received and logged as a minor anomaly by a subsystem no one was watching. A ghost of a ghost.

She was about to disconnect when Varn’s voice came back over the headset, tight with a new tension.

“CHIRP, run a diagnostic on the Sycamore Station’s foundational resonance. I’m reading a… flutter. In the gravity plating sub-strata.”

“Diagnostic initiated,” CHIRP replied. A few seconds passed. “No anomalies detected in gravity systems. However, a transient audio signal was detected on the Custodial Emergency Frequency, duration twenty-nine point six seconds. Signal source unlocatable. Content appears to be a degraded version of Subject Gamma’s emission.”

Another, longer pause.

“Ignore it,” Varn said, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “Archive it in the deep storage buffer. Don’t flag it. Don’t mention it.”

“Archived. Specialist Varn, your biometrics indicate elevated stress levels. Shall I—”

“I’m fine. Maintain focus on the primary mission. Talos’s countdown is now at nine hours twenty. Keep me apprised of the dampening field stability.”

Elara removed the headset. Her hands were trembling now. He’d heard it. He’d buried it. Why?

The crawl back was a blur. She moved on instinct, the cold of the shaft a shock as she climbed. She emerged into her quarters, sealing the panel behind her, and stood in the middle of the room, her clothes smelling of dust and cold metal. The viewport showed the same stars. The lock on her door was still engaged.

But everything had changed. She had acted. And Varn, the perfect specialist, had chosen to look away.

Four hours later, the door hissed open. Varn stood there, a tray of food in his hands. His face was a careful mask.

“Your meal, Custodian.” He stepped inside, the door closing behind him. He set the tray on the desk, over the hairline scratch. He didn’t look at her.

“The preparation is on schedule,” he said, his voice formal. “The amplifier will be ready to transmit in five hours.”

Varn's eyes flicked between the viewport and the service ladder shaft, his grip on the sidearm tightening. Elara's frozen posture was a stark contrast to his own tense, coiled energy. The scraping drag had grown louder, the sound of metal scraping against metal echoing through the Sycamore Station's corridors.

"Get down," Varn whispered, his voice barely audible over the creaking of the metal.

Elara's gaze remained fixed on the viewport, her eyes tracing the stars as if searching for a lifeline. Her face was a mask of calm, but Varn knew better. He'd seen the crack in her armor, the glimmer of panic beneath the surface.

Varn slid down beside her, his movements swift and silent. He pressed himself against the wall, his sidearm trained on the service ladder shaft. The scraping drag had slowed, and an oppressive silence had fallen over the Sycamore Station.

The air was heavy with the scent of ozone and burned metal. Elara's eyes finally met Varn's, a flicker of understanding passing between them. They were both thinking the same thing: this was no ordinary malfunction.

The silence was oppressive, punctuated only by the soft hum of the Sycamore Station's life support systems. Varn's earpiece crackled to life, the voice of their Sycamore Station's AI, LUMINA, echoing through the comms system.

"LUMINA, this is Varn. We have a situation. Report any anomalies."

The pause that followed was longer than Varn had expected. LUMINA's voice was laced with a hint of unease.

"Varn, I'm reading...anomalous energy signatures emanating from the service ladder shaft. I'm attempting to isolate the source."

Varn's eyes never left the shaft. "Keep trying, LUMINA. We need to know what we're dealing with."

Varn's hand hovered over the grip of his sidearm, his eyes fixed on the service ladder shaft. The scraping drag had stopped, and an oppressive silence had fallen over the Sycamore Station. Elara remained frozen, her cheek pressed against the cold floor, her eyes fixed on the flush panel she'd discovered.

The air was heavy with anticipation, the only sound the soft hum of the Sycamore Station's life support systems. Varn's gaze flicked to Elara, his expression a mixture of concern and curiosity. "You okay?" he whispered, his voice barely audible over the Sycamore Station's background noise.

Elara slowly stood up, her movements stiff and controlled. She didn't respond, her eyes still fixed on the panel. Varn's hand tightened around his sidearm, his finger hovering over the trigger. He knew better than to act without Elara's signal.

The silence stretched out, the tension building with each passing moment. Elara's eyes never left the panel, her face a mask of concentration. Varn's mind was racing, trying to piece together what was happening. The line had been tugged, and something had come over the side. But what?

The Sycamore Station's intercom crackled to life, the voice of the AI, S.A.R.A., echoing through the corridors. "Attention, personnel. This is S.A.R.A. We have a situation. Reports are coming in of an unknown entity breaching the Sycamore Station's outer hull. All personnel are advised to remain in their quarters and follow all instructions from Sycamore Station security."

Elara's eyes snapped to the viewport as the scraping sound grew louder, a relentless, screeching drag that seemed to claw its way through the metal. Varn's sidearm was still trained on the service ladder shaft, his face a mask of tense focus. She felt a shiver run down her spine as the first tendrils of a low, thrumming hum began to seep into the air, a vibration that seemed to resonate deep within her bones.

The hum built in intensity, until it was almost a living thing, a pulsing, electric presence that seemed to fill the room. Elara's skin prickled with gooseflesh as she felt the air around her begin to distort, as if reality itself was bending to accommodate the thing that was coming.

She took a step back, her eyes fixed on the viewport as a dark, amorphous shape began to coalesce in the depths of the Sycamore Station's corridors. It was a mass of twisted, nightmarish limbs, each one ending in a jagged, serrated edge that seemed to be designed for tearing flesh. The scraping sound grew louder still, until it was almost deafening, and Elara felt her heart racing in her chest as the thing began to take shape.

It was a creature unlike any she had ever seen, a twisted, eldritch monstrosity that seemed to be made of some dark, otherworldly material that defied the laws of physics. As it moved, its limbs seemed to blur and shift, like a living, breathing thing that was constantly in motion.

Varn's sidearm was still trained on the creature, but Elara could see the doubt in his eyes. He was a man who had faced down countless dangers in his line of work, but this was something different. This was a creature that seemed to be from a realm beyond their own, a realm that was both ancient and eternal.

The creature's gaze seemed to lock onto Elara, and she felt a jolt of fear run through her veins. It was a gaze that was both cold and calculating, a gaze that seemed to see right through her. She felt a shiver run down her spine as the creature began to move towards her, its limbs twitching and flexing in a way that seemed to be both hypnotic and terrifying.

Varn's voice was low and steady, but Elara could hear the fear lurking beneath the surface. "Elara, get back," he said, his eyes never leaving the creature. "I've got this."

But Elara was frozen in place, her eyes fixed on the creature as it moved closer and closer. She felt a sense of wonder and awe wash over her, a sense of being in the presence of something truly ancient and powerful.

As the creature drew closer, Elara felt a sense of calm wash over her. She knew that she was in the presence of something that was beyond human comprehension, something that was both beautiful and terrifying.

And in that moment, she knew that she was ready to face whatever lay ahead.

Varn's grip on his sidearm tightened. He knew that S.A.R.A.'s voice was a warning, not a threat. But the words sent a shiver down his spine. An unknown entity? What did that even mean?

Elara's eyes finally flickered up, her gaze meeting Varn's. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the only sound the soft hum of the Sycamore Station's systems. Then, without a word, Elara turned and walked back to her bunk, her movements swift and decisive.

Varn followed, his sidearm still at the ready. As they reached the bunk, Elara pulled out a small, sleek device from her pocket and pressed a button. The device emitted a high-pitched whine, and the air around them began to vibrate. The sound was like nothing Varn had ever heard before, a mixture of white noise and something almost...musical.

The vibrations grew stronger, and the air seemed to thicken, like a physical presence was building around them. Varn's skin prickled with unease, his heart racing in his chest. He knew that Elara was trying to do something, but he had no idea what.

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the device fell silent. The vibrations ceased, and the air returned to its normal state. Elara stood up, her eyes locked on Varn's. "We need to get out of here," she said, her voice low and urgent. "Now."

Varn nodded, his mind racing with questions. What had just happened? What was Elara trying to do? And what was coming for them?

The scraping drag had resumed, this time slower and more deliberate. It was as if whatever was making the noise was savoring the moment, enjoying the fear that was building in Varn's chest.

Elara's gaze had shifted to the viewport once more, her eyes tracing the stars as if searching for a way out. Varn knew she was thinking the same thing: escape was their only option.

But escape was impossible. They were trapped, locked in a Sycamore Station with a malfunctioning AI and a creature that seemed to be toying with them.

The scraping drag had slowed to a crawl, and an expectant silence had fallen over the Sycamore Station. Varn's heart was pounding in his chest, his senses on high alert. He knew that whatever was making the noise was about to make its move.

And when it did, Varn and Elara would be ready.

Or so he hoped.

The silence was broken by a faint creaking sound, like the slow opening of a door. Varn's eyes snapped to the service ladder shaft, his sidearm at the ready.

And then, a sliver of light appeared, casting an eerie glow over the Sycamore Station's corridors.

Varn's breath caught in his throat as a figure began to emerge from the darkness, its presence seeming to fill the entire Sycamore Station.

The line had been tugged, and something had not just answered. It had come over the side, and it was coming for them.

Elara said nothing. She watched him.

He finally met her eyes. “It’s a beautiful piece of engineering. The waveform match is… perfect. Talos is pleased.” He said the last word like it was a clinical observation.

“And the dampening field?” Elara asked, her voice rough from disuse.

“Stable. Within parameters.” He glanced at the viewport. “The specialist who ran the initial verification check… he was thorough. He found all the data there was to find.” He paused. “But a good custodian knows a Sycamore Station has moods. Sounds that aren’t in the schematics. Feelings in the metal.”

He was speaking in code. A code she understood.

“Feelings can be wrong,” she said.

“They can,” he agreed. “But they’re often the first sign of a pressure change. Before the sensors register it.” He turned to leave, then stopped. “When the broadcast initiates, all non-essential systems will be routed to auxiliary power. Including internal security monitors in the residential block. For approximately ninety seconds. A glitch. It happens in complex operations.” He didn’t look back. “Eat your food, Custodian. You should have your strength.”

He left. The door locked again.

Elara looked at the tray. Next to the nutrient pack was a small, metallic object. A manual door override key, the kind used by maintenance crews during power failures. Non-electronic. Untraceable.

He wasn’t just looking away. He was giving her a chance.

The numbness was gone, burned away by a current of pure, terrifying purpose. The next hours were agony. She paced. She watched the stars. She thought of the ghost, her ghost, and the flawless, arrogant copy they had made of it. She thought of Varn, a man who trusted instruments betting on a feeling.

When the Sycamore Station-wide alert chimed, her body went rigid.

“All personnel,” Talos’s voice echoed, calm and absolute. “Initiate final sequence for Operation Echo. T-minus sixty seconds to primary broadcast. Assume protocol positions. May we be heard.”

Elara’s hand closed around the cold metal key. She moved to her door, ear pressed against it. She heard the distant thrum of the Sycamore Station’s power core diverting energy, a deep vibrational shift that travelled up through the deck plates into her bones. The lights in her room flickered, dimmed to a emergency amber, and then brightened again.

The security panel beside her door went dark.

Now.

She slid the key into a nearly invisible slot beneath the panel and turned. There was a solid, satisfying clunk. She pushed, and the door slid open into an empty, silent corridor. The security cameras along the ceiling were dark, their red activity lights extinguished.

She ran.

She didn’t go towards the lab. That was Talos’s ground. She went down, towards the core, towards the dampening field generators. If she could destabilize them, even slightly, increase the oscillation Varn had warned about, it might distort the broadcast. It might turn their perfect echo into a cracked mirror. It was a slim chance. A custodian’s chance.

The service ladder to the lower engineering bay was where she remembered. She descended into a world of noise and heat and light. The giant cylindrical generators hummed, caged behind reinforced screens. Status panels flashed with torrents of data. And there, in the center of the room, stood Varn. He was at a master control console, his back to her, his attention fixed on a screen showing the dampening field matrix. It was a shimmering, blue dome of energy overlaid on a schematic of the Sycamore Station. At its edge, a ripple of yellow pulsed—the bleed from the amplifier.

He heard her footsteps on the grating and turned. He didn’t look surprised.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he said, but there was no force in it.

“Neither should you,” she said, her voice barely carrying over the hum. “You’re supposed to be in the security hub.”

“I delegated.” He looked back at the screen. “Field integrity is holding at ninety-four percent. The oscillation is… contained.” He said the last word like a question.

Elara went to a secondary panel, her fingers flying over the controls. She called up the raw gravitational compensator logs. “If we overcharge the subspace harmonic buffers in sectors seven and nine, we can induce a sympathetic vibration in the field. It’ll amplify the oscillation. Make the bleed… louder.”

“It could also collapse the field entirely on the Sycamore Station’s port side,” Varn said, staring at her. “Exposing us to whatever backlash comes.”

“Or it could scramble their echo just enough. Make it sound less like a perfect copy. More like a mistake.” She held his gaze. “You heard my broadcast. You know it’s not just a signal. It’s a thing. And we’re about to poke it with a stick. Do you want the stick to be perfect?”

A voice boomed from the comms grille overhead. Talos. “Broadcast in ten. Nine. Eight.”

Varn looked from Elara to the pulsing yellow ripple on his screen. The professional detachment in his eyes shattered. He saw the fishing line. He saw the deep, black sea.

“Do it,” he said.

Elara’s hands moved. She rerouted power, bypassed safeties. Alarms shrieked on her panel, local, ignored. On the main screen, the blue dome of the dampening field developed a visible, pulsing bulge where the yellow met it, like a soap bubble stressed to its limit.

“Three. Two. One. Initiate.”

The sound was not a sound. It was a pressure. A sudden, profound weight in the air, in the teeth, in the marrow of the bones. The Sycamore Station itself seemed to groan. The lights dipped, then flared. The ghost signal, magnified a billionfold by the Agency’s amplifier, shot out from Sycamore Station, a spear of perfect, patterned silence hurled into the void.

For three seconds, nothing.

Then, the dampening field, stressed by Elara’s sabotage, reacted. It didn’t collapse. It resonated. It took the flawless, outgoing echo and sheared its edge, adding a faint, chaotic tremor to its final decay, a whisper of distortion like a voice cracking.

On the main console, a new screen lit up. Incoming data. The main signal. The tombstone.

It was changing.

The steady, eternal pulse began to quicken. Not much. A fractional increase in tempo. And within its structure, new sub-harmonics bloomed, complex and jagged. It was no longer just a chime. It was a chime with an echo of its own, an echo that sounded disturbingly like the distorted tail of Talos’s broadcast.

“It’s… parsing,” Varn whispered, horror and awe in his voice. “It heard the imperfection.”

Talos’s voice cut through, sharp with triumph. “We have a response! Pattern shift confirmed! The subject is interactive!”

But on Elara’s panel, a different reading was spiking. Not from the distant source. From much, much closer.

“Varn,” she said, her blood going cold.

He saw it. Gravimetric sensors, pointed at the space just outside the Sycamore Station’s hull, were detecting an anomaly. A localized bending of space. It was tiny, a pinprick. But it was moving. Drifting towards the Sycamore Station.

“Something’s here,” he said. “It’s not the source. It’s… a piece of it. A splinter.”

The main signal’s pulse continued to quicken, the new harmonics weaving into a pattern that felt less like communication and more like a slow, deliberate unraveling.

The thing outside, the splinter, reached the Sycamore Station’s hull. There was no impact. No sound. But every screen in the engineering bay flickered. CHIRP’s voice, when it came, was broken, digitized.

“Unauthorized… intrusion… in… lower… archives… Life… signs… non… human…”

The lights failed. The hum of the generators died. For a heartbeat, there was only the deep, vibrational thrum of the main signal, now inside their heads, and the chilling, absolute darkness.

Then, the emergency bioluminescent strips glowed to life, painting the world in ghostly green.

Varn was already moving, drawing a sidearm from his hip. Elara stood frozen, listening.

From the service ladder shaft, from the darkness above them, came a new sound. A slow, deliberate, scraping drag. Like something heavy, with edges that didn’t quite fit their world, was pulling itself through the metal corridors of her Sycamore Station.

The line had been tugged. And something had not just answered.

It had come over the side.
