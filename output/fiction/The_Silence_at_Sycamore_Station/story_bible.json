      "role": "Protagonist; sole technician and caretaker of Sycamore Station.",

      "arc": "From a lonely guardian maintaining a silent, broken network, to a pioneer of first contact. She moves from dismissing her perceptions to trusting them, ultimately becoming a bridge-builder and translator between humanity and a completely alien consciousness."

      "arc": "From a silent, watching presence perceived as a threat or hallucination, to a revealed entity seeking communion. Its arc is one of reaching out, from observation to active, vulnerable communication, offering an invitation rather than a solution."

  "plot_summary": "Elara, the sole human operator of the decrepit Sycamore Station, maintains a vast, silent communications network. Haunted by fleeting anomalies she dismisses as debris, she eventually makes a deliberate, risky physical contact with the system. This act triggers a surge of alien consciousness\u2014the Entity\u2014that has been watching through the network. The contact draws the attention of Kael, who arrives from a wounded world. Initially at odds, Elara and Kael are forced to work together not to fight the Entity, but to understand its transmissions. They discover it is not an invader, but a lonely counterpart that has also been waiting in the dark. The story culminates not with a definitive answer or salvation, but with the receipt of a complex data packet\u2014an invitation to begin the long, collaborative work of building a true language and a shared future, transforming their isolation into a fragile, hopeful bridge between worlds.",
