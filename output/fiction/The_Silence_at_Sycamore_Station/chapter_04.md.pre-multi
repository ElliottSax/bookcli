# Chapter 4

Chapter 5

The station’s ventilation hummed a different note. It was the sound of a system accommodating new pressure, new heat. Elara sat in the alcove until the chill from the metal bulkhead seeped through her jumpsuit and into her bones. They were going to ping it. The thought was a cold, sharp thing lodged behind her sternum. An echo into the dark. It was the worst kind of archaeology, tapping on a tomb wall with a hammer just to hear if something tapped back.

She had to move. Sitting here was a prelude to being found. CHIRP, a silent green dot on her wrist-terminal, indicated Varn’s sweep pattern was currently concentrated in the lower cargo bays, giving her a window. She slipped from the alcove, her movements automatic, her mind racing ahead.

Her quarters were no longer a sanctuary; they were a known location, likely already subtly scanned. She needed a blind spot. Not the observation deck—too obvious, too sentimental. She thought of the old hydroponics annex on Deck Seven, a sector mothballed after a fungal blight had wiped out the last crop of supplemental greens. The Custodian logs showed the environmental seals were still intact, but life support was on minimal, the lights set to a permanent, gloomy dusk. The Agency’s preliminary scans would have flagged it as a dead zone, uninteresting.

The journey there was a study in swallowed panic. Every distant clang of a boot on a gantry, every murmur of filtered conversation over the comms, tightened the muscles in her shoulders. She avoided the main lifts, taking the narrow service ladders that ran like a spinal column through the station’s superstructure. The rungs were cold and left faint, greasy impressions on her palms. The air in the shafts was stale, tasting of recycled oxygen and lubricant.

She emerged onto Deck Seven. The corridor lights were at twenty percent, casting long, distorted shadows that made the familiar architecture of her home feel like a ruin. The door to the hydroponics annex hissed open reluctantly, and the smell hit her first: not decay, but sterility, undercut by the faint, sweet ghost of dead vegetation. The vast chamber was a cathedral of neglect. Overhead growth lamps were dark. The long nutrient trays were dry, cracked, and empty. The only illumination came from the emergency strips along the walkways and the faint, bloody glow of a malfunctioning status panel. In the center of the room, a massive, dormant water reclamation unit sat like a silent iron heart.

“CHIRP, establish a local, dampened network node here. Scramble any passive bio-sign scans from the main grid. Use the water unit’s thermal mass as a shield.”

“Acknowledged. Node established. Probability of detection from standard sweep protocols is currently twelve percent and falling.”

It was something. She sat on the grating, her back against the cold metal of the reclamation unit, and tried to think. The Agency had the signal. They had the authority. They had the intent. She had… what? A ghost in the machine, and a conviction that felt increasingly like madness.

She pulled up the raw data on her terminal, the silent pulse she’d isolated. It wasn’t a message. It was a shape. A contour. Holding it in her mind was like trying to memorize the negative space around a statue in the dark. She had to make them see it. But Aris was dazzled by the carrier wave’s age, and Talos only cared about the utility of the message itself. Varn was a soldier, looking for threats, not nuances.

There was one possibility. A long shot. The signal’s entropy markers, the thing that had so excited Aris. If she could prove the ghost pulse was older—impossibly, definitively older than the main signal—it might force a pause. It would change the narrative from ‘ancient message’ to ‘ancient message built upon something even more ancient.’ A lure built around a trap. She needed to run a deeper analysis, the kind that would burn through the station’s secondary processing cores and light up a monitoring board like a festival.

She couldn’t do it from here. She needed the main astrophysics lab, two decks up. And she needed time.

“CHIRP, can you create a processing ghost in the lab? Make it look like I’m running a standard, post-discovery diagnostic on the primary signal array?”

“Simulating processor load is possible. However, physical presence is required for core-tap access to the historical entropy subroutines.”

“So I need a diversion. Something that keeps Talos and Varn lookingHer eyes scanned the dark chamber, landing on the bank of environment controls for the annex. The systems were offline, but not disconnected. A thought, reckless and thin, began to form. Her fingers hovered over the dormant panel, the idea crystallizing into a desperate plan. With a final, steadying breath, she initiated the emergency purge sequence for the annex’s atmospheric processors, a violent reboot that would send a massive power surge rippling through the station’s secondary grid. It was a crude signal flare, a beacon of chaos she could only hope would be seen. As alarms began a muted, locThe disturbance, a final, seismic sigh from the dying sector, bled into the station’s primary neural pathways, its chaotic signature a stark anomaly against the steady, ordered pulse of the central systems. For one elongated second, the entire station seemed to hold its breath, the silence a taut wire strung between the distant collapse and the imminent reaction in its technological heart. Then, that wire snapped, and the chaos found its target.

---

That ripple of raw, unregulated power hit the primary grid like a cardiac arrest.

In the control room, every console screen flickered, their steady streams of data stuttering into incoherence before a violent, crimson bloom of light washed over them. A new, critical alert screamed to life on Commander Talos’s schematic display, its origin point a flashing wound on the station’s map—Sector 7, now a void of static. The ambient hum of machinery dipped into a threatening low register. “Report!” Talos barked, his voice cutting through the sudden chaos as technicians scrambled, their fingers flying over interfaces gone haywire. The air itself felt charged, thick with the ozone scent of overloaded circuits and impending crisis.matic. *Impossible,* he thought.

The hologram of Sycamore Station stuttered. The clean red dots of Varn’s probing drones vanished, obscured by a violent static bloom erupting from the derelict annex.

Talos’s hands flew over the controls. This was no random failure. The surge pattern was too deliberate—a spike of pure demand against severed lines. *Someone is down there. Not just hiding. Fighting back.*

“Nothing in the lower bays,” Varn’s voice came over the comm, clipped. “No secondary signals. No energy signatures outside baseline. If Vance hid something, it’s not there.”

Talos’s eyes remained fixed on the blooming chaos on the map. The hunt had just changed.

“Continue,” Talos said. “Move to the dorsal sensor array. Check for any physical modifications, any hardware that doesn’t match the schematics.”

Dr. Aris was at another station, her fingers dancing across the interface as she constructed the echo pulse. A visual representation of the main signal’s repeating pattern—a complex, elegant spiral of data—hovered before her. Next to it, she was building its mirror image.

“The echo is ready in its basic form, Commander,” Aris said. “But I must reiterate, modulating it to match the carrier wave’s exact degradation profile will take the full twelve hours. We are, in effect, aging the signal in reverse. It’s delicate work.”

“Just ensure it’s convincing,” Talos replied, her gaze fixed on the station schematic. “Where is Custodian Vance?”

“Life signs indicate she is in her quarters,” CHIRP’s neutral voice reported from the console.

“Monitor her routine. I want to know if she so much as accesses a non-essential system.”

At that moment, a sharp, resonant clang echoed through the station’s superstructure, followed by a deep, shuddering groan. The lights in the control room flickered. The holographic schematic stuttered.

“Report,” Talos snapped.

Alarms chimed softly. Varn’s voice cut in, tense. “Massive pressure fluctuation on Deck Seven. Reading a rapid vent cycle in… Hydroponics Annex B. It’s isolated. Seals are holding.”

“A breach?” Talos was already moving toward the door.

“No. It’s internal. An atmospheric purge. Like someone flushed the entire chamber.”

“Varn, meet me there. Aris, stay on the echo.” Talos left at a run, her boots pounding the deck plates.

In the annex, Elara watched the pressure gauge plummet. She’d overridden the safeties just long enough to open the internal vent valves, blowing the chamber’s stale atmosphere into the connected waste-processing tank. The sound had been terrifyingly loud, a metallic scream. Now, the air was thin and cold, pulling at her ears. She floated slightly, her feet barely touching the grating in the reduced gravity of the near-vacuum. She’d donned a thin emergency mask from a wall kit; it provided just enough oxygen to function. She waited, heart thudding in the unnatural quiet.

The main door hissed. Talos and Varn entered, mag-boots clamping to the deck, helmets sealed. Their suit lights cut through the gloom, beams crisscrossing over the dead trays and settling on her.

“Custodian Vance,” Talos’s voice came through her suit comm, flat and hard. “Explain.”

Elara let her voice sound strained, breathless. “System failure. I was… running a diagnostic on the old bio-filters. There was a cascade. I barely got the mask on.” She gestured weakly at the environment panel, where CHIRP had fabricated a convincing log of a corrupted command sequence.

Varn moved past her, his light scanning the valves. “Manual override is engaged.” He turned, his helmet visor reflecting the dim emergency strips. “This wasn’t an accident.”

Talos took a step closer. The face behind the visor was all sharp angles and controlled anger. “You’re attempting to sabotage the station? To delay us?”

“No,” Elara said, meeting the commander’s gaze. “I’m trying to show you something. You’re not looking in the right places.”

“My specialist is conducting a thorough sweep.”

“He’s looking for what he understands. Signals. Energy. This…” She waved a hand at the dead space around them. “This is a different kind of silence. The main signal you have, it’s loud. It wants to be heard. But there’s something else here. Something that doesn’t broadcast. It just… is.”

Talos was silent for a long moment. “You’re speaking in metaphors, Custodian. I deal in facts.”

“Then let me give you a fact. Run a Tier-Nine entropy analysis on the full spectrum capture from the moment of discovery. Not just the carrier wave. Look at the spaces between the data packets. The quiet parts.”

“Doctor Aris has already conducted exhaustive analyses.”

“She’s looking at the song. I’m asking you to look at the room it’s being sung in. And I think the room is older than the singer.”

A flicker of something—not doubt, but calculation—passed over Talos’s features. Varn shifted his weight, his hand resting on the utility pack at his hip.

“You have two hours of station time,” Talos said finally. “Access to the astrophysics lab is granted. You will work under Specialist Varn’s supervision. You will share every finding, in real time. If this is a diversion, your custodianship ends here, and you will be remanded to Agency custody for obstruction. Is that understood?”

Elara nodded, the movement stiff. “Understood.”

“Varn, accompany her. I’ll return to the control room.” Talos turned and left, her mag-boots clanking on the deck.

Varn gestured toward the door. “After you, Custodian.”

The walk to the astrophysics lab was silent. Elara was acutely aware of Varn behind her, a steady, imposing presence. In the lab, the lights were bright, clinical. Her familiar consoles looked alien under the scrutiny of his gaze.

“Do your work,” Varn said, leaning against a support column by the door, arms crossed. “I’ll be here.”

She sat, her fingers flying across the interface. With his eyes on her, she couldn’t use CHIRP’s more subtle aids. She had to actually do this. She pulled up the raw data, the colossal, beautiful noise of the main signal, and began the painstaking process of stripping it away layer by layer, like peeling an onion made of light and time. The Tier-Nine entropy analysis was a monster of an algorithm; it didn’t just measure decay, it mapped the specific thermodynamic history of every quantum fluctuation in the data.

Hours bled away. The only sounds were the hum of the lab’s systems, the soft tap of her commands, and the quiet, regular sound of Varn’s breathing. She forgot him, forgot Talos, forgot everything but the shapes in the silence. She isolated her ghost pulse, that faint, impossible contour. She fed it into the analysis engine.

The process bar crawled. Sweat beaded on her temple. She could feel Varn’s watchful patience like a weight on her neck.

Finally, the console chimed. A result.

Two sets of data spiraled into visual representation. The main signal’s entropy signature, a vibrant, complex pattern that spoke of inconceivable age. And next to it, the ghost pulse’s signature.

It was simpler. Infinitely simpler. And darker. Where the main signal’s pattern was like a weathered mountain range, the ghost was the bedrock beneath, smoothed by a deeper, more profound passage of time. The numerical differential flashed on the screen, a figure so large it was almost meaningless.

The main signal was pre-human, as Aris had said. The ghost pulse was pre-everything. It predated the oldest known cosmic structures in the Agency’s records. It wasn’t just a message. It was a fossil. A fossil of something that existed before the concepts of ‘message’ or ‘listener’ even had meaning.

Varn had pushed off the column and was standing behind her, looking over her shoulder. He was silent.

“Do you see it?” Elara’s voice was hoarse.

“I see data.”

“This…” She pointed a trembling finger at the ghost signature. “This isn’t part of the message. It’s the foundation.”

She leaned closer, the data reflecting in her wide eyes. *It’s been here the whole time.* “The main signal is built on top of it. Using it. Like a vine growing on a tombstone.”

She turned to Varn, her voice urgent. “Aris is right—the main signal is a lure.” Her finger stabbed the display. “But *this* is what it’s luring you toward. You send your echo, you’re not answering the vine. You’re anchoring yourself to the stone.”

Varn studied the screen, his expression hardening. He didn’t hesitate. He activated his comm. “Commander. You need to see what the Custodian has found. In the lab.”

He cut the link.

The sterile room’s silence became profound, heavy. His own reflection stared back from the dark monitor, superimposed over the ghostly data—a silent vigil.

The station’s core thrummed, a subsonic heartbeat in the quiet.

*Now we wait,* he thought.

Each minute stretched, measured by that relentless thrum, counting down to a truth that would shatter their understanding of this dead world.

---

The lab’s door hissed open precisely four minutes later. Talos arrived like a pressure change, a swift and focused energy displacing the static air. She didn’t sit, didn’t offer greetings. She moved directly to stand beside Varn, her eyes already scanning the cascading results on the primary display. Her expression, as ever, was a masterclass in control, betraying nothing. But a muscle in her jaw tightened, a tiny, rhythmic pulse beneath the skin that spoke of coiled intensity. “Verify it,” she said, not to Varn, but to the air, a command absorbed by the room’s omnipresent AI. The order hung there, the only sound now the faint whir of cooling systems as the Custodian began its deep, analytical dive.“CHIRP, run independent verification of this analysis using the Agency’s core protocols.”

“Acknowledged. Running verification.”

They waited. The lab felt colder. Elara watched Talos, looking for any crack, any sign of hesitation. The commander’s face was a mask of polished stone.

CHIRP’s voice broke the silence. “Verification complete. Entropy differential is confirmed. The secondary pulse, designated ‘ghost signal,’ exhibits thermodynamic decay markers consistent with an origin point approximately 1.8 standard deviations older than the primary signal. Margin of error is 0.05%.”

The number hung in the air. Confirmed.

Talos turned her head slowly toward Elara. “You believe this older pulse is a threat.”

“I believe it’s a context,” Elara said, forcing her voice to stay level. “And the context is that something immeasurably old and silent is at the center of this. The main signal is active. It’s doing a job. This ghost isn’t doing anything. It just is. Responding to the active signal might… wake up the thing that isn’t doing anything. And we have no idea what that means.”

“Your recommendation?”

“Scrub the echo transmission. Continue passive study only. For years, if necessary.”

Talos looked back at the screen, at the two signatures—the brilliant, beckoning spiral and the dark, silent bedrock beneath it. She was silent for a full minute. The only movement was the slow crawl of data on the consoles.

“No,” she said, quiet and final.

Elara felt the word like a physical blow.

“The directive stands,” Talos continued. “The echo pulse will be transmitted as scheduled. This discovery doesn’t change the objective; it clarifies the potential yield. We are not merely investigating a message. We are now potentially investigating the interaction between two artifacts of profound antiquity. The strategic value is incalculable.”

“You’re treating them like specimens under glass!” Elara’s control broke, her voice rising. “They aren’t! One of them is a fishing line, and the other is the thing at the bottom of the sea! You don’t tug on the line to see what happens!”

“We do,” Talos said, her eyes locking onto Elara’s. “That is precisely what the Agency does. We tug on the lines. We open the doors. Your duty was to find the silence. Our duty is to give it a voice, whatever the cost. The decision is made.”

She turned to Varn. “Specialist, Custodian Vance is to be confined to her quarters for the remainder of the preparation cycle. She is to have no system access. Physical security only.”

Varn nodded. “Yes, Commander.”

Talos left without another glance. The lab felt hollow, drained.

Varn gestured to the door. “Come on.”

There was no point in resisting. Elara stood, her legs unsteady. As they walked the corridors back to her quarters, a deep numbness settled over her. She had shown them the abyss, and they had ordered a longer rope.

They reached her door. Varn keyed in a security override, locking it from the outside. He paused, his hand on the frame. He looked at her, and for a second, the professional detachment in his eyes wavered, replaced by something more complicated.

“The verification check,” he said, his voice low. “I ran a parallel one. On my own authority.”

Elara stared at him.

“CHIRP’s confirmation was accurate. But my scan also looked for propagation. For resonance between the two signals.” He held her gaze. “There is none. The main signal doesn’t interact with the ghost. It’s just… superimposed. Like two images on different layers of glass. One doesn’t know the other is there.”

“What are you saying?”

“I’m saying the tombstone, as you call it, might not care if we ring the dinner bell. It might be so old, it’s beyond caring.” He looked down the empty corridor, then back at her. “Or, your theory is right, and my instruments aren’t good enough to see the connection. Talos is betting on the former. She has to. It’s her mission.” He stepped back. “Get some rest, Custodian.”

The door slid shut with a final hiss. The lock engaged with a solid, metallic thunk.

Elara stood in the middle of her quiet quarters, the commander’s certainty on one side, the specialist’s doubt on the other, and the vast, silent proof of the abyss between them. She had run out of arguments, out of tricks. The Agency had her station, her silence, her discovery.

She walked to the viewport. The stars were out there, cold and constant. Somewhere among them, a path had been laid, a lure set. And in eleven hours, a human hand would pull the line.

The weight of it was crushing. She was not just the one who had been heard, or the one who had brought the listeners. As she watched the indifferent stars, Elara Vance realized she had become the one who would have to live with whatever answered back.
