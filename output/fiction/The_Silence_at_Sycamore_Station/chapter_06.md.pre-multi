# Chapter 6

Chapter 7

The green light made ghosts of everything. It pooled in the hollows of Varn’s face as he turned, weapon raised, turning the grim set of his mouth into something ghoulish. It gleamed on the slick surfaces of the dead consoles, making them look like still, black ponds. The air, robbed of its mechanical breath, grew thick and cold. Elara could feel the chill leaching through the soles of her boots from the deck plating below. The only sound was that dragging scrape from above, a metronome of wrongness, and the new, quicker pulse of the main signal—no longer a distant chime, but a pressure behind her eyes, a second, alien heartbeat thudding in her skull.

“Move,” Varn hissed, his voice a stripped wire. He didn’t look at her. His eyes were fixed on the open service hatch in the ceiling, a square of deeper black against the green-tinged shadows of the overhead gantry.

The scrape came again. Closer. It wasn’t a clean sound. It was layered—a primary grind of something unyielding on metal, undercut by a faint, wet susurration, like meat on stone.

Elara’s paralysis broke. This was her station. Her corpse. She knew its bones. She lunged for the main engineering console, her fingers flying over the dead touchscreen. “Backup cells,” she muttered, the words tasting of copper and fear. “They have to have a residual charge.”

“Elara, now,” Varn snapped. A shower of dust and flecks of ancient paint sifted down from the hatchway.

Her knuckle slammed against a physical override switch. A single console screen flickered, stuttered, and glowed with a weak, amber light. System schematics appeared, flashing red in three sectors: Lower Archives, Primary Life Support Junction B, and the Conduit Chase that ran vertically beside this very bay. The intrusion was moving down. Towards them.

“CHIRP,” she commanded, her voice steadier than she felt. “Emergency protocol Kappa. Isolate lower archives. Seal the blast doors on Chase Three.”

The AI’s response was a shattered mosaic of sound. “Affirm… ative. Door… mechanisms… compromised. Unknown… particulate… fouling… tracks.”

“What particulate?”

“Analysis… incomplete. Organic… and… mineral… composite. Attempting… seal.”

A heavy, hydraulic thump echoed from somewhere deep in the station’s spine, followed by a tortured shriek of metal forcing itself against a resistant mass. The sound died in a choked, final grind. The schematic showed the blast door in Chase Three stuck at forty percent closure.

“It’s trapped something in the door,” Varn interpreted, his weapon now tracking an imaginary path down the wall. “Or the door trapped part of it.”

Talos’s voice erupted from the comms panel, tinny and distorted through the emergency power. “—arn! Elara! Report! We are seeing catastrophic feedback in the main signal! The harmonic distortion is replicating! It’s building a… a structure!”

“We have a more immediate problem,” Varn barked into his wrist unit. “There’s a physical entity on the station. CHIRP’s calling it non-human. It’s in the walls.”

A beat of stunned silence. Then, Talos, his scientific fervor undimmed. “A manifestation? A coherent energy-matter transduction? You must get visual! Data is critical!”

“My critical data is its trajectory,” Varn shot back. “It’s heading for the archive. Why?”

Elara knew. The archive was cold storage, yes. But it was also the station’s neurological center. Conduits for data, for sensor feeds, for CHIRP’s auxiliary processing nodes all converged there. It was the one place, other than the engineering bay itself, where you could listen to the station’s whispers most clearly. Where you could maybe listen out.

“It’s not just here,” she said, the realization dawning with cold clarity. “It’s listening. The splinter. It’s an ear. The main signal… it’s unspooling, building something new from Talos’s distorted echo. This thing is here to gather more raw material.”

The scraping stopped.

The silence was worse. It was a held breath. The only sound was the frantic, almost eager pulse of the tombstone signal, now syncopated with the rush of blood in Elara’s ears.

Varn motioned sharply towards the bay’s main exit, a heavy pressure door leading to the central corridor. “We go. Now. To the archive.”

“It’s between us and there,” Elara argued, but she was already moving, grabbing a heavy torque wrench from a nearby rack. It was pitiful, but its weight was a comfort.

“It’s in the walls,” Varn corrected, his voice low. “The corridor might be clear. We need to see what it wants. We need to know what we invited in.”

They moved to the door. Varn hit the manual release. With a groan, it slid open a foot before jamming. The green emergency strips in the corridor beyond were dark. A deeper blackness waited there, smelling of ozone and something else—a dry, chalky scent, like a long-sealed tomb.

Varn squeezed through, his shoulder scraping the frame. Elara followed, the cold of the metal door kissing her back as she slipped into the corridor. The darkness was absolute, a physical presence. She could hear Varn’s measured breathing beside her, the faint creak of his gear. From far away, through layers of deck and insulation, she could hear Talos’s team arguing, their voices muffled and panicked.

Then, a new sound. Not from above. From ahead, around the curve of the corridor that led to the archive junction.

It was a wet, rhythmic tap.

Tap. Scrape. Tap.

Like something with too many joints was testing the floor.

Varn raised his sidearm, a solid-barrelled mag-pistol that seemed suddenly primitive. He clicked on a barrel-mounted light. The beam was a violent intrusion, carving a tunnel of stark white through the black. It swept over grimy walls, conduit labels, a fallen toolkit.

It settled on the junction ahead.

The archive blast door was there, a massive slab of reinforced titanium. And caught in its partially closed maw was a shape.

Elara’s mind refused to parse it at first. It was a mass of contradictions. It seemed to be both solid and insubstantial, its surface absorbing the light hungrily. It was roughly the size of a human torso, but its form was all wrong angles and shuddering, half-seen planes. It appeared to be made of the same substance as the station’s hull—dull, pitted metal—but it bled into shadows that moved independently of the light. And fused with that metal, growing from it like a hideous crystallization, were strands of something fibrous and darkly organic, pulsing gently. The chalky smell was stronger here, mixed with a sickly-sweet rot.

The thing was stuck, the lower third of its form pinched by the powerful door. But it wasn’t trapped. It was working. From its core, a shimmering, viscous substance—black and shot through with faint, gold sparks—was seeping out, flowing over the door’s mechanism like intelligent oil. Where it touched, metal hissed and dissolved into a fine, grey particulate that drifted to the floor. It was eating its way through.

Tap. A limb, a sharp protrusion of fused metal and bone-like filament, tapped against the floor, testing its purchase. Scrape. It dragged itself forward an inch, the door groaning in protest.

Varn’s light held steady. “Don’t move,” he whispered, though whether to her or the thing was unclear.

The thing, however, did move. It didn’t turn. It had no discernible front or back. But a section of its surface rippled. The dark, organic strands tightened, and a shape formed in the metal—a shallow, dish-like depression. It oriented towards them. Towards Varn’s light.

With a sound like tearing silk, the dish opened.

It wasn’t an eye. It was a pit. A void that reflected nothing. And from that void, the new, accelerated pulse of the main signal didn’t just sound. It projected. Elara felt the wave of pressure pass through her, a silent, ultrasonic shove that vibrated her teeth and made the bones in her hands ache. The beam of Varn’s light bent as it passed over the void-dish, distorting like heat haze.

“It’s emitting,” Varn breathed. “Not just listening. Broadcasting back.”

The thing’s tapping limb struck the floor harder, with a sharp crack. It began to pull itself forward again, the dissolving acid-flow renewing its efforts on the door. It was ignoring them. They were noise. The archive was the signal.

“We can’t let it in there,” Elara said. Her voice sounded small, swallowed by the hungry dark.

Varn took a step forward. “Hey!” he shouted, his voice booming in the confined space. “Over here!”

The thing paused. The void-dish rippled. The pulse intensified for a second, a focused burst that made Elara’s vision swim. A conduit box on the wall beside Varn sparked and went dead.

Then it resumed its work. They were irrelevant.

A cold fury washed over Elara, burning away the fear. This thing was in her home. It was chewing through her station’s history, its memory, to fuel some incomprehensible conversation with the void. It thought her beneath notice.

She hefted the torque wrench. “The emergency deluge,” she said, her eyes fixed on the ceiling above the junction. “For electrical fires. The manual valve is just past it.”

Varn understood instantly. “It’ll short everything. CHIRP, life support—”

“Is already on backups. And it’s eating the station, Varn. We need a different solvent.”

He gave a sharp, grim nod. “Cover me. Don’t get close.”

He moved, not towards the thing, but along the wall, keeping his light off it now, his steps silent. The thing’s tapping continued, a maddening, focused rhythm.

Elara took a step forward herself, raising the wrench. She felt foolish, a child threatening a storm with a stick. “Hey!” she yelled, her own voice surprising her. She slammed the wrench against a pipe running along the wall.

CLANG.

The sound was a physical shock in the silent corridor.

The thing shuddered. The void-dish swiveled, a seamless flow of wrong geometry, and fixed on her. The pressure wave hit her like a wall of dense water. She staggered back, her ears popping, a sharp pain needling behind her eyes. She saw images, fleeting and chaotic—not her own memories. A vast, geometric lattice of light against an endless black. A sensation of profound, waiting silence. And cutting through it, a jagged, screaming line of distortion—Talos’s imperfect echo, a beautiful scar.

It was showing her what it heard. What it valued.

Varn was at the deluge valve, a bright red wheel behind a clear cover. He smashed the cover with the butt of his pistol.

The thing’s tapping became frantic. It sensed the change in priority. The dish remained on Elara, but a new limb, sharp and glistening with that black-gold fluid, extruded from its mass and lashed out towards Varn, not touching him, but striking the wall beside him. The metal screamed as it dissolved, a foot-long section of conduit and plating vanishing into slurry.

Varn grabbed the wheel and heaved.

A klaxon whooped once, a dying animal’s cry. Then, with a great, shuddering sigh from the station’s bowels, a torrent of chemical foam erupted from the ceiling nozzles around the archive junction.

It was cold, dense, and designed to smother plasma fires. It fell in a thick, sudsy cascade, blanketing the junction, the door, and the thing.

The effect was immediate. The thing recoiled, not in pain, but in what seemed like profound confusion. The void-dish snapped shut, the surface smoothing over. The black-gold acid seemed to react violently with the foam, sizzling and solidifying into a brittle, glassy crust. The thing’s movements became jerky, labored. It was being insulated, deafened, blinded.

Varn was already moving back, grabbing Elara’s arm. “It won’t hold it! Run!”

They turned and fled back down the corridor towards engineering. Behind them, they heard a new sound—a high, thin vibration, like a wire being drawn to breaking point. It was the thing, emitting a frequency the foam couldn’t dampen. Sections of the chemical blanket began to vibrate, then shatter.

They burst back into the green gloom of the engineering bay. The single console still glowed.

“We need to trap it,” Elara gasped, leaning on the dead mainframe. “Seal it in the chase. We can flood the entire section with inert gas from the cargo airlocks. Suffocate whatever… biological component that is.”

Varn was at the console, calling up systems. “CHIRP, can you reroute auxiliary life support control to this terminal?”

“Rerouting…,” the AI’s voice crackled. “Warning. The entity is… adapting. It is incorporating the deluge chemicals into its structure.”

On the schematic, they saw it. The blob representing the splinter was moving again, slower, but with purpose. It was no longer trying to force the archive door. It was moving back up Chase Three, towards the engineering bay’s upper level. Towards them.

“It’s learned,” Varn said, his face grim. “We’re not noise anymore. We’re interference.”

A heavy thud resonated from the ceiling gantry above them. Dust rained down. Then another. It was jumping, or falling, from one level to the next, coming down the hard way.

Elara looked at the service hatch. It was still open. A black square.

“We need to close that,” she said.

Varn followed her gaze. “You’d have to go up there. Into the chase.”

Another thud, closer. The scraping began again, right above them now. A slow, deliberate drag across the metal mesh of the gantry floor.

“I know the access points,” she said, the words tumbling out. “There’s a manual hatch closure on the chase wall, three meters in. I can seal it from the inside, drop back through the secondary hatch in the machine shop.”

“It’s up there now, Elara.”

“And it will be down here in a minute if I don’t!” she shot back, her fear sharpening into a razor-edge of resolve. This was her station. She would fix its wounds.

Before he could argue, she was moving. She slung the wrench across her back and climbed onto a console, reaching for the lip of the hatch. Varn cursed, but moved to help, boosting her up. Her hands found the cold edge, and she pulled herself into the vertical tunnel of Chase Three.

It was narrower than she remembered, a claustrophobic shaft of darkness pierced only by the faint green glow from below. Service rungs were set into one wall. Conduits and fiber-optic bundles, now dead, lined the others. The air was stale and carried that same chalky-sweet smell, now overpowering. The scraping was deafening here, just around a gentle curve in the chase ahead.

She couldn’t see it. But she could hear it breathing.

It wasn’t a lung-breath. It was a hydraulic sigh, a release of pressure, accompanied by that faint, wet rustle.

Elara froze, clinging to the rungs. Her heart was a frantic animal in her chest. The manual hatch control was a small, red lever just around that curve. She had to go past it.

Scrape. Tap.

It was moving again. Away from her. Towards the spot where the chase opened onto the gantry above the engineering bay. It was going to drop down.

She moved, hand over hand, silent as the void. The green light from below faded. The darkness became total, a velvet pressure against her eyes. She felt her way, each rung a cold reassurance. The smell grew stronger. It was the smell of the thing, of the void, of the tombstone signal given form.

Her outstretched hand brushed against something.

It was not metal. It was warm. And it yielded slightly, like tough rubber over a complex frame. A trailing edge. A limb.

She snatched her hand back, a scream locked in her throat.

The scraping stopped.

The hydraulic sigh came again, right beside her ear. The thing had stopped. It knew.

In the absolute black, she felt a displacement of air. Something was reorienting itself. She imagined the void-dish opening, drinking in the sound of her terror, the heat of her body.

She didn’t think. She swung the wrench from her back and, with all her strength, slammed it into the space where the sigh had come from.

It connected with a sickening, wet crunch, like stepping on a frozen puddle. A shock traveled up her arms. The thing made no sound of pain, but a vibration erupted from it—the high, wire-tight frequency. It struck her full in the face. Her nose bled instantly, a warm trickle. Lights exploded behind her eyes.

But she had bought a second.

She lunged forward, blind, her hands slapping against the smooth wall. They found the lever. She threw her weight against it.

With a solid clunk, a heavy internal hatch slid out from the wall, severing the chase. It cut off the green light from below entirely. She was now in a sealed, pitch-black tube with the thing.

And the thing was between her and the engineering bay.

Its vibration changed pitch, dropping into a low, resonant hum that made her ribs ache. She heard the wet, tearing sound of its form shifting. It was coming for her, in the dark.

Elara scrambled backwards, away from it, up the rungs. The secondary hatch to the machine shop had to be close. Her hands flailed above her, searching.

The hum grew louder. The air grew thick, charged. She could feel a presence drawing closer, a chill that had nothing to do with temperature.

Her fingers found the recessed latch of the hatch. She clawed at it, sobbing with effort. It gave. She pushed upward, and a dim, grey light from the machine shop’s emergency strips flooded in.

She hauled herself out, rolling onto the cold floor, and kicked the hatch shut with her boot. She heard the thing’s form thud against the metal below, once, twice. Then silence.

She lay there, gasping, the taste of blood and chemical foam in her mouth. She had trapped it. For now.

Varn’s voice came through her wrist unit, strained. “Elara? Status!”

“It’s sealed in the chase,” she rasped. “Flood it. Now.”

She heard his muffled commands, the hiss of systems engaging. Down below, in the walls of her station, inert nitrogen would be flooding the conduit chase, stealing all breath, freezing all process.

A moment later, Talos’s voice cut in, shrill with a new terror. “The signal! It’s changed again! In response to the… the conflict! It’s building the distortion into its core pattern! It’s not just answering anymore. It’s learning. It’s learning from the splinter’s experience!”

Elara pushed herself to her feet, looking down at the closed hatch. The silence from below was absolute.

They hadn’t stopped it. They had given it a new lesson. They had taught it about barriers, about resistance, about pain.

And somewhere in the infinite dark, the main signal was weaving that lesson into its reply.
