Chapter 4: The Whisper from the Void

The bleeding place wasn't a location. It was a condition.

Elara stood at its edge, her boots sinking into something that was neither soil nor flesh, but a spongy, porous mess that wept a clear, sticky fluid. The air tasted of ozone and spoiled honey. The landscape before her didn't so much change as unfold. The forest of her childhood—the pines that had once scraped the sky—now bent in impossible arcs, their trunks spiraling like melted candy. Their needles were gone, replaced by clusters of tiny, black crystals that chimed in a wind that wasn't there. The sky above was a bruise, purple and green and depthless, streaked with veins of pulsing, iridescent light that beat in time with a heartbeat she felt in her molars.

This was where it had begun. Where the townsfolk, their eyes glazed with a promise she could no longer remember, had gathered under the guidance of the thing inside her. The memory was a black hole in her mind, ringed by a screaming disk of impressions: chanting that vibrated in the marrow, a light that cast no shadows, and a final, silent detonation that hadn't destroyed matter, but its meaning.

Come. The thought bloomed in her skull, warm and insistent as a tumor. It wasn't her voice. It was the sound of a glacier calving, of continental plates grinding, given a terrible, intimate grammar. The aperture is thin here. You can see.

"See what?" Elara whispered. Her own voice was a frail, rusted thing. Her throat was raw. She hadn't spoken to another human in... time had lost its shape. It could have been days or weeks since she woke in the husk of her home.

The feast. The purpose.

A pressure built behind her eyes. The unfolded forest shimmered, and for a moment she didn't see the twisted trees. She saw strands. Billions of them, luminous and fine as spider-silk, stretching into the impossible distances of the bruise-colored sky. They vibrated with colors that had no name, each strand thrumming with a symphony of lives, decisions, births, and deaths. A tapestry of reality. And she saw, with a clarity that liquefied her knees, that many of these strands were... severed. Their brilliant light ended in ragged, gnawed-off stumps. From these stumps, a slow, black seepage dripped, a cosmic sap that gathered in a vast, silent pool of nothingness at the base of all things.

And in the center of that pool, a shape. Not a body, not a form, but a function. A mouth that was also a womb, a consumption that was also a creation. It was the entity. It was feeding on the timelines, swallowing worlds not of matter, but of possibility.

You are the bridge, the voice within purred. The vessel. Your resonance... unique. You make the unreal, real. You give it a door.

Elara vomited, a thin, bitter bile that steamed on the weeping ground. She was a key. A can opener for the cosmos. Her hands, slick with cold sweat, clenched into fists. The despair was total, a weight that promised to compress her.
