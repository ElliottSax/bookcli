Chapter 3: The First Fracture

The compulsion was a physical thing.

It lived in the marrow of Elara’s bones, a low-frequency hum that vibrated her teeth. It was a tug behind her navel, insistent and undeniable, pulling her east, away from the corpse of Harlow’s Rest. The thing inside her didn’t speak in words, not yet. It spoke in pressures, in urges, in sudden, vivid images that flashed behind her eyes like lightning scarring a retina: a black stone, veined with silver; a circle of figures, their mouths open in a silent scream; a tear in the fabric of everything, bleeding a cold, indigo light.

She walked. There was no preparing, no gathering supplies. The idea of ‘supplies’ was a joke. What food was left in the shattered pantry had become a pulsating, gelatinous mass that smelled of cloves and decay. Water from the tap ran in thick, amber droplets that crawled up the sides of the glass. Time, in Harlow’s Rest, was just unspooled yarn, tangled and knotted.

Leaving the town’s edge—marked only by the sudden stop of the warped, impossible houses—felt like pushing through a membrane of cold syrup. The air popped, and the world outside was both familiar and profoundly wrong.

The road to the old Miller farm, where the compulsion pulled her, used to be a twenty-minute drive. Now, it was a journey through a landscape of temporal eddies. She would take ten steps and watch the sun arc frantically across the sky, noon to dusk to dawn in a dizzying blink, the shadows of the pines whipping around her like the hands of a mad clock. Then, she’d stumble into a pocket of absolute stillness, where the air was thick and unmoving, and a single drop of rain hung, glittering and monstrous, an inch from her cheek for what felt like hours. Distances lied. A stand of birch trees would seem a mile away, then she’d blink and be walking among them, their papery bark whispering secrets in a language of rustling paper and splintering wood.

Her body was no longer entirely her own. She felt it as a clumsy, biological vehicle. The entity’s presence was a second nervous system, a web of alien sensation laid over her own. Sometimes, she’d look at her hand and see, for a fractured second, not flesh and bone, but a lattice of shimmering energy, a blueprint of a form she was never meant to inhabit.

She was crossing what had been a meadow when she saw the first Echo.

It was Mrs. Althea, the postmaster. Or a memory of her, sculpted from frayed light and lingering sound. She was semi-transparent, a mirage made of grief. She was on her knees, repeating a loop of action with the precision of a broken record. Elara watched, frozen, as the phantom Mrs. Althea reached out for something only she could see, her face crumpling in an agony so profound it was a physical force. A silent wail tore from her lips. Then she would clutch her chest, her form flickering, and the sequence would start over. Reach. Agony. Wail. Clutch. Again. The loop took
