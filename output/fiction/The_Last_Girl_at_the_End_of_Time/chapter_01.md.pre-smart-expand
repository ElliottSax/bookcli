Chapter 1: The Silence of Lark's Hollow

The first thing she knew was the taste of copper and burnt sugar, thick on her tongue. The second was the cold. It wasn’t the clean chill of a Lark’s Hollow dawn; this was a deep, marrow-sapping cold that seemed to seep up from the ground itself, through the cobblestones and into the meat of her.

Elara opened her eyes.

The sky was wrong.

It hung above her, a vast, unblinking expanse of static purple, the color of a week-old bruise. No clouds drifted. No sun bled through. It was a flat, dead canvas, stretching to a horizon that seemed both too close and impossibly far. She lay on her back in the town square, the familiar, moss-edged stones pressing into her spine. But the scent of pine and woodsmoke was gone, replaced by an ozone tang, metallic and sharp, undercut by a sweet, cloying rot.

She pushed herself up, her joints protesting with a stiffness that felt earned over years, not hours. Her head throbbed, a dull, insistent drumbeat behind her eyes. Memory was a shattered pane of glass—she could see glittering fragments, but none fit together. There had been bells. Chanting, a low drone that vibrated in the teeth. There had been… light. A light that wasn’t light, a color that hurt to think about.

The square was empty.

No. Not empty.

She turned her head, and the world tilted—not with dizziness, but with a gut-wrenching wrongness. The buildings of Lark’s Hollow stood, but they stood wrong. Old Man Henderson’s apothecary leaned at an angle that defied gravity, its timber frame bent like taffy, the windows stretched into long, thin screams of glass. The town hall’s clock tower didn’t spiral; it corkscrewed, its stone twisting upon itself in a silent, petrified agony. The geometry was a lie. Corners met where they shouldn’t, creating angles that strained her vision, that made her want to look away before her mind could parse them. The very air seemed to shimmer faintly around these impossible junctures, a heat-haze of unreality.

And among this architectural blasphemy, the people.

They were still there. All of them. Mayor Green, Mrs. Pembleton from the bakery, the Miller twins, Old Man Henderson himself. They were arranged in a wide, loose circle around the dry stone fountain where she now sat. They were frozen, not in ice, but in a final, terrible moment.

Elara’s breath hitched, a ragged sound in the profound silence. She crawled to her feet, her legs trembling.

Mayor Green stood closest, his face upturned to the bruised sky. His mouth was open in what should have been a shout, but his features were… elongated. His jaw had unhinged, stretching his face into a taut mask, his eyes pulled into narrow, weeping slits. His fingers, splayed at his sides, had fused together, the skin between them webbed and hardened into dark, chitinous fins. He looked less like a man and more like a deep-sea creature hauled gasping into an alien atmosphere.
