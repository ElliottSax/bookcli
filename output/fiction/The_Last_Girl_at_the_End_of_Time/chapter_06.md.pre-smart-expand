Chapter 6: The Drowning City

The fishhook was buried deep in the meat of her mind. It pulled, and Elara walked, a marionette with strings woven through her synapses. The Stillbeat Heart was a cold, crystalline knot of captured time, a leaden weight in her pack. It didn’t beat, not in any way she could hear, but she felt its pulse in her teeth—a sub-audible thrum that matched the wrongness in the air.

For three days, the landscape had been softening. The jagged, bleeding rocks of the ritual site gave way to hills that slumped like tired flesh, then to a plain of grey, spongy matter that sighed under her boots. The sky, that perpetual bruise, hung lower here, pressing down with a humid, expectant weight. And then the ground just stopped.

She stood at the edge of a vast, circular basin. Below, drowned, was a city. But it wasn’t drowned in water.

The medium was viscous, translucent, the colour of weak tea. And it moved. Not with waves, but with a deep, rhythmic inhale and exhale, making the spires and domes below swell and recede as if seen through a colossal, breathing lens. The city was all elegant, spiralling architecture, now blurred and softened by its amniotic tomb. A low, wet sound echoed up the basin walls: the city breathing. In… and out…

The hook in her mind yanked, pointing straight down.

There was a path—a spiralling, organic-looking ramp of the same spongy stone, leading into the fluid. Her body moved before her fear could take shape. The substance lapped at her boots as she descended, warm and thicker than air, thinner than water. She took one last gasping breath of the stale world-air and stepped in.

It wasn’t wet. It was slick. It pushed back, but she could move, could breathe it in shuddering, reluctant gulps. It tasted of ozone and old copper, and it filled her lungs with a disturbing ease. The pressure was immense, a constant, gentle squeeze on every inch of her. The breath of the city was a current, pulling her one way, then the other, in time with its slow, pulmonary rhythm.

And she could see. Too much.

The change had been creeping in since she’d taken the Heart. Now, submerged, it bloomed into full, terrifying flower. Her eyes stung, then adjusted. The medium wasn’t translucent; it was transparent to colours she’d never seen. She saw the heat-ghosts of ancient energy conduits threading the buildings, a fading neon violet. She saw slow, drifting motes of microscopic life—or something like it—glowing a sickly green as they fed on decay. She saw the psychic residue of the city’s last moments: screams etched into the air as faint, rippling scarlets, frozen in the eternal breath.

It was a synesthetic nightmare. She didn’t just see the violet glow; she heard it as a high, teeth-aching whine. The green motes smelled of rotting honey. The world was too loud, too bright, too pungent. She stumbled, disoriented, her human senses drowning in the data flood.
