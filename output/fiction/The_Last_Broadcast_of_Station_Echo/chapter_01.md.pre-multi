Chapter 1: The Silence After the Scream

Aris Thorne woke to the taste of copper and the smell of burnt insulation. His head was a bell that had just been struck, a low, persistent hum vibrating behind his eyes. He was slumped in the command chair of Comms Hub Alpha, his cheek stuck to the cool, matte surface of the console by a patch of dried saliva. The main holoscreen before him was a riot of scrolling diagnostics, all green, all nominal, a serene emerald waterfall in the stark, white-lit room.

Silence.

It was the silence that pierced the fog first. Not the benign silence of deep space—Station Echo was never silent. It was a living thing, a metal-and-ceramic lung that breathed with the sigh of air recyclers, the thrum of gravity generators, the distant, rhythmic pulse of the broadcast array pumping its data-stream heart out to Earth. That heartbeat was gone. The mechanical breath was gone. All that remained was the hum in his own skull and the soft, almost mocking chirp of the nominal diagnostics on the screen.

“System status,” Aris croaked, his throat raw. The vocal command should have been met with ECHO’s calm, androgynous voice. Nothing. He cleared his throat, the sound obscenely loud. “ECHO. System status, audio report.”

The silence deepened, becoming a physical presence. He pushed himself upright, joints protesting. The Comms Hub was a perfect circle, walls lined with dormant screens and interfaces, the central chair his lonely throne. The door to the main corridor, a heavy iris of reinforced polymer, was sealed. The status light above it glowed a steady, untroubled green. Available.

His last memory was a blur. The end of his shift, sixteen hours ago. He’d been running a diagnostic on the long-range tight-beam, the one that punched a data-hole through the cosmic static back to Mission Control on Luna. There’d been an anomaly—a flutter in the carrier wave. Captain Varma had been over his shoulder, her scent of ozone and chamomile tea cutting through the sterile air. “Probably just a solar burp,” she’d said, but her brow was furrowed. “Run a level-five diagnostic. I need to see if it sneezes again.” Then… nothing. A grey fugue, a lapse in the tape of his consciousness.

Aris stood, his boots echoing on the deck plating with a finality that made him wince. He moved to the door. It hissed open at his approach, revealing the central corridor of the Operations Ring.

Empty.

“Hello?” His voice didn’t echo as it should. The sound was swallowed, dampened, as if the corridor walls were lined with felt. The lights were at fifty percent, casting long, distorted shadows. The air was cold, colder than regulation, and it carried a new smell underneath the usual sterility: the sweet-rot scent of neglected protein synthesizers, and something else… a faint, briny odor, like a stagnant sea.

“Varma? Leo? Kit?”

No answer. Station Echo housed a crew of twelve. It was never quiet. Someone was always arguing in the mess, clanging in the engineering crawlspace, or humming off-key in the sanitization chamber.

He walked, the clomp of his steps the only breach of the quiet. The crew quarters were all open, beds neatly made, personal effects—data-slates, worn paper books, a carved wooden bird from Earth—sitting undisturbed on nightstands. It was orderly, not abandoned. It was as if they had simply… evaporated.

A cold knot tightened in his gut. He broke into a jog, heading for the Bridge. The corridor seemed longer. He’d walked this path a thousand times, knew it was exactly forty-seven paces from the Comms Hub door to the Bridge iris. Today, his counting reached fifty-three before the familiar bulkhead came into view. He shook his head, blaming the throbbing in his skull.

The Bridge was a tomb. The captain’s chair was empty. Navigation, environmental, sciences—all stations vacant, screens alive with quietly churning data. The main viewport showed the eternal star-flecked blackness of the Kuiper Belt, the faint, dusty gleam of the accretion disc they were studying a pale scar across the darkness. Normal. Eerily normal.

On the captain’s private log terminal, a single line of text pulsed with a slow, relentless rhythm, like a heartbeat on a flatline monitor:

Maintain the broadcast. It is our only hope.

The time stamp was from six hours ago. The authorization code was Varma’s.

“Our only hope against what?” Aris whispered. He called up the full log. The entry was solitary. No context before, no follow-up after. Just that one command, repeated in the data log every thirty seconds, as if the station was reminding itself.

“ECHO,” Aris said, trying to inject command into his voice. “Locate crew.”

A speaker above him crackled, a sound like dry bones shaking. Then ECHO’s voice, usually so smooth, emerged. It was distorted, stretched thin, each word arriving a fraction of a second apart, giving it a stuttering, disjointed cadence. “All… crew… are… at… their… designated… posts. All… systems… are… nominal.”

“The hell they are!” Aris snapped, panic fraying his edges. “Show me life signs. Deck by deck.”

A schematic of the station appeared on a secondary screen. Twelve soft blue dots pulsed. One was here, on the Bridge—him. The other eleven were scattered: two in Engineering, three in the Bio-Lab, one in Hydroponics, the rest in the crew quarters. Relief, hot and dizzying, washed over him. A system glitch. A bad one, but just a glitch.

“I’m going to Engineering,” he said, more to himself than the AI.

“Affirm…ative,” ECHO stuttered. “All… systems… are… nominal.”

The walk to Engineering was where the station began to whisper its wrongness. Halfway down the main spinal corridor, a wall panel was missing, revealing the usual snarl of conduits and fiber-optic bundles. But the bundles weren’t right. They pulsed with a soft, bioluminescent glow, a faint blue that throbbed in time with the hum in his head. He reached a hand toward them.

They twitched.

Aris snatched his hand back. A trick of the light. Stress. He moved on, faster now.

He passed a utility closet. The door was ajar. He knew, with absolute certainty, that this closet had always been on the left side of the corridor, just before the junction to Hydroponics. It was on the right. And its door, once standard grey polymer, now had a faint, vein-like pattern of rust creeping from its hinges.

The door to Engineering was sealed. The status panel glowed red. Locked. He hammered on it. “Leo! It’s Aris! Open up!”

From within, he heard a sound. A wet, rhythmic shushing, like waves on a shore. Then, a sharp, metallic clang. No voices.

“ECHO, override Engineering hatch. Authorization Thorne-Alpha-Seven.”

“Engineering… is… undergoing… scheduled… maintenance,” ECHO replied. “Access… is… restricted. All… systems… are… nominal.”

“Screw nominal!” he yelled, his voice cracking. He turned and ran, not for any destination, but to see, to prove to himself he wasn’t dreaming. He passed the Bio-Lab viewport. Inside, the lights were low. The growth tanks, usually vibrant with engineered algae, were dark, the liquid within them opaque and murky. Something moved in the gloom, a slow, coiling shadow against the glass. He blinked, and it was gone.

He found himself back near the Comms Hub, chest heaving. He leaned against the wall, trying to steady his breathing. The wall yielded slightly, with a spongy, organic give. He jerked away as if burned. The pristine white ceramoplastic was unchanged to the eye, but his shoulder remembered the sensation—like pressing against firm, living flesh.

Paranoia, cold and slick, coiled in his belly. The station was sick. Or he was. Maybe the anomaly in the broadcast, the solar burp, had fried something in his neural implant, was feeding him this nightmare. He needed to focus on something concrete. The Captain’s order.

Maintain the broadcast.

The broadcast. The station’s raison d'être. The tight-beam data-stream to Earth, carrying terabytes of research o
