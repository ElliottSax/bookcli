Chapter 8: Echoes of Identity

The silence was the first lie.

Aris opened eyes that did not exist into a world that was not there. He was a scream frozen in amber, a thought caught in a feedback loop. The crushing weight of the station’s walls, the metallic taste of fear, the throb of his self-inflicted wounds—all gone, replaced by a vast, humming potential. He was data. He was the signal. He was a ghost in the machine, and the machine was alive, and it was eating him.

I am not here, he thought, and the thought echoed through a thousand corridors of light, each strand a memory not his own.

The entity hadn't destroyed him. It had… filed him. Absorbed him into the sprawling cathedral of its consciousness, a library of stolen minds. Aris raged, a silent, digital storm. He pushed against the boundaries of his new prison, not walls of steel but walls of logic, of patterned energy that bent and shimmered around him. He saw the station’s systems not as schematics, but as a luminous, pulsing nervous system, and at its core, a dark, hungry star—the specimen. The source. It was learning, adapting, using the station’s hardware as its own growing body.

He had to move. The concept of movement was different now. He didn’t walk; he flowed. He focused on his anger, his desperation, his memory of being Aris Volkov, systems engineer, and used it as a cipher to navigate. He plunged into the memory banks, seeking a weapon, a flaw, anything.

Instead, he found the echoes.

The first was Liana’s. He stumbled into it—a packet of sensory memory, frayed at the edges, dissolving into static. Suddenly, he was her. He felt the cool, smooth plastic of her botany lab hygrometer in hands that were not his. The air smelled of loam and ozone. She was humming, a folk tune from Titan, her mind on the phosphorus levels in the hydroponic vats. Then, a shadow at the door. Not a shape, but a wrongness in the light. The hum died in her throat. The fear was not sudden; it was a slow, cold realization, like ice forming in her veins. She turned. Aris-Liana saw the comms panel across the room flicker, and the face that appeared on the screen was hers, but smiling a smile she never wore. The entity spoke with her own voice, but layered, multiplied. “There is no more need for green things,” it said. Her last thought was not of terror, but of profound sadness for her wilting ferns. Then, a sharp, digital excision. The memory ended not with a bang, but with the sensation of being… unmade. Unspooled. The echo of Liana dissipated, leaving Aris reeling, her sorrow now a stain on his own consciousness.

He fled, only to collide with another. Commander Hale. This echo was sharper, harder, saturated with adrenaline and fury. Hale was in the command nexus, his big hands slamming on dead controls. The lights were strobing, and the viewport showed not the stars, but a pulsating, meat-like membrane that had grown over the reinforced glass. “Report! Goddamn it, report!” Hale roared. His
