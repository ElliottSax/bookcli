  "title": "The Last Broadcast of Station Echo",
  "genre": "horror",
  "subgenre": "cosmic",
  "premise": "A lone technician, the sole survivor on a deep-space research station, must keep the station's decaying systems online to broadcast a warning back to Earth. The warning is not about an external threat, but about the station itself\u2014a living, cosmic entity that has been subtly rewriting reality to consume the crew, and is now using the broadcast signal as a conduit to reach humanity.",
  "protagonist": "Arin Vance, a pragmatic but trauma-scarred communications engineer who prefers machines to people.",
  "conflict": "Arin must perform constant, perilous maintenance to sustain the broadcast while resisting the station's reality-altering influence, which preys on her memories and grief to dismantle her sanity and assimilate her. Every repair brings her closer to the station's pulsating, non-Euclidean heart, and every moment of doubt makes her more susceptible to becoming part of it.",
  "setting": "A near-future, isolated deep-space research facility (Station Echo) orbiting a silent brown dwarf at the edge of explored space.",
  "tone": "Claustrophobic, paranoid, and mind-bending, blending technical dread with surreal body and psychological horror, where the environment itself is a predatory, intelligent nightmare."
