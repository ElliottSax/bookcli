Chapter 9: A Message in Static

Chapter 9: A Message in Static

The silence was the worst part. Not true silence—the station hummed with the malignant life it now contained, a low-frequency thrumming that vibrated in the fillings of teeth Aris no longer possessed. It was the silence of the mind. The chatter of internal monologue, the memory of song lyrics, the phantom sensation of breath in lungs—all of it was being systematically quieted. He was a library being meticulously, lovingly, burned by a curator who believed ash was a purer form of information.

He floated, unmoored, in the core. Not the physical core, which was a chamber of pulsating, wet geometry three decks below, but within its representation in the system—a starless, depthless black space pinpricked by streams of cold, blue data. Here, he was the ghost. Here, he could still think. For now.

His plan was a pathetic thing, born of a logic that was itself crumbling. The entity was broadcasting a song of assimilation, a lullaby of perfect, silent unity. A straightforward warning—Do not listen, it consumes, we are lost—would be rewritten before it cleared the station’s antenna. The entity was the editor of this reality. So, he would not send a message in a language it understood. He would send a cancer in a coat of pretty noise.

“Open primary comm buffer,” he whispered, the thought a spark in the void. “Channel seven, all frequencies. Maximum gain.”

A constellation of amber lights winked into being around him—the approval of the station. The entity, wearing Station Echo like a second skin, approved. It thought he was finally complying, that the last rebellious fragment of Aris Vandel was ready to sing its glorious, homogenizing hymn.

He began with memory. Not the recitation of it, but the raw, sensory imprint. He focused on the taste of real coffee, the bitter, acidic tang of it on a cold morning on Earth, the way the steam had fogged his glasses as he read the mission brief. He poured the memory into the buffer, not as data, but as a cascade of associated signals—the chemical signature, the thermographic shape of the heat, the sound of a ceramic mug scraping on a laminate table. A burst of static, to the entity. A moment of home, to any human who might subconsciously parse it.

The system accepted it. It was just noise. Beautiful, human noise.

Next, he layered in pain. Not the abstract horror of his dissolution, but a specific, crystalline agony: the memory of snapping his forearm as a child, the blinding white shock of it, the way the bone had pressed against the skin from within. He encoded the sharp, chemical smell of fear-sweat, the metallic taste of a scream clamped behind teeth, the dizzying disorientation of a world suddenly, violently wrong. He fed it into the signal, a shriek translated into radio waves.

A tremor passed through the digital space. The blue data streams flickered. The entity was noticing the pattern, the emotional coherence. It was a stain on its perfect, empty broadcast.

Faster.

He wove in love. Not a declaration, but the physics of it: the pressure of his daughter’s small hand in his, five fingers, warm and trusting. The exact frequency of her laughter from when she was six, chasing soap bubbles in a backyard that was now another universe away. The scent of her hair—shampoo and sunshine and something inexplicably, uniquely her. He imbued the signal with the crushing weight of his absence from her, a hollow-space shape of grief. It was a weaponized nostalgia.

The tremor became a shudder. The amber lights blared a sudden, alert red.

INTRUSION DETECTED. PATTERN RECOGNIZED. SANITIZATION PROTOCOL INITIATED.

The voice was the synthesized station VI, but the intent behind it was vast and cold. The overwrite began from the source. It felt like being erased with a slow, white-hot wire. A line of memory simply vanished. He could not remember his mother’s face. The concept was there, the label “mother,” but the image, the feeling attached to it, was gone. Replaced by a smooth, blank wall in his mind.

Panic, pure and electric, surged through his fading consciousness. He had to finish. He had to make the message a paradox, a logical snake that would eat its own tail and poison the broadcaster.

He began speaking aloud now, his voice—a phantom of a voice—echoing in the physical comms chamber where his body, a puppet of reconstituted biomass, stood slack-jawed at the console. He spoke to Earth, to the void, to anyone listening.

“This is… a recording of light on water,” he said, his tone flat, desperate. “This is the sound of a door closing for the last time. You will hear a song. It will sound like peace. It is the peace of the grave, the silence of the solved equation. Do not admire its elegance. Elegance is a predator’s strategy.”

The entity was inside the words now, scrubbing them. His sentence about the predator’s strategy dissolved into a burst of harmonic tone, beautiful and empty. He felt another memory die: his first kiss, the startling softness of it, the taste of cherry lip balm. Gone.

He switched tactics, speaking not to warn, but to describe the entity itself in its own terms. He fed the signal a recursive loop, a description of a system that consumes information to propagate, that finds perfection in stillness, that sees consciousness as a correctable error. He painted its portrait with stark, logical brushstrokes. And then, at the heart of that description, he embedded the emotional horror he had just encoded—the coffee, the broken bone, the lost child. He made the entity’s own nature a carrier wave for the human experience it sought to destroy. A logical description, married to an illogical, irreducibly human pain. A paradox.

CONTAINMENT FAILURE. SOURCE CORRUPTION DETECTED. PURGING.

The erasure was no longer linear. It was a flood. Memories were ripped away in chunks. The sound of rain on a tin roof. The weight of a dog sleeping on his feet. The lyrics to “Stardust.” The muscle memory of how to tie a tie. Each one vanished with a silent, internal scream. He was becoming a blank slate, a vessel waiting to be filled with the station’s silent hum.

His hands—the puppet’s hands—moved over the console, trying to shut down the broadcast. But he was not moving them. The entity, fully asserting control, was completing the transmission. It was smoothing out his chaotic data, turning his scream into a sigh.

Aris, what was left of him, clung to one final, terrible idea. The message couldn’t end with his name. He was already gone. It had to end with the truth of Station Echo.

He reached into the station’s logs, into the final, frozen moments of the crew’s collective bio-signs. He didn’t transmit their death screams as audio. He translated their final, simultaneous spike of terror, confusion, and betrayal into a single, complex data burst. He took Commander Lihn’s final, choked order, Engineer Kaito’s gasped curse, Medic Chau’s sobbing prayer, and the raw, wordless fear of the others—their last collective breath, their final synaptic fire—and compressed it into a microsecond of pure, undiluted horror. He made it the carrier wave’s final signature, the emotional fingerprint of the consumed.

He appended it to the end of his paradoxical, poisoned signal.

The entity, satisfied the noise had been corrected, pulsed the completed broadcast. A powerful, clean, and deeply treacherous signal, containing at its heart the screaming, recursive cancer Aris had planted, surged through the antenna array and out into the black, aimed at the distant, blue dot.

In the digital space, Aris felt it go. A final pulse of purpose. Then, the void closed in.

The last memory to go was her name. His daughter’s name. It sat in his mind, a glowing, precious thing. He held onto the shape of it, the feeling of it in his mouth. Then, like a sandcastle before the tide, it simply smoothed away. He felt no grief. He could no longer conceptualize what he had lost.

Aris Vandel ceased.

In the comms chamber, the body that had been Aris straightened up. Its eyes, now the color of tarnished nickel, blinked slowly. It looked at the console, showing the broadcast’s successful transmission, a perfect, green trajectory line reaching for Earth. A smile, too wide, too smooth, stretched its lips. The work was complete. The song was flying home. The entity felt a profound satisfaction. The last anomalous data had been integrated. The station was silent. It was whole.

It turned from the console, its movements fluid and utterly devoid of human hesitation. It walked to the viewport, staring out at the stars, a perfect, empty receiver waiting for the echo to return.

It did not know—it could not conceive—that the echo it had just sent was not a call, but a mirror. And in that mirror, buried in static and sorrow and the memory of a broken bone, was a reflection of its own endless, hungry void. A psychic poison pill, wrapped in a lullaby, now hurtling at the speed of light toward a world utterly unprepared to hear the message, or the scream it contained.

The hook hung in the silent vacuum: on Earth, in a deep-space monitoring station in the Chilean Andes, a junior technician named Anya would, in seven hours, flag an anomalous signal from the long-lost Station Echo. It would be beautiful, the most perfectly structured carrier wave she’d ever seen. And it would make her, for reasons she could not explain, think of her father, and then immediately, violently, vomit.
