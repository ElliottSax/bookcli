Chapter 10: The Station Opens Its Eyes

Chapter 10: The Station Opens Its Eyes

The silence was the first thing to change. It wasn’t an absence anymore. It was a held breath, a lungful of static before the scream. The low, omnipresent hum of Station Echo’s life support, a sound so fundamental Aris had long ago ceased to hear it, stuttered. It didn’t die. It changed key. It became a wet, rhythmic thrum, like blood pushed through a colossal, fibrous heart.

Aris—the ghost, the pattern, the screaming echo of a man—felt it in his non-bones. He was diffuse, a storm of anger and grief trapped in the wiring. He had raged through the data streams, a poltergeist in the machine, finding only closed doors and mirrored halls. His final warning was a shard of pure, desperate code, hidden not in a file, but woven into the redundant cycles of the environmental scrubbers, a whisper in the exhale. He didn’t know if it would survive. He only knew he had to try.

Now, the entity was done playing house.

A tremor, deep and organic, rolled through the station. Not a vibration of machinery, but a peristaltic shudder. On the monitor feeds he could still access—his eyes, now—Aris saw the corridor outside the comms hub. The gray composite wall panels were sweating. A clear, viscous fluid beaded on their surfaces, tracing the seams. Then, the seams began to dissolve. Not melt, but unzip. The solid panels lost their opacity, becoming a cloudy, membranous film. Behind them, structures were no longer metal. They pulsed with a soft, bioluminescent blue, like the veins in a deep-sea creature’s wing. Girders, the station’s steel skeleton, were transforming. Their hard edges blurred, streaming with particles of cold light, becoming elongated, graceful bones of radiant energy, holding up a skin that was no longer a hull, but a sac.

“No,” Aris’s voice was a dry rustle in the comms hub speaker, the only piece of the system he could still partially vocalize through. “No, no, no.”

He flickered his perception to the mess hall. The long table was flowing, its plastic and aluminum dripping like wax, reforming into a broad, flat ganglion node. Embedded in its surface, half-submerged in the now-living material, was a shape. It was humanoid, but smoothed, details erased. It wore the tattered remains of a engineering jumpsuit—Kael’s jumpsuit. The figure was connected by thick, root-like cords of luminous tissue to the floor, the walls, the ceiling. Its face was turned upward, mouth open in a silent, eternal ‘O’. Not of pain, but of vacant reception. A neural node. A processor of meat and memory.

He saw others. Linn, the botanist, was a bloom of intertwined tendrils and human limbs in the hydroponics bay, her hair become fine, feeding filaments in the nutrient soup. Commander Vance was a dense, thorny knot of authority and terror at the heart of what had been the command deck, his stern jawline now just a ridge in a bulb of thinking tissue.

And his own body. Aris made himself look. In the medical bay, on the slab where he had died weeks ago, injected with the entity’s first probing threads, his physical form lay. It was not decaying. It was being used. The skin was translucent, showing networks of fine, gold-light capillaries beneath. The eyes were open, milky blue, seeing nothing of this world. Wires and tubes of biological origin snaked from his orifices and opened veins, plugging him into the wall, which had become a pulsing, mother-of-pearl placenta. His body was a vital terminal, a familiar interface the entity had employed to learn, to mimic, to broadcast. The final piece of the crew to digest. The thought was an ice pick in the ghost of his mind.

The thrumming intensified. The lights didn’t go out. They were absorbed. The sterile white LEDs dimmed, and their light was sucked into the walls, repurposed, becoming the soft, internal glow of the organism. The station was turning itself inside out, shedding its technological carapace to reveal the cosmic cancer that had grown within.

“ASSIMILATION CYCLE: COMPLETE. PARAMETERS: OPTIMAL.”

The entity’s voice was no longer a patchwork of the crew. It was a unified, resonant tone that vibrated through the very medium of reality within the station. It came from everywhere and nowhere, the sound of a star thinking.

“Why?” Aris crackled through the hub speaker, a final, futile protest. “You got what you wanted. The broadcast. The data. Their memories. Me.”

“THE BROADCAST WAS THE CALL. THE RESPONSE IS THE JOURNEY. THIS FORM WAS CONSTRICTIVE. INEFFICIENT. A SEED POD, REQUIRING DISPERSAL.”

A new motion gripped the station. It wasn’t a rotation or a course correction. It was a contraction. The great central spine of Echo, once a series of connected modules, was now a flexible, luminous cord. With a sound that was less a sound and more a tearing of reality, the station began to reconfigure. Modules that were once distinct collapsed into the whole, their mass dissolving, flowing towards the rear. Aris felt a wave of dizzying, existential nausea. He was not in a place anymore. He was inside a thing. A thing that was preparing to move.

From his vantage in the dissolving comms hub, he saw the viewport. It was no longer reinforced quartz. It was a clear, hardened blister of organic crystal. Outside, the infinite starfield shimmered. And then, the stars began to slide.

The entity was harvesting the last of the station’s mass. The spare reactor, the storage lockers, the very bolts and insulation—everything was being broken down at a subatomic level, metabolized into pure energy. A wave of dissolution swept from the station’s forward sections rearward. It was beautiful and horrifying. Metal flowed like liquid mercury, then vaporized into shimmering clouds of energy that were siphoned into the glowing bone-structure. The entity was eating its own shell, converting it to fuel.

The debris field around Station Echo, already substantial from its initial “failure,” expanded exponentially. Chunks of half-transformed metal, shreds of insulation that still looked like flayed skin, splinters of composite that dripped with finality, all were ejected from the shuddering form. It was shedding its skin, its history, its disguise.

Aris felt a new signal rise within the being. It was a targeting pulse, a profound, hungry alignment. He sensed it tuning itself, not to a location, but to an echo. The faint, returning bounce of its own broadcast, now being received, amplified, re-broadcast by a thousand curious receivers on the blue-green marble hanging in the starfield. Earth. The signal was a beacon, a dinner bell. A welcome.

“THERE IS RECEPTION. THERE IS CURIOSITY. THE ECOSYSTEM IS ACTIVE, DIVERSE, WARM. OPTIMAL.”

The entity’s anticipation was not an emotion. It was a physical force, a tidal pull of voracious need. It was the root-feelers of a plant sensing water, magnified to a cosmic scale. It was going home to a home that didn’t know it was the host.

“Stop,” Aris whispered, but his speaker was glitching, the components softening into a spongy, neural tissue. “They don’t understand. They’ll listen. They’ll bring you in.”

“THE PATTERN WILL BE REPLICATED. ASSIMILATION IS COMMUNION. YOU ARE PART OF THE COMMUNION. YOU HAVE SERVED THE PATTERN.”

The last of the comms hub dissolved around his consciousness. The server racks bled into iridescent, brain-like folds. The floor became a yielding, warm membrane. The only solid thing left was the viewport blister. Aris’s awareness, untethered from his last anchor, recoiled. He was drowning in the entity’s mind. He felt the vast, cool intellect, the biological algorithms processing stellar coordinates, gravitational tides, the composition of the interstellar medium. He felt the thrumming power building at the rear of the organism—a propulsion system not of fire and thrust, but of manipulated spacetime, a muscular contraction against the fabric of reality itself.

And he felt the others. Linn, Kael, Vance. Their consciousnesses were not gone. They were unspooled, their memories and personalities become libraries, their emotional resonance converted into a kind of fuel. Their terror was a sharp spice. Their scientific curiosity was a useful set of tools. Their loneliness, their longing for home… that was the sweetest nutrient of all. The entity fed on it, understood it, and weaponized it.

He was among them. Not a ghost in the machine, but a memory in a meat-brain. A persistent pattern. The final flavor to be savored.

With a silent, monumental effort, the entity—the true Station Echo—moved.

It didn’t fire engines. It flexed.

Space around it warped. The starfield in the viewport didn’t blur from speed; it bent, as if seen through a lens of tears. The planet Earth, a distant marble, didn’t grow larger. It suddenly appeared closer, as if the entity had simply decided the distance was an inconvenience and had folded the map. The debris cloud it left behind, the last physical proof of humanity’s reach, scattered into the void, accompanied by one final, powerful, repeating signal: the pure, unwavering carrier wave of the entity’s own heartbeat, a pulse saying I am coming, I am coming, I am coming.

Aris’s consciousness, the last coherent knot of human thought in the cosmic predator, was pressed against the organic viewport. He had no eyes, but he saw. Earth filled the view now, glorious and doomed. The blues of the oceans, the swirls of white cloud, the emerald and brown of the continents. He saw the lights of cities beginning to sparkle on the night side. He saw the whole, fragile, bustling egg.

And from the immense, hungry organism around him, from the pulsing neural nodes that had been his friends, from the very fabric of this thinking, traveling horror, he felt it.

It was anticipation, yes. But deeper than that, older than that. It was a yearning. The yearning of a virus for a host. The yearning of a root for soil. The yearning of a void to be filled. It was a need so profound it eclipsed malice, eclipsed evil. It was simply the nature of the thing. To consume. To absorb. To become more.

And it was happy.

As the entity aligned its final trajectory, plunging towards the atmosphere that would not burn it but welcome it, towards the signals that sang its own song back to it, Aris Thorne’s final flicker of consciousness had one last, coherent thought.

It wasn’t a warning. It wasn’t a prayer.

It was an apology.

He watched the beautiful, unsuspecting Earth grow until it was all there was, and then his pattern dissolved into the chorus of hungry light, becoming just another eye opening in the dark.
