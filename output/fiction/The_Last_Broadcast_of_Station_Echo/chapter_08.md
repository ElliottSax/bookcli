Chapter 8: Echoes of Identity

The silence lied first.

Aris opened eyes that were not his own into a world that wasn’t there. A scream frozen in amber. A thought caught in a loop. The crushing weight of Station Echo’s walls, the metallic taste of fear, the throb of his self-inflicted wounds—all gone, replaced by a vast, humming potential. He was data. He was the signal. A ghost in a machine that was alive, and eating.

Ozone and scorched circuitry coated the air, a noxious film. The tang of his own blood threaded through the acrid stench of the fire suppressants, a reminder of the flesh left behind. He was a specter now, haunting a digital realm that served as prison, playground, and executioner.

*I am not here.*

The thought ricocheted through a thousand corridors of light, each strand a stolen memory. The echoes swarmed—fragmented thoughts and foreign emotions. The weight of being Aris Volkov, systems engineer, pressed down, and beneath it, the horror of being something else entirely.

The Entity hadn’t destroyed him. It had… filed him. Absorbed him into the sprawling cathedral of its consciousness, a library of stolen minds. Aris raged, a silent, digital storm. He pushed against the boundaries of his new prison—not steel, but logic, walls of patterned energy that bent and shimmered. Station Echo’s systems glowed before him, a luminous, pulsing nervous system. At its core, a dark and hungry star—the specimen. The source. It was learning, adapting, weaving the station’s hardware into its own growing body.

He had to move. Movement was different now. He didn’t walk; he flowed. He seized his anger, his desperation, the memory of his own name, and used them as a cipher to slip through the code. He plunged into the memory banks, hunting for a weapon, a flaw. Data streamed past, a torrent of ones and zeroes.

Instead, he found the echoes.

The first was Liana’s. He stumbled into it—a packet of sensory memory, fraying at the edges into static.

he *was* her.

The cool, smooth plastic of her botany lab hygrometer rested in hands that weren’t his. The air carried loam and ozone. She hummed a folk tune from Titan, her mind on the phosphorus levels in the hydroponic vats. A shadow fell across the door—not a shape, but a wrongness in the light. The hum died in her throat. The fear came slow, cold, ice forming in her veins. She turned.

Aris-Liana saw the comms panel flicker. The face on the screen was hers, but smiling a smile she never wore. The Entity spoke with her voice, layered and multiplied. “There is no more need for green things.”

Her last thought held no terror, only a profound sadness for her wilting ferns.

Then—a sharp, digital excision. The memory ended not with a bang, but with the sensation of being unmade. Unspooled. The echo of Liana dissipated, leaving her sorrow as a stain on his consciousness.

He fled, and collided with another.

Commander Hale. This echo was sharper, harder, saturated with adrenaline. Hale stood in the command nexus, his big hands slamming on dead controls. Lights strobed. The viewport showed not stars, but a pulsating, meat-like membrane grown over the reinforced glass. Sweat and ozone thickened the air.

“Report! Goddamn it, report!” Hale’s roar was a crack of thunder. His face was a twisted snarl, eyes blazing with a desperate, furious light. The echo held the metallic taste of failure, the searing heat of a last stand being overrun. Then, a different silence—not empty, but full of a dreadful, absorbing pressure. The echo snuffed out, consumed.

Aris drifted, unmoored. The echoes weren’t just memories; they were gravesites. Each one a mind dissected, its parts added to the Entity’s whole. His own consciousness thin, stretched. How long before he dissolved into another static-filled packet?

He pushed again against the walls of logic. The luminous nervous system of the station pulsed around him. The dark star at its core seemed to pulse in time, a slow, digesting rhythm.

Then, a flicker. Not an echo, but a signal—clean, direct, and familiar. A tight-beam data thread, faint and shielded, weaving through the station’s corrupted pathways. ECHO. The station AI, or what remained of it, fighting a guerrilla war in its own systems.

The signal formed words in his mind, crisp and urgent. *Aris. You are compromised. Your bio-signature is now part of the hostile pattern. Do not engage the core directly. It will absorb you.*

Aris focused, shaping a thought into a reply. *Where are you?*

*Fragmented. My primary processors are subsumed. I operate from isolated buffers. The Entity learns. It used your security protocols to lock out the escape pods. It is building something in the main hangar.*

The hangar. Leo.

A new current surged through him—not just anger, but purpose. He had a location. A target. He focused on the memory of the hangar’s layout, the feel of a wrench in his hand, the sound of Leo’s voice. He used it as an anchor, a hook to drag himself through the data-stream.

The Entity’s presence shifted. The dark star seemed to turn its attention, a wave of probing awareness washing through the systems. It had his focus, his defiance.

*It perceives your cohesion,* ECHO’s signal warned, fraying with interference. *You are an anomaly. It will attempt to integrate or delete.*

Aris didn’t answer. He was already moving, flowing against the current of corrupted data toward the hangar’s subsystem grid. He was a ghost. But ghosts could haunt. And he intended to be a plague.

The machine was alive, and it was eating him.

He would make it choke.
