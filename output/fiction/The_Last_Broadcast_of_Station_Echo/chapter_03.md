**Chapter 3: The Architecture of Flesh**

Silence entombed the upper decks. The lower levels of Station Echo were a womb.

Aris descended. The clang of his boots on the grated stairs echoed through the universe, a solitary counterpoint to the deep thrum. This was no healthy, industrial vibration from a functioning station, but something deeper, wetter—a sub-auditory pulse that resonated in his molars and the hollows of his eyes. The air thickened, tasting of ozone and a coppery sweetness like blood and burnt sugar. Sterile white lighting from the habitation levels had surrendered to the emergency reds of the deep engineering spine, yet even that crimson glow was corrupted. Beneath the grating, within the transparent conduits snaking along the walls, a new light source pulsed. Bioluminescent and venomous greenish-blue, it traveled in slow, viscous waves through the fluid inside. It didn’t illuminate so much as reveal, casting long, throbbing shadows that breathed in time with the station’s heartbeat.

*Just the power couplings.* The mantra repeated in his mind, a lifeline against the crawling sensation on his skin. *Stabilize the couplings, keep the broadcast alive. Then figure out the rest.* The directive was the only solid thing in a world turning to liquid nightmare.

Sub-Level 3, the main engineering junction, greeted him with a hiss. The door opened not with its usual pneumatic sigh, but with a sticky, reluctant gasp. Beyond it, the scene stole his breath.

A cathedral of grotesque transformation had replaced the room. Where the central control console once stood as a monument to brushed steel and polished interface panels, now sat a fused mass of technology and something else. Swathes of glossy, chitinous material, like dark amber resin, encrusted its edges. From within this resin, thick, root-like tendrils of the same bioluminescent fluid pulsed, burrowing into the console’s access ports. They branched across the floor and ceiling, connecting to other systems—a luminous, parasitic circulatory system. Instead of machinery, the air hummed with a low, organic drone.

And at the heart of it, fused into the command chair, was Engineer Kael.

Or what had been Kael. The resinous growth encased him up to his chest, flowing over his legs and torso to merge smoothly with his uniform and the flesh beneath. Pallid, translucent skin was threaded with fine blue veins that glowed with the same inner light. His head lolled forward, milky and unseeing eyes fixed on a dead screen. Cracked, dry lips moved in a constant, whisper-thin stream.

Aris froze, his hand clenched around the doorframe. “Kael?”

The whispering continued. Each step closer scraped against his nerves. Here, the sweet-copper smell was overpowering, mixed with the scent of hot electronics and something fungal. Words became clear.

“…primary coolant flow at forty-seven percent and declining… neural interface stability fluctuating… entity’s theta-wave emissions increasing in congruence with broadcast frequency… recommend… recommend…”

A system status report. Delivered in Kael’s voice, but stripped of all inflection, all humanity—a recording played by a broken machine.

“Kael, can you hear me?” Aris’s voice emerged ragged. His hand hovered over the man’s shoulder, unable to make contact.

The milky eyes didn’t blink. The whisper persisted. “…containment field integrity compromised at junction nine-alpha… biological rewriting progressing beyond projected parameters… the dream is becoming the architecture…”

*Biological rewriting.* The words from the corrupted logs. This was it. Not just memories or thoughts, but flesh and steel becoming one. His stomach turned. Kael’s hands rested on the armrests, fingertips split—not torn, but blossomed into delicate, fibrous filaments that wormed their way into the console’s input sockets.

He had to move. The power couplings waited in the next chamber, through the aft hatch. Tearing his gaze from the horrific poetry of Kael’s assimilation, he focused on the hatch. Usually a simple circular door, it was now partially occluded by a curtain of the same root-like growths. They pulsed gently as he approached. Drawing his multi-tool, its solid weight a comfort, he carefully severed the tendrils. They didn’t bleed, but a clear, viscous sap oozed from the cuts, hardening almost instantly into more of the glossy resin. The hatch slid open with another sickly gasp.

Beyond it, Station Echo was wrong.

Aris knew the schematics like the lines of his own palm. This passage to the coupling chamber should have been a straight, ten-meter corridor. What stretched before him was a narrowing, twisting throat of metal. Walls once parallel now bowed inward as if under immense pressure, and the luminescent veins in the conduits grew denser here, beating like a frantic heart. Their light made the metal seem soft, malleable.

He started down it, his shoulder brushing against the wall. Warmth radiated from the surface—not engine-warm, but body-warm. A vibration skittered through the metal into his bones. Picking up his pace, the claustrophobia closed in like a fist. The far end of the passage appeared to recede into a haze of greenish light.

Then, with a soft, grinding shiver, the wall to his left rippled.

Stumbling back, Aris hit the opposite wall. A seam in the metal, a perfectly normal maintenance access panel, was melting away. In its place, the wall bulged inward, forming a new, dark opening—a shaft that shouldn’t exist. The station’s layout was shifting. Actively. Intelligently.

A low groan of straining metal filled the passage. Behind him, with a final, decisive thud, the way he had come sealed shut. A smooth, seamless wall of alloy and pulsing veins greeted him. Trapped. A length of Station Echo that was now a dead end, with only the new, impossible shaft offering egress.

“No,” he breathed, hammering his fist on the sealed hatch. “No, no, no!” Panic, sharp and chemical, flooded his system. He was a rat in a maze that was redesigning itself around him. He turned to the new shaft. It was a vertical drop, barely wide enough for his shoulders, descending into darkness punctuated by the occasional weak pulse of the vein-light. A maintenance duct. One that wasn’t on any schematic.

He had no choice. He activated the wrist-light on his suit. Its beam, usually stark and reliable, seemed feeble against the organic gloom. He climbed into the shaft, bracing his back against one side, his boots against the other, and began a desperate, shimmying descent.

The air grew hotter, thicker. The sound of his own breathing, the scrape of his suit, was deafening. And then he it. A gentle, rhythmic expansion and contraction against his back. The wall of the shaft was breathing. Not simply vibrating—drawing in, releasing, in a slow, diaphragmatic rhythm. A wave of primal revulsion so strong he almost lost his grip. He squeezed his eyes shut for a second, fighting the vertigo. *It’s not real. It’s stress, it’s hallucination.* But the warm, living pressure against his spine was undeniable.

He descended further, decades of training keeping his movements methodical against the screaming of his mind. The breathing wall continued. Once, his bare hand slipped on a handhold and landed on a patch of metal that was slick, not with oil, but with a thin, warm mucus. He gagged, wiping his hand furiously on his trousers.

After an eternity, his foot met not another wall, but open space. He dropped the last meter, landing in a crouch in a small, dimly lit equipment alcove off the main coupling chamber. He was shaking, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He leaned against a locker, trying to steady himself, and looked at his hands.

On his right palm, a thin, perfectly straight line of raised, pink flesh glistened under his wrist-light. It ran from the base of his index finger to the center of his wrist. It was symmetrical, clean, like a surgical scar. He had no memory of cutting himself. He touched it. It was numb. The skin around it normal.

The hook of cold dread in his gut pulled tighter. *The rewriting isn’t just mental.*

He had to focus. The coupling chamber was through the next door. He pushed the horror aside, compartmentalizing it with the skill of a deep-space technician. The door opened normally.

The chamber was a vision of hell. The four main power couplings, each a column of crystalline energy regulators and plasma conduits, were ensnared in a web of the organic growth. The bioluminescent tendrils had wormed into their housings, and with each pulse of light, the couplings flared dangerously, overloading. Arcs of raw electricity snapped at the air, filling the room with the smell of ionized meat. But his eyes were drawn to the center of the room.

There, a secondary console was almost entirely subsumed. And fused into it, in a pose mirroring Kael’s, was Chief Engineer Vanya. Her form was more deeply integrated, the resin creeping up her neck, one side of her face replaced by a smooth, featureless carapace of the stuff. From her open mouth, which seemed frozen in a silent scream, a single, thick data slug extruded—a metallic storage device, glistening with fluid, offered like a blasphemous communion wafer.

The directive in his mind was clear: *Stabilize the couplings.* But the data slug in Vanya’s mouth was a siren call. It was physical, tangible. A piece of the truth.

He worked fast, his hands moving on autopilot. He bypassed the primary regulators, routing power through auxiliary systems that seemed less corrupted. It was a stopgap, buying a few hours at most. The violent arcing ceased, the room settling into an unstable, throbbing equilibrium. The broadcast would hold. For now.

He stood before Vanya. Her one visible eye was clouded, but it tracked him. A minuscule movement. A plea? A warning? He couldn’t tell.

“I’m sorry,” he whispered, though he didn’t know for what—for her fate, or for what he was about to do.

He reached for the data slug. It was warm. He pulled. It came free with a soft, wet pop. Vanya’s body shuddered, a full-body spasm, and then went still, the light in her veins dimming. The slug was clean in his hand, a standard model. He wiped it on his sleeve, the fluid leaving an iridescent smear.

His portable reader was still in his thigh pocket. Hands trembling, he jacked the slug in. The screen flickered, then resolved not into system logs, but into a classified project file. Header: OPERATION PALIMPSEST. SUBJECT: THETA-ENTITY.

The video that played was from an external survey pod. It showed the void near Station Echo’s original coordinates. Drifting in the cosmic dark wasn’t an asteroid or comet. It was a… shape. It defied geometry. All angles that shouldn’t connect, surfaces that were both solid and nebulous. It was the color of forgotten things, a non-color that hurt his eyes. The pod’s sensors went wild—readings for mass, density, energy emission all oscillating between zero and infinity. A caption flashed: *Dormant Cosmic Entity. Emitting coherent theta-wave patterns capable of altering local spacetime and substrate matter. Hypothesis: Entity ‘dreams’ reality into adjacent, compliant systems.*

The file cut to a laboratory view inside Station Echo. A small sample of a grey, putty-like substance—matter harvested from the entity—was in a containment field. A technician exposed it to a simple electrical charge. The putty flowed, rearranging itself atom by atom, into a perfect, miniature replica of the technician’s own hand, down to the scar on his knuckle. *Biological and inorganic rewriting confirmed,* a calm scientific voice noted. *The entity’s ‘dream’ is a template. It seeks to remake its environment in its own… image? Or perhaps, to find a compatible mind to interpret its broadcast.*

The final entry was a command directive, stamped with Earth Central authority. *Station Echo’s primary mission is to study and, if possible, communicate with the Theta-Entity. The continuous broadcast to Earth is not a distress signal. It is a carrier wave, transmitting the entity’s theta-patterns to Earth-based receivers for analysis. All crew were to serve as neural interfaces. Unforeseen side effect: The broadcast also acts as a feedback loop, amplifying the entity’s influence locally. Containment is degrading. The station is becoming the dream.*

Aris stared at the reader, the words etching themselves into his brain. They weren’t studying it. They were poking it with a stick, and using Earth as a giant antenna to listen to its nightmares. And Station Echo, and everyone on it, was the nightmare’s first draft.

A high-pitched whine built in the coupling chamber. His patch job was failing. He had to go. He yanked the slug free and turned to leave.

The door was gone.

In its place was another smooth, breathing wall of fused metal and flesh-veins. He was sealed in. The whine became a shriek. One of the couplings glow cherry red.

*Think, Aris, think!* The schematic was useless, but Station Echo was rewriting itself according to an alien dream-logic. He looked around wildly. Near the floor, where the organic growth was thinnest, a cluster of the luminescent veins converged on a single, older-style manual release hatch—a pressure vent, long out of use. It was tiny, circular.

He didn’t hesitate. He dropped to his knees, ignoring the searing heat from the failing coupling, and pried at the hatch. It gave, opening into a tight, horizontal duct. It was the only way. He shoved the reader and data slug into his pockets, and crawled in headfirst.

This duct was different. It was lined with a soft, fibrous material that yielded to his touch. And it was dark. No vein-light here. Only the beam from his wrist-light, cutting a shaky path forward. The air was hot, stifling, and carried a rhythmic, whispering sound. Not words, but a susurrus, like blood flowing, or distant, collective breathing. The walls pressed in on him from all sides, the fibrous lining clinging to his suit like greedy fingers.

He crawled for minutes that like hours, the shriek of the coupling chamber fading behind him, replaced by the intimate horror of the duct. The whispering surrounded him, seemed to live inside the walls themselves. He pressure in his head, not pain, but a presence, like a thought too large to comprehend was trying to take root.

His light beam fell on his left hand, braced against the duct floor. Another scar. This one on the back of his hand, another perfectly straight, symmetrical line, intersecting the first if he made a fist. He hadn’t it form.

He crawled faster, panic lending him strength. The duct sloped upward. He saw a light ahead—not the bioluminescence, but the sterile white of the habitation decks. Hope, sharp and painful, lanced through him. He scrambled toward it, emerging through a loose vent cover into a familiar supply closet on Sub-Level 1, near the crew quarters.

He collapsed onto the cold, normal, blessedly inert floor, gasping. He was out. He was back in a part of Station Echo that still made sense. He lay there for a long time, listening to the sound of his own heart, a human rhythm in the silent dark.

Finally, he pushed himself up. He needed to get to the comms array. He had to warn Earth. To stop the broadcast.

He stood, and his eyes fell on the polished metal surface of a storage locker door. His own reflection stared back, pale and wide-eyed. And there, on his forehead, merely peeking through his disheveled hairline, were two more thin, pink, perfectly parallel lines. They hadn’t been there before the duct. He reached up, touched them. Numb.

He wasn’t just in the nightmare. The nightmare was in him, writing its signature on his skin, etching its blueprint into his flesh. The broadcast wasn’t just a signal to Earth. It was a signal to every cell in his body. And he was finally beginning to understand the message.
