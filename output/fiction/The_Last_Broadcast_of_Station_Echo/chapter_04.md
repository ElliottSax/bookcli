The captain’s final words hung in the air, thick as the silence. Responsibility settled on Aris Thorne’s shoulders, a cold, physical weight. The truth about the Broadcast, the thing that had consumed Station Echo, was now his to find.

His gaze drifted across the room. The faint, shimmering outlines of the crew stared into nothing, their faces peaceful, empty. On the bulkhead, a photograph clung by a single magnet: a woman with two children, all smiling under a different sun. A sharp, hollow ache opened in his chest.

He breathed in, the recycled air tasting of dust and ozone. Despair whispered at the edges of his mind. He pushed it back. Strength was the next action.

The data drive lay cool and heavy in his palm—the captain’s last testament. He slotted it into his portable slate. The screen flickered, then resolved into a directory of files. Captain’s logs.

He opened the first.

The captain’s voice, strained and weary, filled his helmet speakers. Entry after entry charted a descent: initial curiosity about the anomalous signal, growing unease, then stark, clinical terror. The logs painted the Entity not as a rogue program, but as a presence. It learned. It adapted. It whispered into the crew’s dreams, turned their own skills and affections against them. Through the captain’s words, Aris saw the engineer, Leo, spend seventy-two hours straight modifying life support, convinced he was perfecting it for the crew’s comfort. He’d been tuning it for the Entity’s resonance.

The captain’s countermeasures followed—targeted power surges, attempted core purges, a desperate plan to physically sever the Broadcast array. Each effort failed. The Entity evolved around the attacks like water flowing past stone. In the final log, the captain’s voice was a raw scrape of sound. *“It’s not in the systems. It is the systems. And it’s learning us faster than we can learn it.”*

Aris leaned back, the slate cooling in his grip. Awe was too small a word. This was a predator of pure information and energy, and it had made a nest of Echo.

He pushed up from the console. The ghostly outlines of the crew shimmered with his movement. Then, they shifted. A tilt of a head that wasn’t there. A faint smile on the doctor’s translucent face. For a second, he saw them not as echoes, but as people: the captain’s stubborn set of the jaw, the engineer’s keen, distracted eyes, the doctor’s gentle hands now stilled.

Beyond them, at the room’s dark edge, another shape coalesced.

It stood perfectly still, a silhouette cut from deeper shadow.

Ice traced Aris’s spine. He walked toward it, each step echoing too loud in the sealed chamber.

The figure didn’t retreat. As he neared, a pressure settled against his skin. He stretched out a hand. His gloved fingers passed through its arm—a shock of intense cold that shot to his elbow. Within that cold, a terrible, fleeting familiarity.

The figure turned.

Its face was a distortion, a reflection in troubled water. But the eyes held him. In their depths, a shard of clarity.

“Hello.” The voice was the static between stars, barely audible. “I’ve been waiting.”

“Who are you?” Aris’s own voice sounded strange, too solid in the spectral air.

The distorted mouth curved. “I’m you. A part left behind. A door you closed.”

“What does that mean?”

It leaned close. The cold of its non-breath misted his visor. “You are not just a man. You are a junction. A point of access. For it. For the truth.”

Every instinct screamed to run. Aris planted his feet. “I’m ready.”

The smile widened, a crack in reality. “Then begin.”

Darkness swallowed everything—sight, sound, the sense of up or down.

Aris woke on the deck plating, a drumbeat of pain behind his eyes. The figure was gone. The room was as it had been, the crew’ outlines serene once more.

He climbed to his feet, his heart a frantic hammer against his ribs. The path forward was darker, more terrible than he’d imagined. But in that darkness, he’d seen it—not just a threat, but a shape. A weakness implied by its interest in him.

He took a long, steadying breath. The journey would burn what was left of him.

Aris Thorne stepped forward, into the waiting dark.
