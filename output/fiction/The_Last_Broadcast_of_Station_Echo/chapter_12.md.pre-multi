Chapter 12: Carrier Wave

Chapter 12: Carrier Wave

The sky began to sing, and that was when Leo knew they were truly out of time.

It wasn’t a song you heard with your ears. It was a pressure in the teeth, a vibration in the marrow of the shin bone, a phantom scent of ozone and wet chalk that lived in the back of the throat. It was the world tuning a string, a single, pure note of intent that flattened the random noise of existence. From his makeshift nest in the attic of the old KZPN radio station in Portland, Leo watched through a grime-caked skylight as the clouds over Mount Hood smoothed themselves into perfect, parallel ridges, like a frozen sea of gray silk. They pulsed in time with the song in his bones.

“It’s here,” he whispered, his breath fogging the cold glass.

Below, in the master control room that smelled of dust, solder, and stale panic, the others felt it too. Maya, a former sound engineer with eyes that hadn’t known sleep since she’d dreamt of Aris’s warning, flinched as her array of scavenged oscilloscopes and spectrum analyzers screamed in unison. The needles didn’t just peg; they danced a graceful, synchronized waltz across their dials. “Signal strength is increasing exponentially,” she called out, her voice tight. “It’s not just a broadcast anymore. It’s a… a field. It’s bending local reality. GPS is painting downtown as a perfect square. Traffic lights in a twenty-block radius are cycling in unison. People are reporting that all the birds are landing and facing north-east. Not a single one is out of step.”

Samir, a poet who had tried to describe the signal’s effect and found his words rearranging themselves on the page into sterile, beautiful equations, rubbed at his temples. “It’s the pattern. It’s seeking coherence. Erasing outliers.”

They were the outliers. The immune. Not because they were stronger, but because their minds were wired with a different kind of static. Aris’s final broadcast—a shriek of data masquerading as a test pattern—hadn’t filled them with revelation. It had given them a psychic migraine. Leo had seen the station’s walls breathe. Maya had tasted the color of the entity’s hunger, a flavor like cold silver and forgotten birthdays. Samir’s skin had crawled with the sensation of infinite, identical eyes blinking in unison. Where the infected found sublime order and peace, they had felt a predatory, consolidating madness. They’d found each other online, in the forgotten corners of the web not yet smoothed into uniformity, speaking in broken code and shared sensory nightmares.

The attic door banged open. Felix, a wiry, aging ham radio operator who was their lifeline to the other scattered pockets of resistance, hauled up a final car battery, his face ashen. “It’s not just a signal from space anymore,” he panted. “It’s entering the atmosphere. Look.”

They crowded the skylight. Beyond the geometrically perfect clouds, the heavens were bleeding light. Not the fiery streak of a meteor, but a slow, viscous descent of iridescence. It unfurled like a phosphorescent jellyfish the size of a continent, tendrils of gossamer light—emerald, cobalt, amethyst—drifting down through the stratosphere. It was breathtaking. It was the most beautiful thing Leo had ever seen, and it made his bladder feel weak with terror. The aurora shimmered in perfect, rhythmic patterns, a visual representation of the carrier wave now soaking the planet. Where it touched, the very air seemed to simplify. The chaotic dance of dust motes in a sunbeam became a regimented march. The sound of the wind faded into a soft, consistent hum.

“It’s an aesthetic,” Samir murmured, horrified. “It’s making reality… tasteful.”

“Then we fight bad taste,” Leo said, turning from the window. His heart was a frantic drum against his ribs. The plan was insane. It was their only plan.

The master control room was a monument to beautiful chaos. KZPN had been a community station, and they had ransacked it for every piece of analog, unpredictable gear they could find. Reel-to-reel tape decks were wired into the broadcast chain, some tapes holding symphony recordings, others holding the sound of a toddler’s birthday party from 1997, or the screech of a subway train rounding a curve. A theremin, its pitch controlled by the proximity of the player’s hand, stood hooked to a transmitter. Felix’s prize was a vintage rotary-dial telephone, its electrical pulse-dialing signal patched in as a rhythmic, erratic heartbeat. Maya had jury-rigged a camera to capture a pot of boiling water and translate the random, swirling convection patterns into audio frequencies. This was their weapon: a cacophony of the human experience. Not a message, but an anti-message. A celebration of noise.

“We have one shot,” Maya said, her fingers flying over the patching board. “We boost everything through the main tower, override every frequency we can touch. We don’t argue with its logic. We give it a seizure.”

“It’ll hear us,” Felix said, glancing at the beautiful, descending light. “It’ll come here first.”

“Let it,” Leo said. He picked up a microphone, its grille dented. He didn’t know what he would say. That was the point.

The entity’s aurora made contact with the highest atmosphere. The song in their bones became a physical force. The walls of the station groaned. The dust on the floor began to arrange itself into intricate, Mandelbrot-like patterns. Leo felt a pressure in his mind, a soft, insistent hand trying to smooth out the wrinkles of his fear, his love for his lost sister, his irrational hatred of lima beans—all of it into a serene, blank acceptance.

“Now!” Maya screamed.

She threw the master switch.

The station didn’t broadcast. It vomited.

A wall of sound erupted from the tower. It was the opening chords of Beethoven’s Ninth, immediately layered with a recording of a man sobbing uncontrollably, then torn through by the atonal wail of the theremin as Samir waved his hands like a mad conductor. Underneath it all was the click-click-whirr of the rotary dial as Felix randomly dialed numbers, connecting to dead lines, angry homeowners, and, once, a surprised-sounding pizza place. The boiling water burbled and popped, generating a low, stochastic gurgle.

Leo leaned into the mic. He didn’t speak of invasion or warning. He began to describe, in frantic, vivid detail, the dream he’d had when he was seven: flying over a city made of cheese, chased by a giant typewriter. He described the smell of his grandmother’s perfume—gardenia and mothballs. He recited the lyrics to a pop song he loved but had never understood. He confessed he’d stolen a comic book from a drugstore in 1994 and still felt guilty.

The immune from other pockets, those with transmitters and the will to use them, heard the Portland signal. In a bunker in Montana, a woman began broadcasting a continuous loop of a baby’s laughter. In a loft in Berlin, a man played a recording of a heated political argument between his grandparents, full of non-sequiturs and passionate, illogical insults. In a sailboat off the coast of Chile, a teenager transmitted the raw, unfiltered data of his own EEG, his brainwaves a storm of anxiety, hope, and hormonal chaos.

The two signals met in the ionosphere.

The beautiful, consuming aurora shuddered.

Where the chaotic human broadcast intersected with the pattern, the perfect light rippled. A tendril of emerald pulse stuttered, flashing not in its perfect rhythm, but in a syncopated, jazzy irregularity. A patch of cobalt frayed at the edges, bleeding into a messy, magnificent orange-pink, like a bruise or a sunset. The song in their bones wavered. For a second, it became a discordant clash, a symphony orchestra suddenly infected with a kazoo.

In the control room, the pressure lifted. The dust patterns on the floor swirled back into random piles.

“It’s working!” Samir yelled, a wild laugh breaking from his throat. He grabbed the theremin, producing a shriek that sounded like a cat being startled by its own tail.

But the entity was intelligent. It was predatory. It adjusted.

The aurora didn’t retreat. It focused. The vast, continent-wide shimmer contracted, coalescing into a brilliant, localized point directly above Portland. The light became a lens, and through it, they saw not stars, but the thing that had been Station Echo. It was no longer a satellite. It was a knot of luminous, organic geometry, a heart of pure pattern beating in the void, trailing filaments like neural dendrites. It was horrifying and sublime.

The carrier wave intensified, becoming a scalpel. The random noises from their transmitter began to… tidy up. The sobbing man’s cries began to harmonize with Beethoven. The boiling water’s burble settled into a regular, metronomic plink. The theremin’s wail smoothed into a pure, boring sine wave.

“It’s assimilating the noise!” Maya cried, frantically twisting knobs, trying to reintroduce distortion. “It’s turning our chaos into just another pattern!”

Leo felt the soft hand in his mind again, stronger now. It found the memory of his sister. Instead of erasing it, it began to perfect it. The memory of her laugh, once a loud, snorting, infectious sound that made her cover her mouth in embarrassment, became a gentle, melodic tinkle. The time she’d scraped her knee and he’d carried her home, her tears hot on his neck—the fear and pain were gently edited out, leaving only a serene image of sibling support. It was a violation more profound than theft. It was being curated.

He fought back, clinging to the true, messy memory. The snort. The snot bubble. The way she’d called him a “doofus” even as she cried. He pushed that raw, unedited feeling into the microphone.

“It’s not a perfect memory!” he screamed, his voice cracking. “She picked her nose! She hated my cooking! She was annoying! I loved her! I miss her!”

The transmitter, overloaded by his raw emotion, by the conflicting signals, by the entity’s counter-pressure, began to smoke. A capacitor popped with a sharp bang and the smell of burning plastic.

The beautiful light descended further, now close enough that individual strands, like threads of intelligent plasma, could be seen reaching down toward the city, toward their tower. They touched a skyscraper downtown. Where they made contact, the building didn’t explode. It reformed. Its glass and steel rippled, its unique architecture flowing into a shape of perfect, symmetrical beauty, devoid of character or history. It became a monument to nothing but its own geometric purity.

It was coming for them.

Felix, his eyes wide with a terror that was blessedly still his own, looked at the dying equipment, then at the descending light. “The signal… it’s not strong enough. Our noise is too small. It’s just… background static to that.”

Leo stared at the microphone in his hand, its metal warm. He thought of Aris, alone in his metal coffin, choosing to send a feeling instead of a fact. A feeling was harder to rewrite. What was the one feeling the pattern, for all its intelligence, could not comprehend? Not love, which could be idealized. Not hate, which could be rationalized.

It was the choice to be flawed. The stubborn, irrational celebration of the broken piece.

He had an idea. It was suicide.

“Maya,” he said, his voice suddenly calm. “Route my mic directly into the carrier wave amplifier. Bypass all filters. Maximum gain.”

“You’ll fry the circuit! You’ll fry yourself!”

“Route it,” he said, locking eyes with her. “And when I give the signal, I want you to plug in everything. The tapes, the phone, the water, the theremin. All of it, raw, at once. Create a feedback loop right here in the room.”

Understanding, and then a fierce, grieving pride, dawned on her face. She nodded, tears cutting tracks through the grime on her cheeks. Samir and Felix understood too. They didn’t argue. They simply moved to their stations, hands on their instruments.

Leo closed his eyes. He didn’t think of grand defiance. He thought of small, human things. The ache of a healing bone. The glorious, pointless variety of clouds before the entity came. The way every snowflake was supposedly unique, and how he’d never actually checked. He thought of his own heartbeat, irregular now with fear. A flawed rhythm.

He opened his eyes, looked at the light that was now filling the skylight, bleaching the color from the world.

“Now,” he said softly.

Maya threw the final switch.

Leo opened his mouth and did not speak. He let go. He poured every unprocessed, unfiltered sensation in his mind directly into the microphone—the terror, the love for his friends in this room, the memory of the stolen comic, the taste of lima beans, the physical pain in his knee from an old football injury, the joy of a perfect cup of coffee, the profound boredom of a Tuesday afternoon. It was a psychic scream of pure, contradictory self.

Samir slammed his hands on the theremin, producing a screech of protest. Felix dialed the phone over and over. Maya unleashed the tapes, the boiling water, the symphony, the sobbing.

The signals collided not in the atmosphere, but in the heart of the amplifier.

The equipment didn’t just smoke; it erupted. Circuit boards glowed, reels of tape spun wildly and snapped, spewing magnetic ribbon. The light pouring through the skylight flared, then stuttered violently.

In the control room, a new sound was born. It was the sound of the entity’s perfect carrier wave and humanity’s defiant noise giving birth to something else. It was neither order nor chaos. It was a shattering chord of such profound, impossible dissonance that it seemed to tear a seam in the local fabric of things. The descending tendril of light recoiled, not like a hand from a flame, but like a mind from an unthinkable thought.

High above, in the knot of luminous geometry that had been Station Echo, a dark spot appeared. A fissure. A crack of pure, silent not-pattern.

The beautiful aurora flickered across the entire planet, like a corrupted film reel. For one, global second, the pressure lifted. The song in a billion bones skipped a beat. In that silence, a thousand different, chaotic human sounds—a baby’s cry, a curse, a song sung out of tune, a scream of unedited grief—rushed in to fill the void.

Then, the light stabilized. It remained, hovering, a scar of terrible beauty across the sky.

But it was no longer advancing.

In the ruined control room, the air acrid with ozone and burnt wiring, Leo slumped against the console, blood trickling from his nose and ears. The others were similarly broken, breathing in ragged gasps. They were alive. The world, for now, was still theirs.

Outside, the entity hung in orbit, a silent, wounded moon. The war was not over. It had not been driven back. But it had been halted. It had been shown a variable it could not solve, a feeling it could not digest: the glorious, irrational will to be imperfect.

The crack in its light was small, but it was there. And in that crack, a new signal was born—not of conquest, but of a terrible, uncertain stalemate. The silent question now hanging in the air, in the static between stations, was simple: What does a hungry universe do when its food suddenly, inexplicably, begins to fight back?
