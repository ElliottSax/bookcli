The air in the auxiliary control booth tasted of copper and burnt almonds, a noxious odor that seeped into Aris’s pores. Fear had its own metallic tang, sharp against the acrid stench of the station’s fire suppressant. His hands, slick with a cold sweat, moved across the secondary engineering console with a precision that defied the tremor in his fingers. The main systems were gone, singing the entity’s hymn in a chorus of distorted data. But here, in this forgotten closet, a sliver of the old Station Echo still flickered. A diagnostic terminal, its screen a monochrome green sanctuary from the pulsing, meat-colored light now throbbing through the portholes, cast a sickly glow on the walls.

Only the terminal’s hum and the tortured creak of twisted metal broke the silence. Aris’s heart hammered against his ribs. He’d torn the voice-recorder from his belt and pried it open with a screwdriver, the metal scraping against plastic. Inside lay a simple memory chip for log backups, a tiny, unassuming thing. To it, he fed a symphony of chaos.

“It can’t be a logical virus,” he muttered to the empty room. “It eats logic. It turns sequence into scripture.” The words dissolved into the static-charged air. So he built nonsense, coding from instinct, from the raw fear that had been his companion since the lights first bled. He sampled the shriek of feedback from a dead comms channel, stretched it thin, and spliced it with the stuttering click of a Geiger counter gone mad. The sound seared into his brain, a cacophony of pain and terror.

He pulled raw data from the corrupted crew manifests, jumbling service numbers with DNA sequences until they meant nothing. The codes blurred on the screen, a meaningless jumble of letters and numbers that shifted and writhed. He wrote a simple command—TERMINATE TRANSMISSION SOURCE—and then broke it, inverting the code, folding it back on itself, and burying it in layers of screaming audio static. The result was a digital shiv, a spike of pure, destructive irrationality. A poison pill for the mind.

The station twisted around him, walls pulsing with a malevolent life. The air chilled; shadows deepened into dark, twisted things that moved of their own accord. A pressure built behind his eyes, the sensation of unseen observation. He slid the chip into a hardened data-spike casing, a tool for manual overrides. It sat heavy in his palm, not like metal, but like a piece of the void made solid.

As his fist closed around it, Station Echo shifted. A deep, internal reorientation, like a great animal feeling a thorn prick its skin. The low hum filling Echo changed pitch, turning into a question, then a warning growl. The green light of his terminal flickered. For one second, the symbols on the screen rearranged into a single, looping phrase: YOU ARE THE SIGNAL. Aris ripped the spike from the port. The phrase vanished, leaving a cold unease in its wake.

The booth’s door, which he’d wedged shut with a chair, groaned. Not at the hinges—the polymer of the door itself tightened, a muscle flexing, and pushed the chair out with a wet, tearing sound. It clattered to the deck, which was no longer gridded metal, but a surface glistening with something dark and wet. Time for hiding was over. The station knew.

Aris pushed the door open. A warm, golden light spilled out, a benediction from a twisted god. The Station Echo beyond was unrecognizable. Sterile white plating had vanished, replaced by a lattice of thick, ropy tendrils like fossilized veins, pulsing with a slow, heavy rhythm. Between them, the walls were membranous, transparent, the skin of some vast, alien creature. The air hung thick with ozone and the ghost of burned circuitry.

He stepped out. The station loomed, its twisted architecture a physical manifestation of every buried fear. He had to move. To find a way to stop the entity before it consumed the last flicker of what remained. But the sight around him whispered a darker truth: the station was already gone. He was just a relic, moving through the corpse.

The darkness clung to him, a suffocating shroud. Aris drew a breath, the air cold and metallic in his lungs, and moved forward into the heart of the station. The entity would stop at nothing to claim him, to add his mind to its collection. He had no other path.

As he walked, the station shifted and turned around him, walls pulsing. The air grew colder. Shadows deepened, twisting into shapes that slithered just at the edge of vision. The pressure of being watched intensified, a needle-point focus between his shoulder blades. He was getting close.

The silence was absolute, broken only by the wet, rhythmic pulse of the tendrils. Aris’s heart thudded against his sternum, every sense screaming. It was only a matter of time.

He turned a corner.

It waited.

A mass of pulsing tendrils and dark, wet flesh filled the corridor, its form studded with points of cold, otherworldly light that served as eyes. Aris’s blood turned to ice. He stared into the face of a madness that had devoured a station.

But his hand tightened around the data-spike. He would not back down.

The entity loomed, its form swelling, tendrils uncoiling like serpents. Aris planted his feet, the spike’s casing cool against his palm.

The tendrils snaked toward him, swift and silent.

Aris raised his hand, the metal glinting in the sickly golden light. He had one shot. A poison pill for a poisoned mind.

The tendrils hesitated, hovering inches from his face. The lights within the flesh pulsed, a slow, curious rhythm.

Then they surged forward.

Aris drove the spike into the nearest tendril.

The station screamed.
