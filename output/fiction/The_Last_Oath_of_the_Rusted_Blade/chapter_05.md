Chapter 5: Brothers in Iron

Chapter 5: Brothers in Iron

The Ashen Wastes didn’t end; they just changed their mind. The endless grey plains of dust and brittle stone fractured into a canyon land of jagged, wine-dark rock. The wind, a constant mourner on the flats, became a shrieking poltergeist here, funneled through narrow cuts, whipping up stinging spirals of grit. It was in one such cut, a passage so narrow Kael and Anya had to move single-file, that the ambush was sprung.

There was no warning shout, no dramatic challenge. Just the sudden, lethal thwip of a crossbow bolt. It sparked off the rock an inch from Kael’s face, showering him with stinging fragments. Instinct, older than thought, took over. He didn’t throw himself down; he shoved Anya back against the canyon wall and pressed himself beside her, his rusted notched blade already in his hand.

“Company,” he growled, the word tasting of ash and old iron.

They came not from ahead, but from above. Silhouettes against the bruised purple sky, five figures rappelled down the canyon walls with the grim efficiency of spiders. They landed in a loose half-circle, blocking the narrow passage forward. Their armour was not the gleaming plate of storybooks, but functional brigandine, scarred leather, and mail shirts, each piece bearing the faint, acid-etched symbol of a broken chain on the left pauldron. The Iron Covenant.

Kael’s gut tightened into a cold, familiar knot.

The man at the centre of the line stepped forward, pushing up his visor. His face was all hard planes and weathered skin, a few years younger than Kael’s but carved by the same harsh tools. A long, pale scar bisected his right eyebrow, a souvenir from a bandit camp near the Salt Marches. Valen. His eyes, the colour of a winter sky, held no surprise, only a weary resolve.

“Kael,” Valen said. His voice was flat, carrying over the moaning wind. “You’re a hard man to find in a wasteland.”

“Trying to be,” Kael replied, his own voice a low rasp. He kept his body angled, a frail shield between the mercenaries and Anya. He could feel her trembling behind him, not with fear, he realized, but with a furious, focused energy.

“You look like shit, brother,” Valen said, his gaze flicking over Kael’s worn gear, lingering on the pitiful rust-eaten sword. “The freelancer life doesn’t suit you.”

“It has its moments. What’s the Covenant’s business here? Scavenging?”

“Contract,” Valen said simply. He nodded toward Anya. “The Sorcerer-King of Tel Varia wants the book. And the bearer. Alive. Pay is… significant. Enough to retire.”

A hollow laugh escaped Kael. “Retire? Since when does the Covenant retire? We die in ditches, Valen. That’s the pact.”

“Pacts change.” Valen’s jaw worked. He glanced at his four companions—stony-faced professionals, hands resting on weapon hilts. Kael recognized two of them: Bor, a hulking northerner with a hammer, and Lyna, a sharp-eyed woman with a brace of throwing knives on her chest. They didn’t meet his gaze. “The offer isn’t just for the contract,” Valen continued, taking another step. The distance between them was now ten paces. Killing ground. “It’s for you. Hand over the nun, come back with us. Your share is waiting. The past is past.”

The words hung in the gritty air. Kael saw not the canyon, but the smoky interior of the Griffon’s Rest, years ago. Valen, young and bleeding from a gut wound, Kael dragging him through a burning village. Valen, sharing his last waterskin on the Sunscorched Road. Brothers in iron, they’d called themselves, a bond forged in blood and survival, stronger than family because it was chosen.

“The past,” Kael repeated softly. He felt Anya’s hand press lightly against his back, a tiny point of warmth. He thought of her stubborn hope in the dead monastery, her quiet strength as she deciphered her cursed book. A simple job. A last oath. “You’re asking me to break an oath, Valen.”

“I’m asking you to honour an older one!” Valen’s composure cracked, a flash of the hot-tempered lieutenant he’d been. “To the Covenant! To the men and women who bled with you! Who buried friends for you! This… this vagabond life, this rust you carry… it’s beneath you. Come home.”

The word home was a masterstroke. It struck a chord so deep and rusted within Kael it vibrated with a painful hum. The Covenant had been his home. His only home. The memory of camaraderie, of purpose, of watching each other’s backs in a world that wanted them dead, washed over him with the force of a physical blow. He saw Bor give an almost imperceptible nod. Lyna’s expression softened for a fleeting second.

He lowered his blade a fraction. “Valen…”

“They have families, Kael,” Valen pressed, voice dropping, intimate, pleading. “Bor’s got a daughter he’s never seen. Lyna’s brother needs a healer’s touch we can’t afford. This pay… it fixes things. It saves lives. Our lives. Just hand her over.”

Kael looked back at Anya. Her face was pale, smudged with dust, but her eyes were fierce. She didn’t beg. She didn’t speak. She just looked at him, and in her gaze, he didn’t see a payday or a contract. He saw the flickering candle in the dark, the whispered prayer over a dying man, the weight of a world she was trying to save from a doom she barely understood. A world that had given him nothing but scars and a rusted blade.

He saw the true choice. Not between an old friend and a new employer. Between the broken family he’d left and the broken future she carried.

With a sound like a sigh, Kael raised his sword again. The moment shattered.

“I can’t.”

The grief that washed over Valen’s face was more terrible than any anger. It was the look of a man watching his last bridge burn. “Then you die with her.”

Valen didn’t shout the order. He simply moved. His sword, a well-kept, practical arming sword, cleared its scabbard with a soft ring. The others followed as one.

The canyon exploded into violence.

Kael met Valen’s first overhead chop, not with a block, but with a desperate deflection, guiding the blow to slam into the ground beside him. The impact jarred up his arm, reminding him brutally of the difference between steel and rust. He was instantly on the back foot. Valen knew his style, every old trick, every favoured combo. Kael fought defensively, a frantic dance of parries and dodges, his rusted blade screeching in protest each time it met true metal.

To his side, Anya was not idle. As a lanky mercenary with a short spear lunged for her, she didn’t cower. She swung the heavy, book-filled satchel like a flail. It connected with the man’s helmet with a dull clang, staggering him. She followed by hurling a handful of the fine, blinding ash from the canyon floor into the face of another. It was not warfare, but it was effective disruption.

But they were professionals. Bor, the giant, swung his warhammer in a wide, controlled arc, forcing Kael to leap back against the rock wall. Lyna’s knife hissed past his ear, drawing a line of fire across his cheek.

“Don’t kill him!” Valen roared, battering at Kael’s guard. “Subdue him!”

Kael’s world narrowed to the clash of steel, the grunt of effort, the smell of his own sweat and blood. He was a ghost fighting the living, his skills etched in memory but his body and tools failing. A hard parry from Valen sent a jarring crack through his rusted blade; a new, deeper notch appeared near the hilt. Next blow would snap it.

He needed space. A miracle.

Anya provided it. Pressed against the wall, she had been fumbling in her robes. Now, she pulled out a small, smooth stone from the automaton’s wreckage—a leftover power core, still faintly glowing. With a prayer shouted not in fear, but in command, she hurled it at the canyon floor between them and the mercenaries.

It didn’t explode. It activated.

A wave of concussive force, silent and invisible, erupted from the stone. It didn’t shatter rock, but it hit the mercenaries like a wall of solid air. Bor stumbled, his hammer dropping. Lyna was thrown off her feet. Valen braced, but was driven back a step, his boots scraping on stone.

The kinetic pulse also struck the canyon wall beside Kael. With a sound like a giant’s spine cracking, a fissure opened in the wine-dark rock—a black, narrow seam.

“Kael!” Anya screamed.

He didn’t hesitate. He grabbed her arm and shoved her into the fissure, diving in after her just as Valen recovered and lunged. The captain’s sword-tip scraped against Kael’s boot heel as the darkness swallowed them.

They fell, not down, but through. The fissure was not a crack, but an entrance. They tumbled into a space that swallowed sound and light. The shouts from outside became muffled, then silent. They landed in a heap on a surface that was not rock, but something smooth and slightly yielding. A faint, ambient light began to grow, emanating from the very air.

Kael pushed himself up, gasping. They were in a cavern, but unlike any natural formation. The walls, floor, and high ceiling were composed of immense, interlocking crystals. They were deep purple at the base, fading to a pale, luminous amethyst at their tips. The light pulsed softly, like a slow heartbeat, casting everything in eerie, shifting violet shadows. The air was cool, dry, and carried a faint, clean scent of ozone and stone.

“By all the saints,” Anya whispered, staring in awe.

Kael had no time for awe. He scrambled to the fissure entrance, now a jagged tear of ordinary darkness in the magnificent crystal wall. He could hear voices, angry and echoing, from the canyon beyond.

“—find another way in! They can’t have gone far!”

“Captain, the rock is solid here, no other cracks!”

“Then we find the exit! Fan out! They’re in the crystal caves of The Blighted Wastes—they have to come out somewhere!”

Kael turned from the entrance. The cavern was vast, with several tunnel-like passages leading away, each formed from the same glowing crystal. It was a labyrinth. A beautiful, deadly labyrinth.

Anya was already on her feet, clutching her satchel. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know it would do that.”

“It bought us time,” Kael said, wiping blood from his cheek. He looked at his sword. The new notch was deep, the metal around it stress-whitened. It was a breath away from breaking. He sheathed it, the gesture feeling like a funeral rite. “We need to move. They’ll find a way in.”

They chose a passage at random, their footsteps making no sound on the smooth crystal. The pulsing light played tricks on the eyes, making distances hard to judge. The silence was absolute, profound, pressing in on their ears after the chaos of the fight.

After what felt like an hour of silent, desperate travel, they paused in a small chamber where the crystals formed a natural dome. Kael leaned against a wall, his breath coming hard. The adrenaline was fading, leaving behind the ache of his muscles and a deeper, more profound ache in his chest.

“He was your friend,” Anya said softly. It wasn’t a question.

“He was my brother.” The words were ash in his mouth. “The Covenant… it was all I had. They were my family when I had none.”

“And you chose me.” Her voice was full of a wonder that held no triumph, only a heavy gratitude.

“I chose an oath,” he corrected, but it was a weak distinction. He had chosen her oath. Her mission. The look on Valen’s face haunted him. The grief, the betrayal. For what? For a rusted blade and a nun with a death wish?

He slid down the crystal wall to sit. “He said the pay could save them. Fix their lives.”

“The Sorcerer-King of Tel Varia is a leech who drains the life from his own lands to fuel his immortality rituals,” Anya said, her voice hardening. “His ‘pay’ is always stained. Whatever he promised them, it is a lie. He doesn’t buy loyalty; he entraps it.”

Kael nodded, too weary to argue. He believed her. But understanding the trap didn’t free the men caught in it.

They rested for only a few minutes before a new sound echoed through the crystalline corridors. Not footsteps. A voice, amplified and distorted by the strange acoustics, bouncing off a thousand facets. It was Valen’s voice, filled with a raw, desperate fury that cut through the serene beauty of the caves.

“KAEL! I know you can hear me! You think you’re noble? You think you’re redeeming your precious soul?”

The words rolled around them, coming from everywhere and nowhere. Anya stiffened. Kael pushed himself to his feet, hand going to his broken sword.

“You left us to rot!” Valen’s shout echoed. “And now you judge us for taking the only hand that reached down to pull us out of the shit? You have no idea what you’ve done!”

Kael remained silent, his jaw clenched. Arguing would give away their position.

The echoing voice dropped, then, not in volume, but in pitch. The fury bled out, replaced by a haunting, hollow despair that was infinitely worse.

“The Sorcerer-King has our souls bound, brother!”

The words landed like a physical blow. Kael felt the blood drain from his face.

“The contract was signed in blood and shadow,” Valen’s voice wept through the crystal. “Our names on his ledger. Our lives forfeit if we fail. It’s not gold he holds over us, Kael. It’s our essence. We have no choice! None!”

The confession hung in the luminous air, a truth more terrible than any insult. They weren’t just hired swords. They were slaves. Soul-bound. Failure meant not just no pay, but annihilation, or worse, an eternity of servitude beyond death. Valen’s relentless pursuit, his willingness to cut down an old brother… it wasn’t greed. It was survival of the most fundamental kind.

“He’s telling the truth,” Anya breathed, horror-struck. “Tel Varian soul-binding… I’ve read of it. It’s a dark, permanent magic. They’re not just mercenaries. They’re condemned men.”

Valen’s final shout came then, not filled with rage, but with a bleak, heartbreaking finality that echoed long after the sound faded.

“So I will find you, Kael! I will take the nun and the book! Because I have to! And if I have to send your soul to the abyss to do it… know that I will weep for you as I do it! We are all damned here! The only choice is how!”

Silence returned, deeper and more oppressive than before.

Kael stared into the pulsing violet light of the crystals, seeing not their beauty, but a prison. Valen and the Covenant weren’t the hunters. They were the hunted, whipped forward by a chain hooked into their very souls. And he, Kael, by refusing, by holding to his last pathetic oath, had just become the quarry they were forced to destroy to save themselves.

He had fought them as enemies. Now he understood they were victims. And the next time they crossed blades, it wouldn’t be a skirmish. It would be an execution, performed by friends who had no other way to stay alive.

“We have to move,” he said, his voice utterly toneless. “And we have to find a way out of this labyrinth before he does.”

But the real hook was already set, buried deep in his heart. His brother was damned. And to keep his oath, Kael might have to send him to his eternal punishment.
