Chapter 2: Into the Bleaching Sands

The Ashen Wastes did not welcome. They consumed.
This truth revealed itself within the first hour. A white, searing coin of a sun leached all moisture from the sky, scraping Kael’s eyes dry with every blink. Underfoot, the ground whispered with a sinister dryness—not sand, but a fine, granular ash. It clung to his worn boots, the frayed hem of his cloak, the sweat on his neck, painting the world in monochrome grey and bone-white. Each breath scraped the throat with the taste of cinders and old salt.
Five paces behind Sister Anya, a distance both practical and symbolic, Kael matched her relentless, placid determination. Her simple robes had already dusted to the wasteland’s hue. The only colour on her was the worn leather satchel and the strange, thick book bound to her belt with braided horsehair.
“Keep your scarf over your mouth,” came her muffled voice through the linen wrap. “Last night’s ash-storm stirred phantoms in the dust. Inhale too deeply, and you’ll be coughing blood by noon.”

Adjusting the rag across his face, Kael grunted. Her warnings at the abbey had seemed like monastic overcaution. He was wrong. This place was a corpse of a land, every element dedicated to ensuring they joined it.
Again, his hand drifted to the rusted longsword on his back. The familiar weight hung there, inert and dead—a mockery. His hand fell instead to the plain, serviceable dagger at his hip. This, at least, was just steel. It would not fail him.
“Scholar,” he rasped, ash already gritting between his teeth. “You said three days to the Canite outpost. In this? We’ll be lucky to make ten miles before sunset.”

Anya didn’t turn. “The land remembers old roads, Kael of no-house. One must simply know how to look.”

Kneeling, she brushed away a layer of ash with a reverent hand. Beneath lay not stone, but a shard of something glossy and black, threaded with veins of sickly green. Unmistakably worked—an edge, a curve. Not human.
“Glass-stone,” Anya murmured, more to herself than to him. “From the deep forges of the Svart. Laid here when the world was younger and wetter.” Standing, she wiped her fingers on her robe. “We follow this vein. It will lead us true.”

“You’re navigating by buried elf-ruins?” Disbelief sharpened his words.
“I am navigating by the last testimony of a world before the Bleaching.” Calmly, she resumed walking.
He followed, a fresh unease coiling in his gut. This was no simple pilgrimage to a remote shrine. Who was this woman, who prayed to the Twin Saints but could read the bones of a dead, non-human empire?
With slow, sadistic patience, the wastes unfolded their horrors. Skeletal trees, petrified into twisted, blackened claws, reached for the bleached sky. A gust of wind revealed the half-buried ribcage of some colossal beast, its bones porous and light as pumice stone. Over everything lay a vast, smothering silence, broken only by the sigh of ash and the crunch of their footsteps.
Then the whispers began.
At first, just a faint, skittering sound, like pebbles dragged over stone. He stopped, hand on his dagger. Anya paused, head cocked.
“Do you hear–” he began.
“Down!” Her shout was not fear, but clear command.
He dropped. Something whistled over his head—a blurred, greyish armature that snapped shut on empty air with a sound like breaking slate. Rolling, ash filling his eyes and mouth, he came up facing the thing.
A nightmare of chitin and dust. The size of a large hound, its segmented, ash-coloured carapace blended perfectly with the ground. A barbed tail, dripping viscous, clear fluid, arched over its back. Its eyes were clusters of black, lightless orbs. Not one, but three of them, emerging from shallow burrows.
Ash-scorpions. Tales spoke of desert horrors that hunted in packs, their venom a paralytic that left prey conscious while they fed.
“Don’t let the tail touch you!” Anya called, backing toward a larger petrified tree. “Their underbelly, at the segment joints, is soft!”

*Perfect. I’ll be sure to ask it to roll over.*

The first scorpion scuttled forward with alarming speed. Dancing back, his boots slipped in the ash. He was a swordsman, or had been. This close-quarters dance with a dagger against multiple foes was a butcher’s game, not a knight’s. The rusted blade on his back useless anchor.
A tail stabbed down at his thigh. Pivoting, he took the barb across his leather greave instead of flesh. The impact numbed his leg. He lunged, not for the body, but for the leading leg, hacking with his dagger. The chitin was tougher than it looked; the blade bit but didn’t sever. The scorpion recoiled with a hiss like steam.
Another arrived from his blind side. The tail poised to strike, but he was off-balance. A blur of grey robe shot past him. Anya, moving with a nun’s calm precision, swung her heavy, waxed-leather water-skin in a solid arc. It connected with the scorpion’s head in a dull *thwack*. The creature staggered.
“The joint behind the third leg!”

He didn’t question. Throwing himself forward, under the lashing tail of the first scorpion, he drove his dagger up into the soft, pale membrane where leg met body. It was like puncturing a wineskin. Hot ichor, reeking of ammonia, sprayed over his hand. The creature shrieked, a horrifyingly organic sound, and collapsed, legs twitching.he second scorpion, the one Anya had stunned, was recovering. The third closed in from behind her. Kael scrambled up, his burned hand screaming, ash in his eyes. He was vulnerable, slow. The ghost of the warrior he had been screamed in frustration at the limits of the man he was.
“Anya, behind you!”

She turned, but not to run. She dropped her water-skin and reached into the satchel at her side. Her hand came out clutching a handful of coarse, reddish powder. She spat onto it, muttered a single, guttural word that sounded nothing like a prayer, and flung it into the face of the advancing scorpion.
The powder didn’t explode. It hissed, and where it touched the creature’s damp maw and eye-clusters, the chitin smoked and sizzled. The scorpion recoiled, thrashing in blind agony.
Kael used the distraction. He feinted toward the wounded third scorpion, then changed direction and kicked a great plume of ash into the face of the second. As it flinched, he dove, ignoring the pain in his hand, and found the same soft joint. Two quick, brutal stabs. The creature shuddered and went still.
The third, its face melting from Anya’s alchemy, burrowed frantically into the ash and disappeared.
Silence rushed back in, louder than before. Kael knelt in the grey dust, chest heaving, the coppery taste of fear and ash thick in his mouth. His dagger hand was coated in sticky, stinging ichor. He was panting, his muscles trembling with exhausted adrenaline. He looked at the two dead monsters, then at Anya.
She was calmly retrieving her water-skin, checking it for punctures. Her composure was infuriating. And vital.
“Saltpeter, quicklime, and a blessing of concentrated vinegar,” she said, as if reading his stare. “The old texts call it ‘Dragon’s Sneeze.’ Effective against carapaced nuisances.”

“You’re no ordinary sister,” Kael gasped, wiping his blade clean on the ash.
“And you are no ordinary drunk,” she replied, her eyes meeting his. They held a new, assessing light. “A drunk would be dead. You adapted. You listened.” She nodded at his hand. “The ichor is caustic. Wash it with water, now. Use sparingly.”

He did as he was told, pouring a precious trickle from his own skin over the burning skin. The water turned milky and foul. “You knew what they were. You knew where to strike.”

“The Compendium of Bleached Life by Historian-Cantor Ferric,” she replied, patting the book at her side. “Knowledge is a weapon, Kael. Sometimes the only one that doesn’t break.”

The words struck him with the force of a physical blow. He glanced away, toward the endless, hungry wastes. The rusted blade on his back appeared to grow colder.
They made camp that night in the lee of a wind-sculpted ash-dune. A fire was impossible—nothing to burn but more ash. They ate hard travel bread and strips of salted meat, the silence between them now a shared thing, forged in the skirmish.
Anya took out her book. Not to read, but to pray. She held it in her lap, her hands resting on its cover, and chant softly in Low Liturgical. Kael recognized fragments—pleas for guidance, verses on perseverance. Then, her voice dropping to a whisper, he caught it.
“…and spare us the touch of the Unmaking, that which bleaches the soul as the sun bleaches the stone…”

The Unmaking. The word hung in the frigid air. It wasn’t part of any canonical prayer he’d ever heard. It sounded less like a spiritual concept and more like a… a force. A disease.
He didn’t ask. Some doors, once opened, couldn’t be closed. He pretended to sleep, watching through slitted eyes as she finished her devotions and sat staring into the dark, her face etched with a worry that seemed older than her years.
The second day was a trial of thirst and relentless, bleaching light. Anya’s “road” of glass-stone shards grew more frequent, often leading them on winding paths that seemed illogical but consistently avoided the soft, sucking ash-pits that she pointed out with grim certainty.
Near what passed for midday, they crested a rise, and the land fell away before them into a shallow, vast basin.
And there, half-swallowed by the drifting dunes, lay the bones of a city.
It was not human. The arches were too low, the proportions all wrong, made for a shorter, stockier folk. The buildings were carved from the same black glass-stone, now cracked and clouded by ages of scouring ash. Towers had melted like candles, flowing into bizarre, organic shapes. Empty windows stared like the eye-sockets of a giant skull. Feelings of immense, melancholy age hung over it, a whisper of a time when this waste had been alive.
“The Svart,” Anya breathed, her scholarly detachment gone, replaced by pure, reverent awe. “A way-station, perhaps. Or a shrine-city. The texts spoke of them, but to see one…”

She started down the slope toward it, drawn like a moth to a flame.
“Sister,” Kael warned, his hand on his dagger. “If anything lives in this waste, it lives there.”

“Some truths only live in such places,” she said, not stopping.
Cursing under his breath, he followed. The silence within the ruins was deeper, a held breath. The ash muffled their steps. They passed under a sagging archway, into a central plaza. A shattered obelisk lay on its side, covered in intricate, spiralling glyphs that made Kael’s head ache to look at.
Anya approached it, her fingers hovering over the carvings. “Their language was one of geometry and resonance. They wrote in stone, but sang in light…”

As she spoke, a change occurred.
A soft, blue glow emanated from her satchel.
Kael froze. “Anya. Your bag.”

She looked down, confusion turning to shock. She slowly unbuckled the flap and drew out her holy book. The plain leather cover was pulsing with a gentle, rhythmic, cerulean light. Thump… thump… Like a slow, steady heartbeat. The light seeped from the edges of the cover, illuminating the fine grain of the leather, the worn stitching.
“What in the cold hells is that?” Kael whispered, his voice tight.
Anya clutched the book to her chest, the light casting her face in eerie, underwater shadows. Her eyes were wide, not with fear, but with something akin to hunger, or vindication. “It… recognizes. The resonance. The memory in the stone…”

“That’s no prayer book,” Ka answered, taking a step back. The feeling of unease was now a cold flood in his veins. “What are you carrying? What is ‘the Unmaking’?”

She tore her gaze from the glowing book andgazedd at him. The pious, determined sister was still there, but beneath it, he saw a fanatic’s flame. “It is the reason we are here, Kael. The reason I needed a man who knows what it is to be broken, and to fight on anyway.” She looked around at the dead, non-human city. “This… this is simply a symptom. A scar. Our destination is the wound.”

The book’s pulsto slow, the light fading. But the impression of that steady, unnatural heartbeat was seared into Kael’s vision. He had signed on to escort a nun. He was in the deep wastes with a woman carrying a heartbeat in a book, following the roads of a dead empire, fleeing a object she called the Unmaking.
The rusted blade on his back felt, for the first time in years, not like a dead weight.
It like a warning.
He peered from Anya’s resolved face to the dark, waiting mouths of the Svart ruins around them. The journey was no longer into the Bleaching Sands.
It was into a mystery that glowed with a sick, holy light, and he was now bound to it, not by coin, but by the grim understanding that he had already stepped into a current that would pull him under if he tried to turn back.
“We move,” he said, his voice harder than the glass-stone around them. “Now. Before whatever your book is talking to decides to talk back.”

He turned and led the way out of the plaza, not waiting to see if she followed. He could feel the ghostly pulse of the light against his back, a new and terrible lodestar in the bleaching dark.
