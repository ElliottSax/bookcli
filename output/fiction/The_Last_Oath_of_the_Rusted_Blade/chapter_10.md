The guardian's helmeted head inclined, its blue eyes burning with an unyielding intensity. "The fracture," it repeated, its voice like the grinding of stones. "Show me the fracture."

Kael's gaze dropped to the scabbarded blade on the floor, the weight of his memories crushing him. He had carried the shame of that day for a decade, the sting of his failure to live up to his own code. To expose it now like laying bare his soul.
Anya's hand closed around his wrist, a gentle pressure that anchored him to the present. "Kael," she whispered, her voice a lifeline in the darkness.
He took a deep breath, the air burning in his lungs. He unstrapped Oathkeeper, the scabbard creaking as he laid it on the dusty floor. The blade appeared to sag, its once-majestic form now a dull, pitted brown. Rust had claimed it, as if a century of neglect had compressed into a few hours of terrible choice.
The memory surged, not as a ghost, but as a full-bodied assault. He familiar, cold focus settle over him, the weight of his warband's expectations bearing down. He saw the rain-soaked streets of Harrow's Gate, the griffin-head gargoyles on the magistrate's keep, the slick black mirrors of the cobbles.
He rush of adrenaline as he infiltrated the keep, his brothers Loras and Varek at his flanks. The plan was clean, a mercenary's poetry. Up the servant's stair, into the private chambers, a quick kill, out through the granary chute. But then the world exploded.
The sound of the landslide still echoed in his mind, the screams of the city's lower quarters, the tidal wave of mud, rock, and splintered homes. He saw the flash of memory: his own village, a different kind of ruin, different screams. The oath he'd sworn when he first lifted a blade not for coin, but to stand between the helpless and the storm.
He weight of his decision, the crack in the weapon in his hand. Not a physical crack, but a spiritual one. Its light guttered, and he knew he could never go back to being the Captain of the Iron Covenant. He was an oathbreaker, the Rusted Blade.
The memory released him, leaving him gasping in the present stillness. His cheeks were wet, and he feelings of shame wash over him. He had not wept then; he had no tears left for the mud of Harrow's Gate. But recounting it to this ancient judge, with Anya bearing witness, stripped him raw.
"I broke my oath," he said, the words tasting of ash. "I broke my word. I broke myself."

The guardian's helmeted head inclined, its blue eyes burning with an unyielding intensity. "The vault answers only to stone," it repeated. "His stone." The helmeted head inclined toward Kael. "Show me the stone."

As he lifted the blade, the rusto deepen, the pitted brown becoming a dull, lifeless grey. He weight of his failure, the sting of his shame. He was no longer the Captain of the Iron Covenant. He was an oathbreaker, the Rusted Blade.
The guardian's helmeted head inclined, its blue eyes burning with an unyielding intensity. "The stone," it repeated. "Show me the stone."

Kael's gaze met the guardian's, and he knew what he had to do. He unsheathed Oathkeeper, the blade glinting in the dim light of the chamber. The rust seemed appeared to, the pitted brown becoming a dull, lifeless grey. He weight of his failure, the sting of his shame.
But as he looked at the blade, he saw something else. He saw a glimmer of light, a spark of hope. He saw the possibility of redemption, of forgiveness. He saw the stone, the crack in the stone that was his soul.
