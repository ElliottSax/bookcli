Chapter 1: The Rust and the Coin

The smell of the Guttering Candle was a familiar beast—a stew of sour ale, old sweat, boiled cabbage, and the underlying, ever-present tang of despair. With his back to the wall, Kael’s spine had curved to fit the damp stone. Before him sat a tankard of something brown and a plate of congealed fat that might once have been stew. Calloused and scarred, his hands rested on the table. One curled loosely around the tankard; the other lay, always, on the leather-bound hilt of the sword at his side. Oathkeeper. The name was a joke now, a bitter pill on the back of his tongue. It hadn’t been drawn in three years. Not since the Siege of Greywall. Not since the screaming and the silence that followed. Rust had fused the blade fast in its scabbard, a single, ugly entity of neglect. Fine-tooled leather, worn but of obvious quality, sheathed it—a stark contrast to the rest of him. His tunic was patched, his boots let in the damp, and the cloak he’d once worn with pride was now just a grey rag against the chill.

He didn’t need to look up to know they’d entered. The tavern’s raucous noise dipped, then resumed with a new, sharper edge. Well-oiled, heavy boots thudded on the flagstones. Good mail clinked, and the scent of metal polish and ambition cut through the murk. A splash of colour and threat: crimson sashes across polished breastplates, the badge of the Iron Covenant—a clenched fist holding a broken chain—gleaming on their shoulders.

Borin led them, his beard trimmed to a sharp point, his eyes the colour of flint. Once a squad-leader under Kael, now a captain. He made a show of scanning the room, his gaze sliding over Kael once, then snapping back with theatrical surprise.

“Gods below,” Borin’s voice cut through the din, too loud, too cheerful. “Is that a ghost in the corner, or just the stink of failure?”

Kael took a slow drink of the piss-warm ale.

Swaggering over, Borin leaned on the table, his two young, hard-faced companions flanking him. They looked at Kael like something scraped off their boots. The wood creaked. “Captain Kael,” Borin said. “Or is it just Kael now? Heard you sold the title with your armour. Got a good price for the scrap, I hope.”

One of the young ones sniggered. Kael’s thumb rubbed a familiar, rust-crusted groove on Oathkeeper’s crossguard.

“I’m drinking, Borin.” The words were a gravel-road whisper, unused.

“What, this?” Borin flicked a finger at Kael’s tankard, sending a wave of foul liquid sloshing over the rim. “This isn’t drinking. This is drowning. Slowly. Pathetically.” He straightened, his face hardening. “We’ve a contract. South. Bandit cleansing. Good silver. The kind you used to count without thinking.” Leaning in again, his voice dropped to a venomous hiss only Kael could hear. “They asked about you at the chapter-house. I told them the truth. Kael of Greywall is dead. All that’s left is the rust.”

The words hung in the air, sharper than any blade, hooking into the old, numb places. For a fractured second, the rain-slicked walls of Greywall replaced the tavern, the silence where rallying cries should have been. The weight of the key in his hand, the one that opened the sally port. A trade. A city for a life. His oath, for hers.

He blinked. Borin was smiling, a thin, cruel thing. “Enjoy your swill.”

They turned, their laughter a physical blow against Kael’s back. He didn’t watch them go, staring instead at the puddle of ale on the table where a fat fly struggled. His hand tightened on Oathkeeper’s hilt. A small, secret pull—a test, a penance performed a dozen times a day. The blade didn’t budge. Just dead weight, a millstone lashed to his soul. The rust held fast, a judgement more final than any court’s.

He was about to signal for another drink, to truly begin the night’s drowning, when a different shadow fell across his table. Not the bulky, aggressive shadow of mercenary plate, but something softer, smaller. A hood of coarse, undyed wool.

“Kael of the Iron Covenant?” A woman’s voice, low and measured, without mockery.

He looked up slowly. She pushed back her hood, revealing a severe, intelligent face, younger than expected—perhaps in her late twenties. Dark brown hair was braided tightly and pinned close to her scalp. Eyes the colour of wet slate held his without flinching. Travel-stained robes of a religious order covered her, but no holy symbols hung around her neck. Instead, a leather satchel bulging with books and scroll-cases was slung across her body. A pilgrim, maybe. But pilgrims didn’t seek out broken men in the Guttering Candle.

“There is no Kael of the Iron Covenant here,” he said, turning back to his tankard.

“I see.” She didn’t leave, gesturing to the empty bench opposite. “May I?”

“Suit yourself.”

She sat with a rustle of wool, placing clean, ink-stained hands flat on the table. A scholar’s hands. “My name is Sister Anya, of the Order of the Veiled Map.”

Kael grunted. Cartographer-nuns, chroniclers, seekers of forgotten paths. Harmless. Usually.

“I have a proposition. An escort job.”

A short, harsh laugh escaped him. “Look around, Sister. Do I look like an escort? Hire Borin and his shiny boys. They’re in the market.”

“I require discretion, not a parade,” she said, her voice still calm. “And I am going into The Blighted Wastes.”

That got his full attention. East of the city, the Wastes were a day’s march of cracked earth, sulphurous vents, and things that scuttled in the bad light. No one went there willingly without a death wish or something worse to flee.

“A shrine,” Anya continued, anticipating his question.ting his question. “The Chapel of Whispering Stones. It is a pilgrimage of my Order. A simple journey there and back. Five days in total.” “Simple,” Kael echoed. “Nothing simple about The Blighted Wastes. Dust-wraiths. Sink-holes. Bandits who’ve got nothing left to lose.” “Hence the need for an escort. One who knows the land, and how to move through… unpleasantness.” “I’m out of that business.” “Your sword suggests otherwise.” His gaze snapped to hers, a flicker of the old fire in his gut. “The sword is rusted shut, Sister. It’s a club. A very expensive, useless club.” “Then it matches the man,” she said, and there was no malice in it, only a blunt assessment that was somehow worse than Borin’s cruelty. “But a club in the hands of a former master is better than a sharp blade in the hands of a fool. I am not a fool, Kael. I have done my research. You were the best pathfinder the Covenant ever had. You know The Blighted Wastes like the lines of your own hand.” “That man died at Greywall.” “Perhaps. But his eyes still see. His legs can still walk.” She leaned forward slightly. “The pay is fifty silver crowns. Half now, half upon our return.” The number hung in the air, sucking the sound from the room. It was a fortune. A year’s good earnings. Enough to drink himself into a stupor for months, to rent a real room, to forget. To truly disappear. “Why so much?” he asked, suspicion a cold worm in his chest. “The Wastes are dangerous. I am paying for risk. And for silence.” She met his eyes. “This is a private matter of faith. No one must know my route or my purpose.” He studied her. The earnest set of her jaw, the clear, steady eyes. She was hiding something, of course. Everyone was. But her coin was real. He could almost feel its weight, hear its promise of oblivion. “Twenty-five now,” he said, his voice rough. Without a word, she reached into a pouch at her belt and placed a heavy, cloth-wrapped bundle on the table. It clinked softly. She peeled back a corner. The silver crowns glittered in the tavern’s foul light, clean and sharp and beautiful. “We leave at first light. The East Gate.” Kael stared at the coins. This was madness. A nun, The Blighted Wastes, a rusted sword. But the silver sang to him. It was an answer, however temporary, to the screaming silence inside his head. It was a door out of this tavern, away from Borin’s sneers, away from the ghost that sat in his chair. He reached out and pulled the bundle towards him. The weight was profound. “First light,” he said. * Dawn in the city of Tel-Sarrow was a grey smear, the sun struggling to pierce the perpetual haze of smoke from the tanneries and smithies. Kael waited by the East Gate, his few possessions—a bedroll, a waterskin, a whetstone he never used—in a pack on his back. Oathkeeper was a familiar, guilty weight on his hip. He’d used a few coppers of Anya’s advance to buy a waxed cloak and some hardtack. The rest sat in his purse, a guilty, glorious anchor. Sister Anya arrived as the portcullis was being winched up. She moved with a quiet efficiency, her robes exchanged for tougher, travel-worn versions of the same, her satchel still across her chest. She carried a simple staff of dark wood. She nodded to him, no smile, and they passed under the iron teeth of the gate without a word. The road quickly deteriorated from packed earth to a rutted track, the city’s stench giving way to the dry, alkaline smell of the approaching Wastes. They walked in silence for an hour, the only sounds their footsteps and the distant caw of carrion birds. Kael’s senses, dulled by years of drink and regret, began to prickle awake. He scanned the scrubland automatically, noting the lay of the land, the places for ambush, the best paths for quick retreat. It was a muscle memory, painful in its resurgence. “You don’t ask why I chose you,” Anya said suddenly, her voice cutting the silence. “The coin chose me,” Kael replied. “It’s more than that. At Greywall… you were the only one who came out alive from the inner keep. The only one who saw what happened.” Ice water flooded Kael’s veins. He stopped walking. “What do you know of Greywall?” She turned to face him, her slate eyes grave. “I know it fell in a single night when it should have held for a month. I know the Sorcerer-King’s forces were said to have used dark magic to breach walls that had never fallen. I know you were the last commander standing.” She paused. “And I know an oath was broken there. Not just yours. Many.” “You know nothing,” he snarled, the words tearing from a raw place. “You read it in a book. You didn’t smell the blood. You didn’t hear the…” He choked off, seeing the faces again. Not the enemy’s. His own men’s. As the silence spread from the inner keep, as they realized no orders were coming. “I am not your judge, Kael,” Anya said softly. “I am a seeker of truths. Sometimes they are buried in ruins. Sometimes they are carried by broken men.” “What truth are you seeking Kael’s breath froze in his lungs. The freshly carved sigil—the Eye of Tel—was a watching mark. A ward, or a warning. Coincidence was a luxury men like him couldn’t afford.

He looked sharply at Anya, who stood gazing at the desolation ahead. “A simple pilgrimage,” she’d said. The silver in his purse felt like lead. The rust on his sword like a sentence.

“Anya,” he said, his voice dangerously low. “This mark. It’s fresh. Placed since we left the city.”

She didn’t turn. “I know.”

The quiet admission hit him harder than any lie. “You knew it would be here.”

Finally, she glanced back, her expression not serene, but grimly resigned. “I told you I needed a confirmation. This is it. They know we’re coming, Kael. They’ve known all along.”

The past wasn’t just awake. It had been expecting them. And as Kael stared at her, a colder truth slithered into place: this was no pilgrimage. It was a delivery. He was the hired sword, yes, but the silver wasn’t a fee. It was a purchase price. She hadn’t just hired him for the journey.

She had bought him for the altar.
