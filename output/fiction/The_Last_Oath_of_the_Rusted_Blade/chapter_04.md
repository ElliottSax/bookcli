Chapter 4: The Golem's Wake

Chapter 4: The Golem’s Wake

The Ashen Wastes didn’t just look dead; they sounded it. A hollow, whispering wind scraped over bleached stone, the only break in a silence so profound it made the blood pound in Kael’s ears. It was the third day since the shelter, since Anya’s revelation. The book in her oilskin pack might as well have been a lodestone for doom. The air between them had shifted from wary silence to a taut, shared dread. They spoke only when necessary, their words clipped and functional.

Kael’s hand, as it had a thousand times since they set out, found the worn leather of the Oathkeeper’s hilt. The rust-pitted blade, still sheathed, was a dead weight against his hip. It used to sing in his hand. Now it was just a piece of scrap, a reminder that oaths were as brittle as old bone.

The first tremor was subtle. A shiver in the pebbles at their feet, a faint grating from deep in the earth. Kael froze, his soldier’s instincts screaming before his mind could form the thought. Anya halted beside him, her breath catching.

“Earthquake?” she whispered, her eyes wide.

“No,” Kael said, his voice gravel. “Footsteps.”

He turned slowly, scanning the shattered plain behind them. For a moment, there was nothing but the wind-rippled dunes and jagged rock spires. Then, from behind a distant mesa, it came.

It was a thing of the waste itself: a hulking, humanoid form of fused sandstone and dark, volcanic rock, standing twelve feet tall. Its body was a crude approximation of a warrior, with slab-like limbs and a head that was little more than a boulder set with two deep, glowing pits of amber light. Sand cascaded from its joints with each ponderous step. It moved with a terrible, geologic certainty, its gaze fixed on them.

“A Sand-Sentinel,” Kael breathed, the old name rising from the depths of memory like a corpse from a bog. “A guardian. It doesn’t sleep. It only waits.”

“For what?” Anya asked, already shrugging her pack tighter, her fingers white on her staff.

“For intruders. For thieves.” He shot her a look. “For people carrying things that don’t belong to them.”

The Sentinel’s pace quickened, its strides eating the distance with shocking speed. The ground trembled in earnest now.

“Run!” Kael barked.

They ran. Not with the frantic panic of civilians, but with the desperate, energy-conserving stride of the hunted. Kael led them towards a region of higher ground, a labyrinth of wind-carved canyons he’d noted earlier. The thunderous crunch of stone-on-stone followed, relentless.

Anya risked a glance back. “Arrows? Your sword?”

“Won’t even chip it,” Kael grunted, his lungs burning. “It’s not flesh. It’s a concept given form. A ‘no’ carved in rock.”

“Shield-wall! Brace!” Captain Rourke’s voice cut through the memory-smell of damp earth and fear. Not a battlefield, but a cavern, deep under the Citadel of Thrones. Before them, in the ritual chamber, a construct of polished obsidian and brass had stirred, its gemstone eyes igniting. A test from a bygone age. Kael, then just a sworn brother of the Iron Covenant, felt the holy weight of the Oathkeeper in his grip. It wasn’t just steel; it was a key. “Aim for the sigils!” Rourke had yelled. “The magic that binds it!” Kael remembered the feel of it—the blade humming, not with power of its own, but resonating with the construct’s enchantment, finding the flaw in the song, the weak note in the chord of its being. He’d lunged, not at its body, but at the glowing rune on its chest. The Oathkeeper had slid home not with a crunch, but with a sound like shattering crystal. The light died. The lesson was etched in him: you fight a golem with knowledge, not strength.

That knowledge was useless now. The Oathkeeper on his back was a silent, rusted mockery of that memory.

They plunged into the canyon’s shadow, the high walls of striated rock narrowing around them. The Sentinel did not slow. It simply turned its shoulder and ploughed into the entrance, stone grinding against stone, shedding dust and rubble but never halting.

“It’s herding us!” Anya cried, as the canyon forked ahead.

“I know!” Kael’s eyes raked the cliffs. He was looking for a specific kind of weakness, the kind siege engineers and quarry masters knew. He saw it to the left—a vast, overhanging shelf of conglomerate rock, fractured from the main cliff face by eons of frost and heat. Beneath it, the canyon was a choke point, littered with house-sized boulders.

“This way!” He grabbed Anya’s arm, pulling her left. The Sentinel followed, its amber eyes casting long, searching beams through the settling dust.

They scrambled over the rocky debris, the golem’s footsteps now echoing monstrously in the confined space. Kael pushed Anya behind a large rock. “Stay here. Don’t move until I call.”

“What are you doing?”

“An old trick.” He met her eyes, saw the fear there, but also a fierce, stubborn light. “If it doesn’t work, run. Don’t look back.”

He didn’t wait for a reply. Darting out, he raised his arms and shouted, a raw, challenging roar that bounced off the canyon walls. “Here! Stone-brain! I’m your relic! Come and claim me!”

The Sentinel’s head swivelled. It fixed on him and charged, a juggernaut of pure destruction.

Kael stood his ground, heart hammering against his ribs. The smell of hot stone and ancient dust filled his nostrils. He counted its steps, the vibrations travelling up through his boots. Closer. Closer. He could see the intricate, unnatural whorls carved into its rocky hide, the faint pulse of amber light in the cracks. This wasn’t some wild elemental. This was made. This was sent.

At the last possible second, he dove sideways, rolling behind a pillar of stone. The Sentinel, unable to stop its momentum, barrelled past him, directly into the choke point beneath the overhang.

Kael scrambled to his feet, drawing the short, heavy hatchet from his belt. It was a tool, not a weapon. He sprinted to a specific spot—a vertical crack where the overhang met the cliff. He’d seen the tell-tale spill of loose scree. Ignoring the looming giant turning back towards him, he began to hack at the crack, not at the rock itself, but at the smaller, key stones wedged within it.

Thwack. Thwack. The blows sent jolts of pain up his bad shoulder. The Sentinel took a step towards him, raising a fist the size of a burial cairn.

Thwack. Thwack. A stone shifted. Dust rained down.

The fist came down. Kael threw himself backwards. The impact shook the world, splintering the ground where he’d stood. The shockwave threw him against the canyon wall. A white-hot lance of agony seared through his left side—the old wound, the one that never truly healed, torn open anew. He cried out, the sound lost in the rumble.

Gritting his teeth, vision swimming, he looked up. The Sentinel was pulling its fist free, readying another blow. Above it, the overhang groaned. Kael found a final reserve of strength, a last surge of the will that had once commanded men. He lurched to his feet, raised the hatchet, and with a guttural scream, drove it into the crack as a lever, and threw his weight against it.

There was a deep, groaning crack, the sound of the earth breaking a promise.

The Sentinel looked up, its amber eyes flaring.

Then, with a sigh that became a roar, the entire overhang gave way. Thousands of tons of rock peeled away from the cliff face and fell, a slow, then devastating cascade. It wasn’t a clean burial. It was an avalanche of punishment. Boulders smashed into the construct, shattering its limbs, pounding its body into the ground. Dust exploded outward in a choking cloud, blinding and thick.

Kael was hurled from his feet again, tumbling over the rough ground. He came to a stop on his back, staring up at the boiling cloud of dust that blotted out the sky. The world was reduced to sound: the diminishing crash of stone, the settling hiss of rubble, and then, blessedly, silence.

He lay there, breathing in grit, the pain in his side a throbbing, sickening fire. He could feel the warm seep of blood through his tunic and leathers. The old wound. The price of a different failure.

Footsteps, small and quick, approached. Anya’s face appeared above him, etched with fear and relief. “You’re alive.”

“Debatable,” he coughed, tasting dust and copper.

She knelt, her practised hands already moving. She pulled his tunic up, hissing at the sight. The old, poorly-healed scar from a Blackwolf’s spearhead was a livid purple tear across his ribs, now freshly split and leaking blood. “This is bad.”

“It’s old,” he muttered, closing his eyes. “Just bind it.”

She worked in silence, tearing a strip from her own underskirt, cleaning the wound with water from her skin—a precious commodity—before packing it with a poultice from her healer’s kit and winding a tight bandage around his torso. Her touch was firm, clinical, but not unkind.

“You knew how to kill it,” she said quietly, not looking at him.

“I knew how to bury it. There’s a difference.”

“You stood your ground. You used the land as a weapon. That wasn’t the tactic of a… a destitute escort.”

Kael opened his eyes. The dust was settling, revealing the monstrous, ragged tomb of rock they had created. The Sentinel was gone, but the waste was full of sentinels. “It was the tactic of a man who doesn’t want to be crushed,” he said flatly.

She finished the knot, her hands resting for a moment on the bandage. “Thank you,” she said, the words seeming to cost her. “You saved the book. You saved me.”

He pushed himself up onto his elbows, wincing. “Don’t. I did it because the thing was between me and the way out. Nothing more.”

A flicker of something—anger, understanding—passed over her face. “You can tell yourself that. But your body tells a different story.” She gestured to his side. “This is an old soldier’s wound. And that,” she pointed a finger at the hilt of the Oathkeeper, still strapped to his back, “is an old soldier’s blade. Rusted, but not forgotten. I see you touch it. Like it’s a ghost you can’t shake.”

Kael looked away, towards the canyon wall. The silence stretched, filled only with their breathing and the distant wind. The adrenaline was fading, leaving him cold and hollow and aching. The ghost of the Sentinel seemed less haunting than the ghosts her words summoned.

“It’s just a piece of metal,” he said finally, his voice hoarse.

“Is it?” Anya sat back on her heels, studying him. “You knew that thing was a guardian for relics. You called it a ‘Sand-Sentinel.’ That’s a name from the Covenant’s own bestiaries. You’re no mere deserter, Kael. You’re Oathbroken.”

The word hung in the air, heavier than stone. It was not an accusation, but a statement. A recognition.

He didn’t deny it. What was the point? The evidence was carved into his body and his soul. He just stared at the tomb of rocks, seeing not a victory, but another monument to failure. He’d buried a guardian, but he couldn’t bury the past.

“The book,” he said, changing the subject, the only defence he had left. “It’s what woke it. It’s drawing them. What in the seven hells is so important that the abbey would send one sister and a broken man to protect it?”

Anya hugged her knees to her chest. “I told you. It’s a key. A key to a door that should never be opened. My order believes it must be taken to the Shrouded Vaults, to be sealed away with other such blasphemies. But others… others believe it should be used. The Iron Covenant among them, I suspect. They always coveted power in the form of secrets.”

Kael’s blood ran cold, but before he could respond, a glint of something on the canyon wall caught his eye. Near the entrance, where the Sentinel had first ground against the rock. He struggled to his feet, ignoring the protest in his side, and stumbled over.

“What is it?” Anya asked, following.

He didn’t answer. He brushed away the fresh dust from the rock face. There, carved with precise, military efficiency, was a symbol: a stylised anvil struck by a lightning bolt, enclosed in a circle. It was recent, the edges still sharp.

The world seemed to tilt. The pain, the exhaustion, the dust—all of it coalesced into a cold, hard knot in his gut.

“Kael?” Anya’s voice was wary.

He traced the symbol with a trembling, grime-caked finger. It was a trail marker. A directive. The language of hunters.

“We need to move,” he said, his voice utterly drained of all emotion. “Now.”

“Why? What does it mean?”

He turned to look at her, his face ashen. The last of his defences crumbled, not with a shout, but with a whisper.

“It means my former brothers are here. And they’re not lost.”
