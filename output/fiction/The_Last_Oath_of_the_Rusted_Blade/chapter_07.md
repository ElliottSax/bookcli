Chapter 7: The Sorcerer-King's Price

Chapter 7: The Sorcerer-King’s Price

The air in the throne room was a perfumed poison. It smelled of crushed night-blooms, incense ash, and beneath it all, the sharp, clean scent of ozone that spoke of immense, coiled power. It was a scent that made the back of Kael’s throat ache and his empty scabbard feel like a child’s toy.
He and Anya were forced to their knees on a floor of polished black obsidian, so flawless it reflected their battered, grimy faces back at them in grotesque parody. Their hands were bound behind them with cords of living shadow that writhed coldly against their skin. The guards who had brought them—silent, armored figures with featureless helms—stood like statues of iron and leather, flanking the long approach to the dais.
And on that dais sat the Sorcerer-King of Tel.
He was not the monstrous, bloated tyrant of fireside tales. He was elegance given form, and cruelty given a handsome face. He looked perhaps forty, with silver-streaked black hair swept back from a high forehead, a neatly trimmed beard, and eyes the colour of a winter twilight. He wore robes of deep plum, unadorned, the fabric so fine it appeared to drink the light from the hundreds of floating witch-globes that illuminated the vast chamber. One long-fingered hand rested on the arm of his throne—a chair carved from a single, massive geode, its interior glittering with amethyst crystals. The other hand held a simple, polished rod of grey metal.
“The hunters return with curious prey,” the King’s voice was a smooth baritone, devoid of the need to shout. It filled the space effortlessly. “A broken sellsword with a famous name, and a scholar of the Lost College who smells of desert dust and desperate hope. Welcome.”

Anya lifted her chin. “You know who we are. You sent your… things after us.” Her voice was hoarse but steady.
“I sent invitations,” the King corrected, a faint smile touching his lips. “The Wastes are so dreadfully final. I preferred a conversation.” His twilight eyes shifted to Kael. “Kaelen of the Rusted Blade. I knew your father. A pragmatic man. He understood power has a price. You, I am told, are more… sentimental.”

Kael said nothing. He kept his gaze locked on the King’s face, a soldier’s trick. Look at the man, not the terrifying splendor around him. Not at the shifting murals on the walls thato depict screaming faces. Not at the silent, robed attendants who stood in alcoves, their eyes milky and unseeing.
“You have something I desire,” the King continued, leaning forward slightly. The ozone scent strengthened. “The Atlas of Moments. A crude name for a sublime artifact. You seek to destroy it. A waste of a divine tool.”

“It’s a weapon,” Anya spat. “It unmade gods. It shattered realms. It is not a tool for any mortal hand, especially not one that seeks to carve his name into the bones of the world.”

The King’s smile didn’t waver, but his eyes cooled. “Such passion. Such… limited vision.” He stood, descending the dais steps with a predator’s grace. The shadow-bindings on Kael’s wrists tightened in response to his movement. “The God-Severance was a tragedy of misapplication. The ancients used a scalpel to perform a decapitation. I intend finer work.”

He stopped before Anya, looking down at her. “The world is sick, child. Sick with wild magic, with the bleating prayers of lesser beings, with the chaotic sparks of hedge-wizards and village cunning-folk. This sickness is the source of The Blighted Wastes, of the monsters that gnaw at the edges of civilization. My work—the purification of Tel—is but the first step. With the Atlas, I cannot just cleanse a city. I can scour the world. I can sever the connection to the chaotic old powers entirely. A world of perfect, orderly silence. No more unpredictable sorcery. Only my will. A final, lasting peace.”

The horror of his vision was so vast, so calmly stated, that for a moment Kael could only feel numb. This wasn’t conquest. It was genocide on a metaphysical scale.
“You’d make a graveyard and call it peace,” Kael growled, the words tearing from him.
The King turned his gaze on him. “I would save it. And you, broken blade, could be part of that salvation.” He gestured with the grey rod. One of the featureless guards stepped forward, carrying a long object wrapped in velvet. He unrolled it at Kael’s knees.
It was a sword. Its blade was dark, smoky steel, etched with runes that pulsed with a faint blue light. Its hilt was wrapped in black leather, the crossguard shaped like spread raven’s wings. It was beautiful. It was deadly. It was everything the Rusted Blade had once been, and more.
“Your father’s sword,” the King said softly. “The true Raven’s Wing. Lost at the Battle of the Crying Stones. I recovered it. I can restore it to you. Not as a rusted symbol of failure, but as a commander’s badge. My armies need a general with fire in his heart. Lead my Iron Covenant. They are… familiar to you.”

As he spoke, a side door opened. Five figures marched in, their tread heavy and synchronized. They wore the familiar, battle-worn plate of the Iron Covenant, the mercenary company Kael had once called brothers. But their faces were slack, eyes distant. Around each of their necks glowed a band of crystal, emitting a soft, malevolent green light. Valen was among them, his fierce intelligence replaced by a hollow stare. Kael’s gut twisted.
“You collar them like dogs,” Kael whispered, fury rising hot and bitter.
“I direct them,” the King corrected. “Their wills were weak, cluttered with loyalties and desires. Now, they are perfect instruments. You would not be collared, Kaelen. You would be their master. All I ask in return…” He turned back to Anya. “…is the scholar. Her mind is sharp, trained to decipher the old ways. She will help me unlock the Atlas’s finer mechanisms. You will have your honor, your blade, and your purpose back. She will have a place of supreme importance in the new order. A fair bargain.”

Anya looked at Kael. Her face was pale, her lips a thin line. She didn’t plead. She just glanced. And in that look, he saw the desert cave, her hand on his as they shared the memory-crystal’s pain. He saw her stubborn hope, her belief that some things were too terrible to be used.
The King saw the look. “Sentiment,” he sighed, as if disappointed. “The rust that corrodes strong metal.” He raised his free hand. The witch-globes dimmed. The obsidian floor seemed to way into starless night, and illusion bloomed around them.
they were standing in a thriving city square under a summer sun. Children laughed, vendors shouted, the air smelled of baking bread and flowers. It was Tel, but a Tel from a century past, vibrant and alive. Then, the King clenched his fist.
The corruption bloomed. Stone cracked with sickly green light. Citizens screamed as their flesh twisted, becoming the monstrous, half-formed things that now haunted The Blighted Wastes. The beautiful buildings melted like wax, revealing the skeletal, blackened structures beneath. The sun was blotted out by a wave of necrotic energy. In seconds, the paradise was a familiar, screaming hellscape—The Blighted Wastes as they were now.
“This is the sickness,” the King’s voice echoed through the illusion. “Spreading, inexorable. I stopped it here, at my walls, but it grows. Only the Atlas can burn it out at the root.”

The scene shifted again. They saw a vision of the world the King promised: silent, clean cities under a uniform grey sky. No magic, except the orderly, golden streams that flowed from central spires—his spires. No discord. No individuality. A world of still, perfect peace. It was more terrifying than The Blighted Wastes.
The illusion was masterful, visceral. Kael phantom heat of the old sun, then the chilling despair of the corruption. He saw Anya flinch as a phantom monster scrabbled at her feet. The King’s power was not simply in force, but in persuasion, in making his nightmare seem like the only sane choice.
And in that moment of overwhelming sensory deception, Kael’s fingers found the small, sharp shard in the hidden seam of his vambrace. The memory-crystal fragment from the cave. It was warm, almost vibrating. Anya had replied they stored raw experience, emotion, memory. And they were fragile.
He had no magic. But he had a soldier’s instinct for disruption.
As the King painted his glorious, silent world, Kael drove the sharp edge of the crystal shard into the palm of his bound hand. The pain was bright and clean. He focused on it, poured every chaotic, discordant memory into it—the taste of fear in the desert, the weight of his broken father’s blade, the sound of Anya’s voice arguing for hope, the wrongness of Valen’s hollow eyes. He focused not on order, but on the messy, painful, vibrant chaos of living.
He squeezed his bleeding fist and crystal shard shatter.
A soundless pulse, visible as a ripple of distorted air, burst from him. It was a wave of pure, unfiltered dissonance—pain, loyalty, fury, despair—the antithesis of the King’s controlled illusion.
The perfect, silent world fractured like a struck mirror.
The witch-globes flared blindingly white and then went out, plunging the throne room into near-darkness, save for the eerie green glow of the collars. The King’s illusion shattered into jagged, meaningless shards of light and shadow before winking out. The perfumed air was now sharp with the smell of burnt ozone and blood. The King staggered back a step, a flicker of genuine shock on his refined face. His connection to the elaborate magic had been violently severed.
“Now!” Kael roared, surging to his feet. The shadow-bindings, disrupted by the psychic backlash, loosened. He tore his hands free, feeling the cold cords dissolve into smoke.
Chaos erupted.
The collared Iron Covenant soldiers, their controlled link momentarily jarred, stumbled. One let out a guttural, confused roar. The featureless guards moved with inhuman speed, drawing blades that hummed with energy.
Anya was already up, driving her shoulder into the gut of the nearest guard. He grunted, his armor clattering. She wasn’t a warrior, but she was desperate and clever, and she snatched the grey metal rod from where the King had let it fall.
Kael didn’t go for the offered Raven’s Wing. It was a trap, a bargain he had already refused. Instead, he lunged for the nearest collared mercenary—a hulking man named Bor—and grabbed the man’s own dagger from his belt. He parried a humming blade from a guard, the impact jolting up his arm. The fight was a mad scramble in the gloom.
He fought toward Anya, a whirlwind of desperate violence. He used the dagger to deflect, to slash at joints in armor, to create space. He was a brawler in a duel of sorcerers, a discordant note crashing through the symphony.
He saw Valen. His former lieutenant was shaking his head, the green light of his collar flickering wildly. Their eyes met across the chaos. In Valen’s, for a fleeting second, the hollow stare broke. A storm of anguish, recognition, and fury swirled there. Then, as a guard closed in on Kael from behind, Valen moved.
It wasn’t the controlled march of the collared. It was a jerky, spasmodic act of pure will. He threw himself into the guard’s path, taking the humming blade in his side with a sickening crunch. As he fell, his hand shot out and grabbed Kael’s wrist.
For a second, Kael thought it was an attack. Then he cold press of metal into his palm. A small, keen-edged skinning dagger, its hilt worn smooth from use. Valen’s personal blade, the one he used to whittle by the campfire. The act was swift, hidden by the press of bodies and the dark.
Valen’s lips moved, no sound coming out, but the shape of the word was clear: “Go.”

The green collar flared brightly, and Valen’s body went rigid, his eyes glazing over once more, this time with finality.
A scream of pure rage tore from Kael’s throat. He shoved the tiny dagger into his belt, grabbed Anya’s arm, and turned toward the great arched entrance, now blocked by two more of the King’s guards.
The Sorcerer-King had regained his composure. His face was a mask of cold fury. He didn’t raise his hands for a spell. He simply pointed a finger at Kael.
The air in front of Kael solidified. It was like hitting a wall of transparent iron. He rebounded, nose cracking, stars exploding in his vision. Anya cried out beside him, thrown back by the same invisible barrier.
“Insects,” the King hissed, the word dripping with venom. “You spill your pathetic lives on my floor and think it a victory.”

The pressure build, the invisible wall starting to crush inward. Kael’s ribs creaked. He couldn’t breathe. He fumbled for Valen’s dagger, a useless gesture against such power.
Then Anya, clutching the King’s grey rod, thrust it like a spear at the invisible barrier.
There was a chime, high and clear. The rod vibrated in her hands, and the oppressive pressure vanished. The barrier didn’t shatter; it unwove. The King’s spell unraveled at its touch.
The King’s eyes widened. “The Null-Shaft. You dare…”

But they were already moving. The two guards at the door lunged. Kael, fueled by grief and fury, met one head-on. He didn’t try fancy moves. He dropped low under the humming blade and drove Bor’s dagger up through the guard’s armpit, into the seam of his armor. The man shuddered and fell. Anya, swinging the Null-Shaft like a quarterstaff, caught the other guard across the helm. There was no dramatic impact, but the humming blade sputtered and died, and the guard collapsed as if his strings had been cut.
They burst out of the throne room into a labyrinthine corridor of black stone. Alarmto sound—deep, resonant bellows that seeme from the stone itself. The chase was on.
They ran, breath sobbing in their lungs, through corridors that twisted and turned. The palace was a trap, a living maze. They could hear the booted feet of pursuers, the guttural clicks of unseen things stirring in the shadows.
Anya led, holding the Null-Shaft before her like a dowsing rod. It seemed to quivappeared totain junctions, and she followed its pull. “It disrupts enchantments,” she gasped. “It’s showing us the path of least magical resistance!”

They scrambled down a narrow service stair, through a reeking kitchen where cowering servants hid their faces, and out into a stark courtyard under the bruised-purple twilight sky of Tel. The outer wall loomed ahead, fifty feet of seamless black rock.
“There!” Anya pointed. A small, iron-bound door, barely visible in the wall.
As they sprinted for it, a figure descended from a balcony above, landing without a sound between them and their escape. It was one of the Sorcerer-King’s personal guard, but his featureless helm was now off. His face was pale, his eyes entirely black. He held no weapon. His hands crackled with green lightning.
“The King’s price must be paid,” the man intoned, his voice a chorus of whispers.
Kael pushed Anya behind him, raising the blood-slicked dagger. It was a hopeless gesture. He was exhausted, weaponless against sorcery.
The sorcerer-guard raised a crackling hand.
A crossbow bolt, fired from the shadows of the wall, took him in the side of the neck. He gagged, the green lightning sputtering over his skin before he collapsed.
From a hidden alcove by the door, a figure emerged. A woman, clad in the practical, travel-stained leathers of a scout, a smoking crossbow in her hands. Her face was sharp, her eyes the colour of flint, and a long, pale scar ran from her temple to her jaw.
She didn’t look at the dead guard. Her eyes were fixed on Kael, burning with a mixture of fury and desperate relief.
“Seven years,” she said, her voice raw with emotion. “Seven years I’ve been searching this cursed city for a sign of you, you stubborn bastard.” She lowered the crossbow. “Hello, brother.”
