Chapter 1: The Rust and the Coin

Chapter 1: The Rust and the Coin

The smell of the Guttering Candle was a familiar beast. It was a stew of sour ale, old sweat, boiled cabbage, and the underlying, ever-present tang of despair. Kael sat with his back to the wall, a habit so ingrained his spine curved to fit the damp stone. Before him sat a tankard of something brown and a plate of congealed fat that might once have been stew. His hands, calloused and scarred, rested on the table. One curled loosely around the tankard. The other lay, always, on the leather-bound hilt of the sword at his side.

Oathkeeper. The name was a joke now, a bitter pill on the back of his tongue. It hadn’t been drawn in three years. Not since the Siege of Greywall. Not since the screaming and the silence that followed. The blade was rusted fast in its scabbard, a single, ugly entity of neglect. The scabbard itself was fine tooled leather, worn but of obvious quality, a stark contrast to the rest of him. His tunic was patched, his boots let in the damp, and the cloak he’d once worn with pride was now just a grey rag against the chill.

He didn’t need to look up to know they’d entered. The tavern’s raucous noise dipped, then resumed with a new, sharper edge. Boots, well-oiled and heavy, thudded on the flagstones. The clink of good mail, the scent of metal polish and ambition. They were a splash of colour and threat in the murk: crimson sashes across polished breastplates, the badge of the Iron Covenant—a clenched fist holding a broken chain—gleaming on their shoulders.

Borin led them. His beard was trimmed to a sharp point, his eyes the colour of flint. He’d been a squad-leader under Kael. Now he was a captain. He made a show of scanning the room, his gaze sliding over Kael once, then snapping back with theatrical surprise.

“Gods below,” Borin’s voice cut through the din, too loud, too cheerful. “Is that a ghost in the corner, or just the stink of failure?”

Kael took a slow drink. The ale was piss-warm.

Borin swaggered over, his two companions—young, hard-faced men Kael didn’t know—flanking him. They looked at Kael like he was something they’d scraped off their boots.

“Captain Kael,” Borin said, leaning on the table. The wood creaked. “Or is it just Kael now? Heard you sold the title with your armour. Got a good price for the scrap, I hope.”

One of the young ones sniggered. Kael’s thumb rubbed a familiar groove on Oathkeeper’s crossguard. It was crusted with rust.

“I’m drinking, Borin.” Kael’s voice was a gravel-road whisper, unused.

“What, this?” Borin flicked a finger at Kael’s tankard, sending a wave of the foul liquid sloshing over the rim. “This isn’t drinking. This is drowning. Slowly. Pathetically.” He straightened, his face hardening. “We’ve a contract. South. Bandit cleansing. Good silver. The kind you used to count without thinking.” He leaned in again, his voice dropping to a venomous hiss only Kael could hear. “They asked about you at the chapter-house. I told them the truth. Kael of Greywall is dead. All that’s left is the rust.”

The words hung in the air, sharper than any blade. Kael felt them sink in, hooking into the old, numb places. He saw it again, for a fractured second: not the tavern, but the rain-slicked walls of Greywall, the silence where there should have been rallying cries. The weight of the key in his hand, the one that opened the sally port. A trade. A city for a life. His oath, for hers.

He blinked. Borin was smiling, a thin, cruel thing. “Enjoy your swill.”

They turned, their laughter a physical blow against Kael’s back. He didn’t watch them go. He stared at the puddle of ale on the table, watching a fat fly struggle in it. His hand tightened on Oathkeeper’s hilt. He pulled, a small, secret motion he performed a dozen times a day. A test. A penance. The blade didn’t budge. It was just dead weight, a millstone lashed to his soul. The rust held fast, a judgement more final than any court’s.

He was about to signal for another drink, to truly begin the night’s drowning, when a different shadow fell across his table. Not the bulky, aggressive shadow of mercenary plate, but something softer, smaller. A hood of coarse, undyed wool.

“Kael of the Iron Covenant?”

The voice was a woman’s, low, measured, without mockery. He looked up slowly.

She pushed back her hood. She was younger than he expected, perhaps in her late twenties, with a severe, intelligent face that wasn’t hardened, but focused. Her hair was a dark brown, braided tightly and pinned close to her scalp. Her eyes were the colour of wet slate, and they held his without flinching. She wore the simple, travel-stained robes of a religious order, but there were no holy symbols around her neck. Instead, a leather satchel, bulging with books and scroll-cases, was slung across her body. A pilgrim, maybe. But pilgrims didn’t seek out broken men in the Guttering Candle.

“There is no Kael of the Iron Covenant here,” he said, turning back to his tankard.

“I see.” She didn’t leave. She gestured to the empty bench opposite. “May I?”

“Suit yourself.”

She sat with a rustle of wool, placing her hands flat on the table. They were clean, but the nails were short, the fingers stained with ink. A scholar’s hands.

“My name is Sister Anya, of the Order of the Veiled Map.”

Kael grunted. He’d heard of them. Cartographer-nuns, chroniclers, seekers of forgotten paths. Harmless. Usually.

“I have a proposition. An escort job.”

He barked a laugh, short and harsh. “Look around, Sister. Do I look like an escort? Hire Borin and his shiny boys. They’re in the market.”

“I require discretion, not a parade,” she said, her voice still calm. “And I am going into the Ashen Wastes.”

That got his full attention. The Wastes were a blight east of the city, a day’s march of cracked earth, sulphurous vents, and things that scuttled in the bad light. No one went there willingly. Not unless they had a death wish, or were fleeing something worse.

“A shrine,” Anya continued, anticipating his question. “The Chapel of Whispering Stones. It is a pilgrimage of my Order. A simple journey there and back. Five days in total.”

“Simple,” Kael echoed. “Nothing simple about the Wastes. Dust-wraiths. Sink-holes. Bandits who’ve got nothing left to lose.”

“Hence the need for an escort. One who knows the land, and how to navigate… unpleasantness.”

“I’m out of that business.”

“Your sword suggests otherwise.”

His gaze snapped to hers, a flicker of the old fire in his gut. “The sword is rusted shut, Sister. It’s a club. A very expensive, useless club.”

“Then it matches the man,” she said, and there was no malice in it, only a blunt assessment that was somehow worse than Borin’s cruelty. “But a club in the hands of a former master is better than a sharp blade in the hands of a fool. I am not a fool, Kael. I have done my research. You were the best pathfinder the Covenant ever had. You know the Wastes like the lines of your own hand.”

“That man died at Greywall.”

“Perhaps. But his eyes still see. His legs can still walk.” She leaned forward slightly. “The pay is fifty silver crowns. Half now, half upon our return.”

The number hung in the air, sucking the sound from the room. It was a fortune. A year’s good earnings. Enough to drink himself into a stupor for months, to rent a real room, to forget. To truly disappear.

“Why so much?” he asked, suspicion a cold worm in his chest.

“The Wastes are dangerous. I am paying for risk. And for silence.” She met his eyes. “This is a private matter of faith. No one must know my route or my purpose.”

He studied her. The earnest set of her jaw, the clear, unwavering eyes. She was hiding something, of course. Everyone was. But her coin was real. He could almost feel its weight, hear its promise of oblivion.

“Twenty-five now,” he said, his voice rough.

Without a word, she reached into a pouch at her belt and placed a heavy, cloth-wrapped bundle on the table. It clinked softly. She peeled back a corner. The silver crowns glittered in the tavern’s foul light, clean and sharp and beautiful.

“We leave at first light. The East Gate.”

Kael stared at the coins. This was madness. A nun, the Wastes, a rusted sword. But the silver sang to him. It was an answer, however temporary, to the screaming silence inside his head. ItHe reached out and pulled the bundle towards him. The weight was profound. “First light,” he said. The words hung in the ale-thick air, a vow to the shadows and the empty chair. He would not spend another night drowning in this place. The decision, once a desperate wish, now had the solid heft of the bundle in his hands. Sleep was a forgotten luxury; he spent the remaining dark hours in a corner, the wrapped sword across his knees, watching the guttering candle and listening to the tavern’s wooden bones settle. Each creak was a step closer to departure. When the He moved through the sleeping village like a shadow, the single birdcall answered by a growing chorus that marked the miles beneath his boots. The world blurred from the intimate darkness of a single room to the vast, open road, carrying him from the ghosts of his past toward a future that lay where the roads all converged: the great, grimy heart of the realm.

***

Dawn in the city of Tel-Sarrow was a grey smear, the sun struggling to pierce the perpetual haze of smoke from the tanneries and smithies. After three days of hard travel, the pastoral silence was now a distant memory, replaced by the low, constant rumble of a city stirring to life. Kael waited by the East Gate, his few possessions—a bedroll, a waterskin, and the weight of his purpose—strapped securely to his back, as he scanned the faces of the merchants and guards for the one he had been told to meet. The air here tasted of coal dust and offal, a far cry from the dew-soaked fields he had left behind, but it was here his new life would begin, or end.a waterskin, and the long, cloth-wrapped bundle—strapped securely to his back. The bundle seemed to thrum with a familiar, dormant energy, a counterpoint to the weary ache in his limbs from a night without rest. Around him, the city stirred to life: cart wheels clattering on cobbles, the distant clang of a forge, the murmur of early merchants. He kept his hood drawn up, not against the damp chill alone, but against recognition. The gate guards paid him little mind, just another itinerant soul drawn to the road at first light. He focused on the archway of weathered stone, seeing not the gate but the path beyond, a ribbon of dirt leading away from the smoke and memory, into the uncertain grey of the new day.a waterskin, a whetstone he never used—in a pack on his back. Oathkeeper was a familiar, guilty weight on his hip. He’d used a few coppers of Anya’s advance to buy a waxed cloak and some hardtack. The rest sat in his purse, a guilty, glorious anchor.

Sister Anya arrived as the portcullis was being winched up. She moved with a quiet efficiency, her robes exchanged for tougher, travel-worn versions of the same, her satchel still across her chest. She carried a simple staff of dark wood. She nodded to him, no smile, and they passed under the iron teeth of the gate without a word.

The road quickly deteriorated from packed earth to a rutted track, the city’s stench giving way to the dry, alkaline smell of the approaching Wastes. They walked in silence for an hour, the only sounds their footsteps and the distant caw of carrion birds. Kael’s senses, dulled by years of drink and regret, began to prickle awake. He scanned the scrubland automatically, noting the lay of the land, the places for ambush, the best paths for quick retreat. It was a muscle memory, painful in its resurgence.

“You don’t ask why I chose you,” Anya said suddenly, her voice cutting the silence.

“The coin chose me,” Kael replied.

“It’s more than that. At Greywall… you were the only one who came out alive from the inner keep. The only one who saw what happened.”

Ice water flooded Kael’s veins. He stopped walking. “What do you know of Greywall?”

She turned to face him, her slate eyes grave. “I know it fell in a single night when it should have held for a month. I know the Sorcerer-King’s forces were said to have used dark magic to breach walls that had never fallen. I know you were the last commander standing.” She paused. “And I know an oath was broken there. Not just yours. Many.”

“You know nothing,” he snarled, the words tearing from a raw place. “You read it in a book. You didn’t smell the blood. You didn’t hear the…” He choked off, seeing the faces again. Not the enemy’s. His own men’s. As the silence spread from the inner keep, as they realized no orders were coming.

“I am not your judge, Kael,” Anya said softly. “I am a seeker of truths. Sometimes they are buried in ruins. Sometimes they are carried by broken men.”

“What truth are you seeking in a dusty chapel?” he asked, his anger subsiding into a weary suspicion.

“A confirmation,” she said, and would elaborate no further. She resumed walking.

Frustrated, Kael fell in beside her, his hand resting once more on the rusted hilt. The past was a clawed thing in his chest, and she had just raked it open. He wanted to turn back, to return her silver and lose himself in the city’s filth. But the coin felt like a chain now, pulling him forward.

As they reached the final rise before the land truly broke into the cracked badlands of the Ashen Wastes, Kael glanced back one last time at the distant, hazy silhouette of Tel-Sarrow. His eyes dropped to the massive, weathered gatepost they had passed just an hour before.

And there it was.

Carved into the grey stone, fresh enough that the chisel marks showed pale against the weathered surface, was a sigil. A single, stylized eye, with a serpent coiled where the pupil should be. It was no crude graffiti. It was precise, deliberate.

The Eye of Tel. The mark of the Sorcerer-King.

Kael’s breath froze in his lungs. It was a watching mark. A ward, or a warning. Placed here, on the road to the Wastes. Coincidence was a luxury men like him couldn’t afford.

He looked sharply at Anya, who was a few paces ahead, gazing out at the desolation before them. Her profile was serene, determined. A simple pilgrimage, she’d said.

The silver in his purse felt suddenly like lead. The rust on his sword felt like a sentence. And the freshly carved eye on the gatepost felt like a promise—that the past was not buried in ruins at all. It was awake. It was watching.

And it was waiting for them in the Wastes.
