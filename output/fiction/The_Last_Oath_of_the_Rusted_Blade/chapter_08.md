Chapter 8: The Blood of the Covenant

Chapter 8: The Blood of the Covenant

The world had shrunk to the space between heartbeats, to the rasp of breath in a raw throat, to the slick give of mud underfoot. Kael dragged Anya behind a wagon heaped with sacks of rancid grain, the stench thick enough to taste. The Sorcerer-King’s camp was a waking beast around them—a chaos of shouted orders, clanking metal, and the low, pervasive hum of the Telish collars.

“Left flank,” Anya hissed, her voice a dry leaf in the storm. Blood matted the silver of her hair, not her own. Not yet.

Kael risked a glance. Three of them, moving in the practiced wedge formation of the Rusted Blade. Garric, broad as an ox, his axe held low. Pello, with his tell-tale limp and deadly spear. And between them, Finn, the youngest, his face a mask of grim duty under the iron band at his throat. Boys they’d shared ale and stories with. Men he’d trusted with his back in a hundred hells.

“They’re herding us,” Kael growled, his hand tightening on the worn leather of his sword’s scabbard. His actual blade, the notched falchion, was gone, lost in the first frantic moments of their capture’s end. All he had left was the dagger at his belt and the empty sheath in his hand. A fitting weapon for a traitor.

“Towards the command tents,” Anya finished. She clutched the Atlas to her chest, its cold, metallic weight seeming to pulse in time with the camp’s sorcerous heartbeat. “They want us cornered.”

“Then we don’t go cornered.” Kael met her eyes. The fear was there, a flicker in her grey depths, but beneath it was the flinty resolve that had carried her across The Blighted Wastes. He gave a curt nod. “On my move. Straight through them.”

“Through?” Her eyebrow arched.

“The Blade’s wedge is for absorbing a charge, not for a rat running up its gut.” He hefted the scabbard. “Stay behind me. No matter what you see.”

He didn’t wait for her agreement. He exploded from cover, not with a warrior’s roar, but with a predator’s silent sprint. Mud flung from his boots. The distance closed in three pounding heartbeats.

Garric saw him first, his eyes widening in recognition, then hardening. “Kael! Don’t—”

Kael didn’t break stride. He dropped into a slide, the churned mud swallowing his legs, and passed between Garric’s planted boots. As he slid, he swung the heavy brass-bound tip of the scabbard upward with all his strength. It connected with a sickening, wet crunch between Garric’s legs. The big man’s breath left him in a silent, agonized whoosh, his axe tumbling from nerveless fingers as he folded.

Pello’s spear thrust down, aiming for Kael’s exposed back. Anya was there, not with a warrior’s block, but with a scavenger’s cunning. She threw a handful of the foul grain into Pello’s face. He flinched, the spear thrust going wide, burying itself in the mud. Kael was already rolling, coming up inside Pello’s guard. He saw the old scar on the man’s cheek, a gift from a bandit lord in the Stonelands. He saw the confusion and betrayal in his eyes.

“I’m sorry, brother,” Kael whispered, and drove his dagger up under Pello’s ribs, seeking the heart. The man shuddered, his mouth working soundlessly, then slumped against Kael, warm blood soaking through both their tunics. It smelled of copper and memories.

Finn, the boy, stood frozen for a critical second. It was long enough. Kael shoved Pello’s body aside and charged, leading with his shoulder. He barreled into Finn, sending them both crashing into the side of a water barrel. The impact knocked the air from the youth. Kael pinned him, the dagger raised. Finn’s face was inches away, tear-streaked, his collar glowing a faint, sickly green.

“Please, Kael,” Finn choked. “The collar… it burns if we disobey. He makes us see things…”

Kael’s arm trembled. This was the boy who’d mended his cloak after the Battle of the Cleft. Who’d laughed too loud at bad jokes around the fire. The dagger felt like a lodestone in his fist, pulling him down towards a sin he could never wash away.

A crossbow bolt thudded into the water barrel beside his head, splintering wood and spraying them with lukewarm water.

“Go!” Anya screamed, pulling at his shoulder.

With a strangled cry that was part rage, part sob, Kael reversed his grip and brought the dagger’s pommel down hard on Finn’s temple. The boy’s eyes rolled back. He went limp. It was a mercy. Maybe. Kael didn’t know anymore. He just knew the blood on his hands was now a mixture of enemy and kin, and it all felt the same—hot and damning.

They ran, cutting a bloody, desperate path through the camp. Kael fought with the savage economy of a cornered animal. He used the scabbard to break wrists and knees, the dagger for killing strokes he tried to make quick. Each face was a ghost. Each cry a name from a past life. He was a ghost himself, haunting his own history, and the toll was a hollowing ache in his chest that threatened to collapse his lungs.

The outer picket line was in sight, the twisted, dark-barked trees of the Telish hinterlands offering a promise of shadow. Then he stepped into the clearing before the command pavilion, and the promise died.

Valen stood alone in the center, his sword—Kael’s old sword, the one he’d left behind—drawn and held in a ready guard. The rest of the camp had formed a loose, silent circle around the clearing, a ring of firelight and hate. Valen’s collar glowed brighter than the others, a pulsating emerald shackle. His face was a carved monument, but his eyes… his eyes were a storm of conflict, the man fighting the magic that bound him.

“Captain,” Kael said, the title ash on his tongue.

“Traitor,” Valen replied, the word flat, mandated by the collar.

“You know that’s not true.”

“I know you broke the oath. You left the Blade. You stole from our employer.” Valen’s voice hitched, a tiny crack in the facade. “You left us.”

The truth of it, the personal, wounded truth beneath the sorcerous compulsion, hit Kael harder than any blow. He had left them. To their fate. To this.

“I am leaving now, Valen,” Kael said, spreading his arms, the dagger in one hand, the scarred scabbard in the other. “With her. With the Atlas. Stand aside.”

“I cannot.”

“Then you’ll die.”

“Then I’ll die fulfilling my contract.” Valen saluted, blade to forehead. The old, familiar gesture was a knife-twist. “To the last oath, Kael.”

“To the last,” Kael echoed, and the world narrowed to the space between them.

Valen attacked. It was not the fluid, powerful style of the man Kael had trained with for a decade. It was sharper, more brutal, fueled by magical compulsion and a deep, personal hurt. Kael parried the first overhead chop with the scabbard, the impact jolting his arm to the shoulder. He ducked the backswing, feeling the wind of the blade part his hair.

He was hopelessly outmatched. A dagger and a length of leather and wood against a master swordsman with a yard of hardened steel. Kael’s only advantage was that he knew Valen, every strength, every tiny flaw. And Valen, bound by the collar’s imperative to capture or kill, fought with a predictable ferocity.

Kael gave ground, letting Valen drive him back. He parried, not to meet strength with strength, but to deflect, to redirect. He used the mud, the uneven ground, the scattered debris of the camp. He fought not as a warrior, but as a survivor. The scabbard took terrible damage, the leather splitting, the brass fittings dented. A grazing cut opened a line of fire across his ribs. Another sliced his thigh.

Valen pressed, relentless. “You’re slowing, old man,” he grunted, a ghost of their old sparring taunts in his tone.

“You’re getting predictable, Captain,” Kael shot back, gasping.

A feint high, a true thrust low. Kael saw it coming—the River Fork Thrust, a move they’d drilled a thousand times. Instead of leaping back, he stepped in, turning his body. The sword tip ripped through his side, a blaze of white-hot agony. But it was inside his guard.

He trapped the blade against his body with his left arm, ignoring the searing pain. Valen, shocked by the move, was open for a fraction of a second. Kael brought the dagger in his right hand up, not towards Valen’s heart, but across his face. Valen flinched back, but the pommel of the dagger struck the glowing green stone set in the center of his iron collar.

A sound like shattering ice filled the clearing. Emerald light spider-webbed through the collar. Valen’s eyes, wide with sudden, terrifying clarity, met Kael’s. The compulsion shattered.

Valen staggered, dropping the sword. He clawed at the broken collar, the pieces falling away to the mud. A collective gasp went through the encircling soldiers. The Sorcerer-King’s hold was broken.

Kael slumped, blood streaming from his side. The world swam. He saw Valen look from his own hands to the fallen collar, to Kael’s bleeding form, to Anya holding the Atlas behind him. The storm in his eyes cleared, leaving a desolate, understanding shore.

“The camp… he’ll know the second it broke,” Valen said, his voice his own again, rough with emotion. He looked at Kael, a lifetime of friendship and rivalry passing between them in that glance. “Go. Take the tree-line due west. There’s a game trail.”

“Valen, come with us,” Kael gritted out, the pain making his vision pulse.

A sad, fierce smile touched Valen’s lips. He bent and picked up his sword. “I broke a different oath, brother. The one to the man who paid us. The Blade’s reputation is all I have left. Besides,” he turned, facing the command tent, where angry shouts were now rising. “Someone needs to give you a proper head start.”

“They’ll kill you.”

“They’ll try.” Valen settled into his true fighting stance, fluid and deadly. “Get the girl and that damn book to the city. Make it mean something.”

There were no more words. They were men of action, and their last conversation was written in blood and loyalty. Valen turned and let out a roar that shook the firelight, charging not towards Kael, but towards the heart of the camp, towards the emerging Telish shock troops. He moved like a tempest, his sword a blur of silver, cutting a red swathe into the ranks, creating chaos, a light of glorious, suicidal defiance.

“Now, Kael!” Anya was at his side, hauling him up. He leaned on her, and together they stumbled towards the dark tree line. He glanced back once, just in time to see Valen, surrounded by a dozen spears, drive his blade through a Telish officer before a spear took him in the back. He fell, not with a cry, but with a final, defiant shout that was swallowed by the night.

Then they were in the trees, the darkness swallowing them, the sounds of the camp fading behind. They ran until Kael’s legs gave out, collapsing against a moss-covered boulder. Anya pressed a wad of cloth against his side, her face pale in the faint moonlight filtering through the branches.

He was shivering, from blood loss, from the cold, from the hollow where his past had just been carved out. Anya’s hand found his, her fingers cold and strong.

“He bought our freedom,” she said softly.

“He bought my soul a little less debt,” Kael rasped, closing his eyes. The image of Valen falling played behind his lids, an eternal monument.

A sound made them both freeze. Not from the camp behind, but from ahead, from the direction of the distant city. A low, resonant boom, like a giant’s drum, echoed across the land. Then another, from a different direction. And another.

Kael forced himself up, peering through a break in the trees towards the distant plains. On the horizon, where the first grey light of dawn kissed the earth, new fires bloomed. Not campfires. Siege fires. And before them, carried on winds thick with new sorceries, great banners unfurled.

To the north, a crimson serpent on a black field—the mark of Sorcerer-King Muro of the Iron Reach. To the south, a golden sun pierced by a silver spear—the sigil of Sorcerer-Queen Lysandra of the Sunfall Marches. More drums answered, more banners emerged from the gloom, a grim constellation of rising powers.

The camp they had fled was now just one small part of a gathering storm. Valen’s final act had not been just for them. It had been a last, desperate warning.

Anya’s breath caught. “Gods of the Deep… they’re all coming.”

Kael remembered Valen’s last words, gasped as he lay dying in the mud, words he’d thought were just the rambling of a broken man. Now they carried the weight of a doomed world.

“The King… he’s not the only one. The Atlas has called them all.”

The artifact in Anya’s arms wasn’t just a key. It was a light. And every monstrous power in the world had just heard its call.
