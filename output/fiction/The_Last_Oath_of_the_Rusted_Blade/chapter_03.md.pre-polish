Chapter 3: The Living Atlas

The fire was a guttering, pathetic thing. It ate the scrub-wood too fast, coughing out thin, acrid smoke that did nothing to push back the immense, star-choked cold of the Wastes night. Kael huddled closer, the chill seeping through his worn leathers and into the old ache of his bones. The shame was a colder companion still, coiled in his gut.

Across the flames, Sister Anya sat motionless, her back rod-straight against a skeletal driftwood log. The heavy, iron-bound book lay on her lap, her hands resting on its cover as if in prayer, or possession. Torvin, their hulking guide, was already snoring, a wet, rhythmic sound from his bedroll near the tethered mule. The silence between Kael and the sister was a vast, unspoken thing, filled with the memory of his clumsy, near-fatal stumble into a sinkhole that afternoon, and the way she’d looked at his rusted blade—not with fear or reverence, but with a librarian’s pity for a damaged text.

“You should sleep,” Anya said, her voice not unkind, just distant. “The Deep Wastes tomorrow will make this seem a garden.”

“Can’t,” Kael grunted. “Teeth.” He nodded towards the darkness beyond their meager circle of light. It was alive with small, skittering sounds, with the dry whisper of wind over ash, and with something else—a low, subsonic thrum that vibrated in the fillings of his teeth.

“Ghoul-wolves,” Torvin rumbled without opening his eyes. “Pack’s been tracking us since dusk. Nothin’ to do but wait. They’re cowards. Fire holds ‘em.”

But the fire was dying. Kael reached for another piece of scrub, his fingers brushing the leather-wrapped hilt of his sword where it lay beside him. It was just weight. Dead iron. He used it to push the wood onto the embers, a gesture that felt like sacrilege and utter practicality all at once.

Anya watched him. “Why carry it,” she asked, “if it will not serve?”

The question, asked so plainly, was a knife in an old wound. “It’s mine,” he said, the words coming out rougher than he intended. “A reminder.”

“Of what? Glory?” Her tone held no mockery, only a profound curiosity that was worse.

“Of the oath I broke,” Kael whispered, the confession torn from him by the desolate night. He said no more. The flames spat, and in the sudden flare, he saw her eyes widen—not at him, but at the darkness behind him.

The sounds stopped.

All of them. The skittering, the wind, even Torvin’s snoring. The silence was a physical pressure on the ears.

Torvin was on his feet in one fluid motion, a hatchet in one hand, a thick-bladed knife in the other. “Up,” he hissed.

Kael scrambled up, his hand closing around the hilt of his blade. It felt as responsive as a brick.

From the ink-black void, they came. Not with a roar, but with a chorus of wet, clicking snarls. Ghoul-wolves. They were emaciated, hairless things, their skin the colour of a week-old bruise, stretched taut over distorted skeletons. Eyes like chips of smoky quartz reflected the dying firelight.
