Chapter 9: The Gates of Aethelgard

Chapter 9: The Gates of Aethelgard

The Wastes ended not with a whimper, but a wall.

One moment they were trudging through the ash-choked badlands, the next they stood before a cliff of seamless, pearl-grey stone that curved away into the haze in both directions, higher than ten men. It wasn’t natural. The surface was smooth as glass, reflecting their own battered, soot-stained faces back at them—a stark contrast to the grandeur it implied.

“It’s… a door,” Anya breathed, her voice hushed with a reverence Kael hadn’t heard since the old chapels of his homeland.

He saw it then. The faintest tracery of lines, thinner than hair, forming a colossal archway in the stone. At its apex, a depression swirled with the pattern of a seven-pointed star. The air here tasted different. Not clean, but empty, as if all sound and magic had been sucked out centuries ago and never returned.

“The Atlas,” Kael said, his own voice too loud in the silence.

Anya unslung the pack with careful hands. The artifact, a disc of bronze and crystal, felt heavier here. It hummed, a vibration that travelled up Kael’s arm and set his teeth on edge. As she lifted it towards the depression, the lines on the wall ignited with a cold, blue-white light. The light didn’t warm the air; it chilled it further. With a sound like a mountain sighing, a seam appeared in the stone, and the titanic doors began to swing inward, moving on mechanisms lost to time.

What lay beyond stole the breath from Kael’s lungs.

Aethelgard was a corpse of a city, preserved in amber of dead magic. Towers of silver-white stone spiraled towards a cavern roof so high it was lost in gloom, illuminated by a ghostly, sourceless radiance that cast no shadows. Bridges of delicate filigree arched between spires, whole and unbroken. Squares paved with mosaics of lapis and jade depicted stars and strange, peaceful beasts. But there was no wind, no rustle of life, not even the scuttle of a rat. The silence was a physical pressure. The air was stale, tasting of dust and ozone.

“It’s beautiful,” Anya whispered, tears cutting clean tracks through the grime on her cheeks.

“It’s a tomb,” Kael corrected, his hand resting on the worn hilt of his rusted blade. The grandeur felt like a taunt. Every perfect line was a reminder of what was lost, of the pride that had undoubtedly caused its fall.

The Atlas pulsed in Anya’s hands, its light now projecting a faint, shimmering path along the main thoroughfare. They followed, their boots echoing with sacrilegious loudness on the pristine stone.

The first gate was a ring of floating, crystalline shards in a circular plaza. The Atlas glowed; the shards hummed and rearranged themselves, forming a shifting pattern of runes. Anya, her scholar’s mind wrestling with the logic of a dead civilization, traced the patterns with her eyes.

“It’s a question,” she murmured. “A philosophical lock. ‘What is the price of peace?’”

Kael stared at the lethal, hovering shards. “Blood. It’s always blood.”

“No,” she said, not looking at him. “That’s the answer of The Blighted Wastes. Theirs is different.” She closed her eyes, thinking of the silent city. “Oblivion. The price is oblivion. Of self. Of memory.”

She spoke the last word in the old tongue, a guttural, final syllable. The shards stilled, turned opaque, and sank gently to the ground, forming a bridge.

They moved faster after that, but the city was vast. As they navigated a hall of statues whose eyes fired beams of searing light—dodging and weaving as Anya frantically aligned reflective plates using the Atlas’s guidance—Kael caught the first sign of pursuit.

A flicker of movement on a high balcony. Not spectral, but solid. Leather and steel. Then the distinctive, sickly green flash of Tel’s battle-sorcery, striking the ground where he’d stood a second before, melting stone to bubbling slag.

“They’re here,” he growled, shoving Anya behind a plinth as another bolt sizzled past.

“The Sorcerer-King’s men? How?”

“They must have tracked us through the caves. Or someone else did.”

The ‘someone else’ announced themselves moments later. From a different spire, a bolt of pure, violent crimson energy lanced down, not at them, but at the position of the Tel forces. The explosion of conflicting magics—acidic green and devouring red—filled the air with a shrieking, corrosive dissonance. A rival sorcerer, playing their own game.

“We’re mice in a crossfire,” Kael spat. “Run!”

The Atlas’s path led them down, into the heart of the city. They descended grand staircases, through libraries with shelves of crystal books that dissolved if touched, past fountains where liquid light hung in frozen, perfect droplets. All the while, the sounds of distant magical conflict echoed through the canyons of stone, a reminder that the outside world, with all its greed and violence, had breached the sanctuary.

Finally, they reached the Archive. It was a dome, its interior a map of the cosmos, planets and stars rendered in gold and floating motes of light. In the center, on a dais of obsidian, rested a single pedestal. Not with a weapon, but with a sphere of what looked like smoked glass, within which a tiny, intricate seed of silver and shadow seemed to twist and turn, though it never moved.

Anya approached, the Atlas now blazing like a small sun. She placed it on the pedestal. The cosmic map above whirled, stars shooting across the dome. Beams of light focused on the sphere, and from it, ghostly images erupted: not of a blade cutting a god, but of a complex, unfolding spell-form, a pattern of such profound emptiness it made Kael’s soul ache. It unwove reality stitch by stitch, not with violence, but with absolute, serene nullification.

“The God-Severance,” Anya read the flowing script that appeared in the air. “It is not a sword, but a seed. Plant it in the fabric of a being, a place, a concept… and it unravels it from existence. This is what they forged. Not to kill a god, but to unmake the very idea of it.”

The horror of it settled on Kael. This wasn’t a tool for war; it was the end of meaning. “And you mean to destroy it?”

“I mean to bury it where no desperate, broken soul will ever find it,” she said, her voice steel. “Starting with the Sorcerer-King.”

A chime, pure and soft, rang through the Archive. From a niche in the wall, a figure emerged. It was humanoid, but wrought of the same pearl-grey stone as the city’s walls, jointed with bands of gold. Its face was serene, androgynous, and its eyes were pools of calm, blue light. It moved with a gentle, whispering sound.

“I am the Steward of the Final Thought,” it spoke, its voice like water over smooth rock. “The seekers have come. The violent ones claw at my gates. Your purpose, seeker?”

It looked at Anya. She stood straight, though she trembled. “To destroy the Seed. To ensure the God-Severance is never used.”

The Steward’s head tilted. Its gaze was a physical weight. “You bear the grief of the world. You understand the cost of forgetting. Your purpose is… pure.” The blue eyes then shifted to Kael. “And you, broken blade? What is your purpose?”

Kael met its gaze. He thought of the oath that bound him to his rusted sword, to his dead brothers, to a code that had crumbled to dust in The Blighted Wastes. He had no grand purpose. Only a person. “I’m here for her.”

The Steward was silent for a long moment. “The vault where the Seed is kept can be opened. The mechanism is simple. It requires a key of intent, forged in oath.”

“We have the Atlas—” Anya began.

“The Atlas is a guide. The key is an oath. A promise so fundamental to a soul’s architecture that its breaking is what broke the world.” The Steward’s hand lifted, one stone finger pointing directly at the hilt of Kael’s sword. “That blade. It is not just steel. It is a testament. A sworn oath, made in earnest, now rusted with regret and failure.”

Kael’s hand tightened on the hilt. He felt the rough, flaking metal bite into his palm.

“The vault responds to truth,” the Steward continued. “To open it, the oath must be made true once more. Not in word, but in essence. You must swear upon it again, knowing all you now know, bearing all you now bear. And you must mean it.”

A thunderous crash echoed from far above. Dust sifted from the dome. The rival sorcerers were getting closer.

“What oath?” Kael’s throat was dry.

“That is for you to remember and to speak. It is the promise that first made you a knight, before the world unmade you. Speak it true, and the path will open. Fail, or speak falsely, and the Archive will seal forever, with you inside.”

The Steward stepped back, becoming one with the wall once more, its blue eyes watching.

Anya looked at him, her face pale. “Kael…”

He walked to the center of the dais, before the pedestal holding the terrible, beautiful Seed. He drew his sword. The rasp of rusted metal was the loudest sound in the world. He looked at it—the notched, corroded blade, the wire-wrapped grip stained with sweat and blood, the worn leather of the scabbard he’d carried for a thousand miles of hell.

He remembered. The sun had been high that day, not the sickly green of Tel’s sun, but the gold of his homeland. The ceremony in the simple stone chapter-house. The smell of incense and oiled mail. His brothers around him, faces young and earnest. The weight of the new sword in his hands, bright and sharp. The words he’d spoken, echoed by a dozen voices.

He opened his mouth. The first word stuck, a shard of memory in his throat. He was not that young man. That man was a fool. That oath had led to ash and betrayal and a field of dead friends.

Another explosion, closer. Shouts now, in the harsh tongue of Tel.

He looked at Anya. She wasn’t looking at the vault, or the Seed. She was looking at him. Her eyes held no demand, only a quiet, devastating faith.

He closed his eyes. He did not think of kings or countries, of codes or glory. He thought of the woman who had pulled him from a ditch, who had trusted him with a world-ending secret, who had seen a monster and called him a man. He thought of standing between her and the darkness, however futile. That was the core of it, wasn’t it? Not the pomp, not the loyalty to a crown, but the simple, brutal choice to stand.

The words came, not in the ringing tones of a young knight, but in the gravelly, worn-out rasp of a survivor. They were the same words, but they were entirely new.

“I swear upon steel and soul to stand between the innocent and the storm. To be a shield for the helpless, a blade for the oppressed. My life before theirs. My honor not in title, but in deed. This I swear, until the world ends or I fall.”

As the last word fell, a warmth bloomed in his hand. He looked down. The rust on his blade was glowing, a deep, inner ember of gold. Flakes of corrosion fell away like black snow, not to reveal shining steel beneath, but something else—a blade of dark, unbreakable alloy, etched with the faint, ghostly lines of his own oath in the old script. It was not a new sword. It was his sword, finally true.

Before him, the floor of the dais shimmered. The obsidian melted away, revealing a narrow staircase spiraling down into a darkness that smelled of cold earth and finality. The vault.

The Steward’s voice washed over them, soft with something like sorrow. “The oath is true. The path is open. The Seed awaits.”

Kael met Anya’s eyes. The sounds of battle were at the Archive doors now—the sizzle of magic, the thud of blades on stone. They were out of time.

He hefted the transformed weight of his sword, feeling its new balance, its terrible promise. “Go,” he said, nodding to the stairs. “Do what you came to do. I’ll hold the door.”

Anya hesitated for only a heartbeat. She touched his arm, a press of fingers that spoke volumes, then snatched the Seed from its pedestal and vanished down the dark stairwell.

Kael turned, setting his boots on the top step, his renewed blade held ready. He looked at the great doors of the Archive, now shuddering under magical assault. He looked at the serene Steward, then back into the descending dark where Anya had gone.

The oath hung in the air around him, no longer a ghost of the past, but a living, breathing thing. He had sworn it again. Now, he had to make it good.
