  "genre": "fantasy",
  "subgenre": "sword and sorcery",
  "premise": "Kael, a disgraced mercenary whose magical sword has rusted shut in its scabbard, is hired for one final, simple job: escort a scholarly nun through the monster-infested Ashen Wastes. The job turns lethal when they discover her 'holy text' is a living atlas to a lost city containing a weapon that could unmake empires, forcing Kael to protect his charge with a blade he can no longer draw from a coalition of sorcerer-kings, ancient automata, and his own former brothers-in-arms.",
  "protagonist": "Kael the Unbound, a once-legendary sellsword now haunted by failure and bound by a magical oath that physically prevents him from drawing his sentient sword, Vellichor, until he fulfills a forgotten vow.",
  "conflict": "To survive the hunt and protect his found family of outcasts, Kael must either find a way to break his oath and draw his rusted blade\u2014risking the wrath of the sword's spirit\u2014or learn to lead and fight without the god-like power that once defined him, all while racing to secure or destroy the city's weapon before the sorcerer-kings claim it.",
  "setting": "The Shattered Realms, a continent littered with the magi-tech ruins of a fallen advanced civilization, now a brutal landscape of warring city-states, primordial wastes, and unstable magical leylines.",
  "tone": "Gritty, fast-paced, and emotionally resonant, blending visceral action and dark sorcery with heartfelt moments of loyalty, sacrifice, and redemption among a band of broken misfits."
