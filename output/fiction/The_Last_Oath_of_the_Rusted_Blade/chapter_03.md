A guttering, pathetic fire danced in a feeble attempt to warm the desolate Wastes night. Acrid scent of charred wood clung to Kael's worn leathers and seeped into the old ache of his bones. Shame coiled in his gut, a colder companion still. He huddled closer, eyes fixed on the flames as they spat and coughed, sending wisps of smoke into the darkness. Flickering light cast eerie shadows on the surrounding rocks, making the very earth seem alive and watching.

Across the flames, Sister Anya sat motionless, her back rod-straight against a skeletal driftwood log. The heavy, iron-bound book lay on her lap, her hands resting on its cover as if in prayer, or possession. Its leather binding creaked softly in the stillness, a sound almost gentle. Torvin, their hulking guide, already snored, a wet, rhythmic sound from his bedroll near the tethered mule. Silence stretched between Kael and the sister, a vast, unspoken thing filled with the memory of his clumsy, near-fatal stumble into a sinkhole that afternoon, and the way she'd looked at his rusted blade—not with fear or reverence, but with a librarian's pity for a damaged text.

Crackling flames cast a warm glow on Kael's dark, weathered face. His deep, piercing brown eyes held a world of pain and regret, a weight he couldn't shake. Firelight danced across his features, highlighting sharp cheekbones and a pointed chin. His small, upturned nose seemed almost fragile against the rugged landscape.

Shadows cast by the rocks writhed and twisted. Air hung heavy with the scent of decay and death, a morbid perfume clinging to everything, a constant reminder of the world's fragile, brutal beauty. A familiar unease churned in Kael's stomach, one he'd grown accustomed to in The Blighted Wastes. It seeped into his bones, a cold, dark presence.

His gaze drifted to the book in Anya's lap, its leather cover embossed with strange, arcane symbols. It radiated an aura of quiet power, both captivating and intimidating. He'd seen it before in the dimly lit recesses of ancient libraries. Said to hold the secrets of the old world, lost to the sands of time, it seemed to whisper secrets he couldn't decipher, secrets that might hold the key to understanding everything.

“Ghoul-wolves,” Torvin rumbled without opening his eyes. “Pack’s been tracking us since dusk. Nothin’ to do but wait. They’re cowards. Fire holds ‘em.” The words were a rough comfort, one Kael clung to like a lifeline. But looking at the flames, he knew it was a lie. The fire was dying. They were running out of time.

Kael reached for another piece of scrub, his fingers brushing the leather-wrapped hilt of his sword where it lay beside him. Just weight. Dead iron. He used it to push the wood onto the embers, a gesture that felt like sacrilege and utter practicality all at once. The metal seemed to absorb the light around it, casting a dark shadow. Anya watched him, her eyes narrowed in a mixture of curiosity and concern.

“Why carry it,” she asked, “if it will not serve?”

The question, asked so plainly, was a knife in an old wound. A pang of shame, long thought buried, twisted inside him. He'd carried the sword since the day he'd broken his oath, his promise to protect the people of The Blighted Wastes. A promise he'd failed to keep. Now the sword was a constant reminder, a physical burden of his own inadequacy, a symbol of the broken oath.

As he spoke, the shadows deepened, alive and watching, waiting for a mistake. Air vibrated with tension, a sense of foreboding hanging over them like a dark cloud. A shiver ran down his spine. He'd thought the past was behind him, but the memories still lingered, haunting him like a ghost.

Anya's eyes held a glimmer of understanding, a hint of compassion. She saw the weight of his shame, the burden of his failure, and yet she remained, a steady presence. For a moment, they just stared, the only sound the heavy breathing of the mule and the distant thrum of the ghoul-wolves.

Then, without a word, Torvin was on his feet, a hatchet in one hand, a thick-bladed knife in the other. His eyes narrowed, face set in a grim expression. He moved with quiet confidence. Kael scrambled up, his hand closing around the hilt of his blade. It felt as responsive as a brick, a cold, dead weight that mocked him.

Shadows writhed and twisted. The air hung thick with the scent of decay, that constant reminder of a fragile, brutal world. Familiar unease churned in Kael's gut, seeping into his bones.

The wolves closed in, their eyes like chips of smoky quartz reflecting the dying firelight, a cold, dead light that seemed to suck the warmth from the air. They were emaciated, hairlessthings, their skin the colour of a week-old bruise, stretched taut over distorted skeletons. Their jaws were open, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth, and their eyes seemed to burn with a fierce, unnatural hunger.

As they approached, Kael felt a sense of dread wash over him, a feeling that he couldn't shake. He'd faced the wolves before, but never like this. Never with the weight of his failure bearing down on him like a physical force. The sword seemed to feel heavier, more oppressive, as if it was a constant reminder of his inadequacy.

Torvin moved forward, his hatchet at the ready. He seemed to be the only one who didn't seem to be afraid, his face set in a grim expression. Kael followed, his hand closing around the hilt of his blade. The metal seemed to absorb the light around it, casting a dark shadow on the ground. The air was heavy with tension, a sense of foreboding that hung over them like a dark cloud.

As they moved, the wolves seemed to close in, their jaws snapping with a fierce, unnatural hunger. Kael felt a sense of dread wash over him, a feeling that he couldn't shake. He'd faced the wolves before, but never like this. Never with the weight of his failure bearing down on him like a physical force.

The wolves were upon them, their jaws snapping with a fierce, unnatural hunger. Kael felt a sense of panic wash over him, a feeling that he couldn't shake. He'd faced the wolves before, but never like this. Never with the weight of his failure bearing down on him like a physical force. The sword seemed to feel heavier, more oppressive, as if it was a constant reminder of his inadequacy.

But as he looked at Anya, he saw something else in her eyes – a glimmer of understanding, a hint of compassion. She seemed to see the weight of his shame, the burden of his failure, and yet she still stood by him, a steady presence in a world that was both beautiful and brutal. For a moment, they just stared at each other, the only sound the heavy breathing of the mule and the distant thrum of the wolves.

Then, in a flash of movement, Torvin was upon the wolves, his hatchet flashing in the dying light. The sound of the blade biting into flesh was a sickening, wet sound, one that seemed to echo through The Blighted Wastes like a death knell. Kael felt a sense of relief wash over him, a feeling that he couldn't shake. The wolves were down, their bodies still and lifeless on the ground.

As they caught their breath, Kael couldn't help but feel a sense of shame. He'd failed to protect them, failed to keep them safe. The weight of his failure seemed to bear down on him like a physical force, a constant reminder of his inadequacy.

The fire crackled and spat, casting a warm glow on the dark, weathered skin of Kael's face. His eyes, a deep, piercing brown, seemed to hold a world of pain and regret, a weight that he couldn't shake. The firelight danced across his features, highlighting the sharp angles of his cheekbones and the sharp, pointed chin. His nose was a small, upturned thing, a feature that seemed almost... fragile, given the rugged landscape that surrounded them.

As they sat in silence, the only sound the heavy breathing of the mule and the distant thrum of the wolves, Kael felt a sense of peace wash over him. It was a fleeting feeling, one that seemed to be snatched away by the harsh realities of The Blighted Wastes. But for a moment, he felt a sense of hope, a feeling that he wasn't alone in this desolate world. He had Anya, and Torvin, and the sword, a constant reminder of his failure, but also a symbol of his strength.

The fire died, plunging them into darkness. The silence was oppressive, a heavy weight that seemed to press down on them. Kael felt a sense of unease wash over him, a feeling that he couldn't shake. The darkness seemed to be alive, a living thing that seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy.

The darkness seemed to stretch on forever, a vast, endless expanse of nothingness. Kael felt a sense of disorientation, a feeling that he couldn't shake. He'd been walking for days, weeks, months, and yet he still felt lost, still felt like he was wandering through a desolate landscape without a purpose.
