# Chapter 12

**Chapter Twelve: The Quiet Flame**  

The rain had stopped, but the air still clung to the dampness of the storm, heavy with the scent of wet earth and pine. Eleanor stood at the edge of the old wooden dock, her bare toes curling over the splintered edge. The lake stretched out before her, dark and still, a mirror for the bruised sky.  

She had come here every morning since the fire.  

The ashes of the house had been cleared away, the blackened timbers hauled off by men who spoke in hushed tones when they thought she couldn’t hear. There was nothing left now but the foundation, a skeletal outline of what had once been her home.  

She closed her eyes and listened to the water lapping against the dock’s pilings. The sound was familiar, a rhythm she had known since childhood. But everything else had changed.  

Behind her, a twig snapped.  

She didn’t turn. She knew it was Daniel. He had been coming here too, ever since the night the flames swallowed everything.  

“You’re up early,” he said, his voice rough with lack of sleep.  

Eleanor exhaled, watching her breath curl in the cold air. “Couldn’t sleep.”  

He came to stand beside her, his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his coat. He was taller than she remembered, his shoulders broader, but his face was still the same—sharp angles, dark eyes that never quite settled.  

They stood in silence for a long time, watching the mist rise off the water.  

“They found the cause,” Daniel said finally.  

Eleanor’s fingers tightened around the edge of her sweater. “And?”  

“Faulty wiring in the attic. Old house. Just… bad luck.”  

She let out a slow breath. Bad luck. That’s what they called it when life burned down around you.  

“You don’t believe that,” she said.  

Daniel didn’t answer right away. He picked up a flat stone from the dock and skipped it across the water. One, two, three jumps before it sank.  

“I don’t know what I believe,” he admitted.  

Eleanor turned to look at him then, really look. There were shadows under his eyes, a tightness in his jaw that hadn’t been there before. He had been the one to pull her out that night, his arms around her as the ceiling collapsed behind them.  

“You saved my life,” she said softly.  

He shook his head. “I just got lucky.”  

“No.” She reached out, her fingers brushing his wrist. “You didn’t have to come back. You didn’t have to risk it.”  

Daniel’s throat worked. “Yes, I did.”  

The words hung between them, heavy as the morning fog.  

She wanted to ask him why. Why he had come back after all these years, why he had stayed when everyone else had left. But she already knew the answer. It was the same reason she had never sold the house, never moved away.  

Some fires never really went out.  

A breeze stirred the trees, sending a shower of droplets from the leaves. Daniel shivered, and without thinking, Eleanor stepped closer, pressing her shoulder against his.  

He didn’t pull away.  

“What now?” he asked.  

She looked out at the lake, at the quiet flame of dawn breaking over the water.  

“We rebuild,” she said.  

And for the first time in a long time, she meant it.
