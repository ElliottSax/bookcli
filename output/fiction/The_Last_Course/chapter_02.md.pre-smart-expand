# Chapter 2: A Recipe for Suspicion

CHAPTER TWO: A RECIPE FOR SUSPICION

The silence in Leo’s apartment was a physical thing, a dough over-proofing in the heat of his own panic. It had been thirty-six hours since Julian Thorne’s death. The police had come and gone from his own doorstep, their questions polite but their eyes like scalpels, dissecting his answers. He’d spent the interim not sleeping, but moving in a tight orbit between his narrow galley kitchen and the fortress of books that lined his living room.

The air smelled of old paper, dust, and the ghost of last night’s desperate attempt to cook something normal—a failed béarnaise that had split, its acrid vinegar note still clinging. He stood before his collection, a sommelier of forgotten meals. Leather-bound, cloth-backed, some with spines so cracked they were held together with butcher’s twine. These were his redemption, his prison. He ran a finger along a row, the parchment and vellum cool against his skin. His hand stopped on a volume the color of dried blood: *The Forme of Cury*, a modern facsimile. Not old enough. He needed the source, the root.

He found it on a high shelf, requiring a wooden step-stool that groaned under his weight. The book was heavy, a slab of history. *Libellus de Arte Coquinaria*, an early 14th-century manuscript, reproduced in full-color facsimile. He’d paid three months’ rent for it years ago, a trophy from his critic days. He carried it to his broad, scarred oak worktable—the only clear surface in the room—and laid it down with the reverence of a priest handling relics.

He opened it. The pages were a riot of sensory overload, even in reproduction. The Latin script was a dense, black thorn-hedge. But it was the illustrations that always stole his breath: illuminated capitals blooming with fantastical beasts, margins crawling with monkeys and jesters, and, most importantly, diagrams of feasts. Peacocks re-dressed in their own iridescent feathers, swans posed as if in flight, intricate subtleties of marzipan and sugar depicting biblical scenes. The colors were jewel-bright: vermilion, lapis lazuli, gold leaf that seemed to swallow the weak afternoon light from his window.

He flipped past “Blankmanger” and “Connynges in Bruet,” his eyes scanning for the dish that had ended Julian Thorne. *Crane roasted with a galentyne sauce…* No. *Hare in talbotace…* No. His finger, smudged with ancient dust, traced down a page. There.

*Porpus in Savce Sawge.*

Porpoise in Savory Sauce. The very dish he’d served to Elara Voss just two weeks ago.

His breath hitched. He hadn’t made the connection immediately. Thorne’s death was a shockwave, but this… this was a pattern forming in the broth, fat rising to the surface. He read the recipe, his lips moving silently over the Middle English. It was a complex, time-intensive process: the porpoise meat first boiled, then roasted on a spit, served with a sauce of its own liver, breadcrumbs, vinegar, and a massive, almost aggressive amount of sage and pepper. A dish of ostentation, meant to showcase wealth and access to exotic, royal-game meat. Elara Voss, the reclusive philanthropist who funded oceanographic research, had requested it specifically. She’d said she wanted to taste “the arrogance of the medieval palate, to understand what we dominate.” Leo had sourced ethically harvested dolphin fish (mahi-mahi), the closest legal equivalent, and worked for two days to perfect the spicing, the unctuous texture of the liver-thickened sauce.

He remembered her dining room, a stark, modern space overlooking the harbor, like the bridge of a ship. She’d eaten in silence, her sharp, birdlike features contemplative. “It tastes of conquest,” she’d said finally, wiping her mouth with a linen napkin. “Salty, iron-rich, spiced to mask the decay of a long journey. You’ve captured it, Chef Vance. The violence of it.”

Now, he reached for his phone, his fingers clumsy. He didn’t need to search her name. The news alert was already there, a silent, digital tombstone. *Philanthropist Elara Voss Found Deceased in Her Home. Foul Play Not Suspected.* The article was bland, citing her age, her heart condition. But the timeline was specific. She had died in her sleep, two nights prior. Approximately twelve hours after his delivery of the Porpoise dish.

Two clients. Two obscure, historically resonant dishes. Two deaths.

The claustrophobia, which had been a low hum, became a scream. The walls of his apartment, lined with the very knowledge that had doomed these people, seemed to lean in. The sumptuous illustrations in the book now looked grotesque, the grinning marginalia mocking him. The rich pigments smelled suddenly like turned earth.

A heavy knock shattered the silence. Not the tentative tap of a neighbor, but the authoritative *thud-thud-thud* of the law.

He opened the door to Detective Mara Chen. She was shorter than he remembered from their first, brief meeting after Thorne’s death, but she filled the doorway with a dense, focused energy. Her dark hair was pulled into a severe bun, and her eyes, the color of black tea, took in his disheveled state, the open tome on the table, in one swift, cataloguing glance. The scent of rain and cold city air clung to her wool coat.

“Mr. Vance. May I come in?”

Her voice was calm, devoid of accusation, which made it all the more terrifying. He stepped aside, the door closing with a definitive click that sealed them in together.

“You’ve heard about Elara Voss,” she stated, not a question. She didn’t remove her coat.

“I read the news,” Leo said, his voice rough from disuse.

“You cooked for her recently. A historical dish. Porpoise.”

“Porpoise in Savory Sauce. Yes. Two weeks ago.”

“Mr. Thorne’s last meal was a… ‘Civey of Hare’?”

“Civey of *Swannes*. A stew of swan.”

A flicker in her eyes. Even she found it arcane. “Two very specific, very unusual meals. Prepared by you. And now both clients are dead.”

Leo felt the old, familiar defensiveness rise, the one that had coiled inside him during the plagiarism scandal. He choked it down. “Their deaths were ruled natural, or accidental. The news said—”

“The initial findings are being revised,” Chen interrupted softly. She moved further into the room, her gaze sweeping over the books. “The autopsies have shown… anomalies. Traces of a compound in their digestive tracts. A synthetic agent, very sophisticated. It mimics natural cardiac failure or, in Mr. Thorne’s case, an acute allergic reaction. It’s untraceable in standard panels. It requires… knowledge.”

“You think I poisoned them.” The words hung in the air, mingling with the dust motes dancing in the gray light.

“I think you had the access. You have a deep, specialized knowledge of rare ingredients, historical preparations, things that could mask or explain unusual flavors or after-effects.” She turned to face him fully. “And you have a motive.”

“I have no motive. My business is ruined if I kill my clients.”

“Your business was criticism. It was ruined once before, publicly, humiliatingly. These people,” she gestured vaguely, encompassing the ghosts of Thorne and Voss, “they represent a world that cast you out. You serve them, but you must also resent them. A disgraced artist, forced to cater to the very elite who now treat him as hired help. It’s a classic narrative, Mr. Vance. The police like classic narratives.”

Her words were a clinical dissection, and they cut because they contained a sliver of truth. He did resent them, sometimes. Their casual power, their ability to buy his expertise like a trinket. But resentment wasn’t murder.

“I didn’t kill them,” he said, the force of his conviction surprising them both. “Someone is using my food. My work. As a… a vehicle.”

“Why? And how? You prepared the meals. You delivered them. Unless you have an idea you’re not sharing.”

His eyes were dragged back to the open manuscript. He walked to it, Chen following silently. He pointed to the recipe for the porpoise. “This. And the swan dish. They’re from the same era. The same culinary tradition. They’re not just random old foods. They’re statements. I didn’t choose them. The clients requested them specifically. What if… what if someone is suggesting these dishes to them? Guiding them to me?”

Chen leaned over the book, her perfume—something clean and citrusy—cutting through the ancient smell. She studied the page, not reading the text, but absorbing its aura. “A suggestion from whom? A mutual acquaintance? A trusted advisor?”

“I don’t know. But look.” His frustration mounting, he began flipping pages, the vellum facsimiles rustling like dry leaves. “This cuisine, it’s not just about sustenance. It’s about power, theology, social order. Every dish at a medieval feast was a symbol. Peacock for immortality. Swan for fidelity and also, because it was royal game, for privilege.” He stopped, his blood running cold. “Porpoise. A sea-creature. In medieval bestiaries, porpoises were sometimes seen as guides for souls to the afterlife.”

Chen was silent for a long moment. “You’re telling me you think a food historian is committing murder-by-proxy with symbolic meals?”

“I’m telling you the connection is *here*,” he insisted, jabbing a finger at the manuscript. “In these books. In this knowledge. And I am the only one cooking from these books. Someone is setting a table, and I’m their unwitting sous-chef.”

Before she could respond, a new sound came from the hallway: the soft *shush* of a paper bag being set down on the floor, followed by retreating footsteps.

Leo and Chen froze, their eyes meeting. In two strides, he was at the door, yanking it open. The hallway was empty. But at his feet was a large, high-quality insulated delivery bag, the kind used by premium catering services. There was no logo. No tag.

“Don’t touch it,” Chen said, her voice low, her hand moving to her hip.

But Leo was already crouching. The bag was cold. He unzipped it. A wave of chilled air, carrying a profoundly familiar and unsettling aroma, washed over him.

Inside, nestled in a nest of gel packs, was a porcelain terrine, flawlessly presented. The meat, pale and finely textured, was arranged in a rich, dark brown sauce, studded with flecks of sage. A sprig of fresh sage was laid artfully across the top. It was a perfect, professional replica of his *Porpus in Savce Sawge*.

And tucked under the lip of the terrine was a small, cream-colored card.

With a trembling hand, Leo pulled it out. The handwriting was an elegant, old-fashioned cursive, in black ink.

*You set the table. I merely clear it.*

He stared at the words, the elegant script blurring. The sensory details of the dish beneath him—the herbal pungency of sage, the meaty, iron-rich scent of the sauce, the cold porcelain seeping into his skin—collided with the terrifying meaning of the note. He wasn’t just a suspect. He was a tool. An integral part of a feast he didn’t understand, where the final course was always death.

Detective Chen, reading the note over his shoulder, let out a soft, sharp breath. The claustrophobia in the hallway was now absolute, the walls of his life closing in to the dimensions of this insulated bag and its grotesque content. The sumptuous had curdled into the sinister.

“Don’t touch anything else,” Chen said, her professional calm finally cracking, revealing a layer of urgent concern. She was already pulling out her phone, calling for forensics. But her eyes were on Leo, seeing him anew. No longer just a person of interest, but a target in a game whose rules were written in medieval Latin and plated as haute cuisine.

Leo remained on his knees, the cold from the terrine leaching up through his bones. The killer wasn’t just framing him. They were communicating. They were thanking him. And the message was clear: the menu was not yet complete.
