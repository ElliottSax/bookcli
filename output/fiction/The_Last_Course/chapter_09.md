# Chapter 9

**Chapter 9: The Weight of Silence**  

The rain had been falling for three days straight, a relentless drumming against the roof of the old farmhouse. Eleanor sat at A high-end, professional kitchen (the primary stage) table, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup, the steam long gone. The house was too quiet—no creaking floorboards, no hum of the radio, just the steady patter of water against glass.  

Across from her, Daniel stared out the window, his shoulders hunched, his hands clasped so tightly his knuckles had gone white. He hadn’t spoken since morning, not since the letter had arrived. It lay between them now, the envelope torn open, its contents folded neatly beside the salt shaker.  

Eleanor cleared her throat. “We should talk about it.”  

Daniel exhaled through his nose, a slow, controlled breath. “Nothing to talk about.”  

“That’s not true.” She reached for the letter, but he moved first, snatching it away.  

“I said we’re not talking about it.” His voice was low, rough.  

Eleanor clenched her jaw. The silence between them had always been a living thing, shifting and breathing, but now it felt suffocating. She wanted to scream, to shake him until he looked at her, until he *saw* her. Instead, she stood, chair scraping against the floor.  

“Fine. I’ll be in the barn.”  

She didn’t wait for a response. The screen door slammed behind her, the sound swallowed by the rain.  

---  

The barn smelled of hay and damp wood, the scent thick in her lungs. Eleanor grabbed a pitchfork and stabbed at a bale, the motion sharp, angry. She had known this would happen—had known from the moment Daniel’s brother, Thomas, had left for the city that it would end like this.  

*Missing. Presumed dead.*  

The words had been typed neatly, clinically, as if they weren’t tearing her husband apart.  

She threw another forkful of hay, her muscles burning. She wanted to cry, to rage, but the tears wouldn’t come. There was only this—the ache in her arms, the sting of sweat in her eyes.  

A shadow moved in the doorway.  

Daniel stood there, rain dripping from his hair, his shirt clinging to his shoulders. He looked at her, really looked at her, for the first time in days.  

“You blame me,” he said.  

Eleanor stilled. “What?”  

“You think if I’d gone after him sooner—”  

“I don’t blame you.” She dropped the pitchfork. “I blame *him*.”  

Daniel flinched.  

“He left,” she continued, voice breaking. “He left, and he didn’t look back, and now—”  

Daniel crossed the space between them in three strides, pulling her into his arms. She stiffened at first, but then his warmth seeped into her, his heartbeat steady against her ear.  

“I should’ve stopped him,” he murmured into her hair.  

Eleanor closed her eyes. “You couldn’t have.”  

For a long moment, they stood there, the rain beating against the roof, the weight of everything unsaid pressing between them.  

Then, softly, Daniel whispered, “What do we do now?”  

Eleanor pulled back, cupping his face in her hands. “We keep going.”  

And for the first time in days, he nodded.  

---  

That night, the rain stopped. The air was thick with the scent of wet earth, the moon a pale sliver behind the clouds. Eleanor lay awake, listening to Daniel’s steady breathing beside her.  

She turned her head, studying the curve of his jaw, the way his lashes cast shadows on his cheeks. He looked younger in sleep, the lines of worry smoothed away.  

Quietly, she slipped out of bed and padded to the window. The fields stretched out before her, silver in the moonlight. Somewhere out there, Thomas was gone—truly gone, this time.  

She pressed her forehead against the cool glass.  

*Keep going.*  

It was the only thing left to do.
