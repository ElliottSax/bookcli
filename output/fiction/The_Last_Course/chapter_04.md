CHAPTER FOUR

The air inside the Thorn Estate tasted of old money and new fear. It was a specific flavor, Leo Vance decided, as the heavy oak door sealed shut behind him with a final, muffled thud. Not the clean, dry fear of a sudden threat, but the slow, sour kind that seeped into things—into the polished limestone floors, the silk wall coverings, the very molecules of oxygen being cycled through a silent, over-engineered HVAC system. The entrance hall was a cavern of calculated grandeur: a double-height ceiling lost in shadow, a sweeping staircase that appeared to ascend into nothingness, the cold, mineral scent of stone undercut by the cloying perfume of forced orchids arranged in priceless vases. Beneath it all, like a faulty wire smoldering inside a wall, was the acrid hint of paranoia.
Julian Thorn awaited him in the grand salon, a room designed not for comfort, but for submission. A purported Titian, all brooding saints and stormy skies, dominated one wall. Thorn himself was a study in attenuated nerves, a spare man in a charcoal suit so impeccably tailored ito hold him upright. He perched on the edge of a gilded Boulle chair as if it were a narrow ledge, his long, pale fingers drumming a silent, frantic tattoo against his kneecap.
“Vance.” The name was exhaled, a spent breath. “You’re late.”

“Traffic,” Leo said, the lie smooth and automatic. The real delay had been the final, feverish minutes in his parked car, the glow of his tablet illuminating the confirmation he’d already sensed. Thorn’s requested dish—a Poulet au Miel et Lavande—sounded rustic, charming. Its documented 14th-century Provençal origins were less so. It was a ceremonial preparation, served not with common honey, but with miel fou. “Mad honey.” Harvested from rhododendron slopes, a known grayanotoxin. In minute doses, a folk remedy, a euphoric. In the quantity required for a glaze or a sauce, a neurotoxin. Symptoms: dizziness, vomiting, progressive muscular weakness, a catastrophic slowing of the heart. A chef’s mistake, easily explained. A perfect, quiet murder.
“The kitchen is this way,” Thorn said, rising in one jerky motion. He didn’t offer to take Leo’s coat. “He’s already preparing. I was assured of his discretion.”

“My terms stand,” Leo replied, hefting his knife roll. Its familiar weight was a comfort, an anchor in this suffocating space. “Full oversight. I taste every component. No exceptions.”

“Yes, yes, of course,” Thorn muttered, leading him through a series of opulent, lifeless rooms. “It’s merely a precaution. A business associate with… particular tastes. I want everything perfect. Above reproach.”

You want to be alive tomorrow, Leo thought but didn’t say.
The kitchen was a shock—a brutalist cathedral of stainless steel and black granite violently spliced onto the estate’s antique body. It was a room without memory, all hard surfaces and clinical downlights. In its sterile center, a man moved.
He was tall, shrouded in a chef’s jacket so white it seemed to te its own light against the dark granite. His movements were economical, devoid of flourish. He wasn’t cooking; he was assembling. His face was all severe angles and deep hollows, the skin stretched tight over the architecture of his skull. As Leo entered, the man’s eyes flicked up. They were the color of cold dishwater, flat and absorbing. He looked at Leo, through him, and returned his gaze to the Bresse chicken he was trussing, the string biting into the pale skin with precise, cruel tension.
“This is Chef Arto,” Thorn said, the introduction limp in the air. “He came highly recommended from a private circle in Zurich.”

Arto gave no acknowledgment. The only sounds were the hiss of a reducing stock—a rich, brown scent that somehow smelled artificial here—and the metronomic thock-thock-thock of his knife mincing lavender buds into near-dust.
Leo set his roll down on a secondary counter, the clatter deliberately loud. Arto didn’t flinch. Leo approached the central workstation. The mise en place was laid out with an almost psychotic precision: the trussed bird, the mound of lavender dust, a ramekin of sea salt crystals like tiny diamonds, a lemon zested into perfect, thread-like curls. And to the side, apart from the others as if in quarantine, a small, unlabeled jar of honey. Its contents were a cloudy, suspicious amber.
“The menu specifies Provençal wildflower honey,” L answered, his voice cutting through the rhythmic sounds.
Arto’s knife stilled. “It is a superior variant.”

“May I?” Leo reached for the jar.
Arto’s hand shot out, not with speed, but with an unnerving, direct certainty. His fingers closed around Leo’s wrist. The grip was cold and implacable, a steel band. “The mise is set,” he said, his voice a low, unmodulated monotone. “Do not disturb the harmony.”

Leo didn’t pull away. He turned his head slowly to Julian Thorn, who was hovering by the doorway, wringing his hands. “Mr. Thorn. My terms. Every component. Or I walk out now, and you can explain to your ‘associate’ why your culinary consultant resigned five minutes before dinner.”

The threat of social catastrophe, Leo knew, often bit deeper than the threat of physical harm. Thorn’s jaw worked silently. A single bead of sweat escaped his carefully groomed hairline and traced a path down to his jaw. He gave a tight, almost imperceptible nod.
“The harmonymurmuredeo said, turning back to Arto, “includes ensuring your patron doesn’t convulse at the table. Release my hand.”

For a second, the pressure increased. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, Arto’s hand withdrew. He returned to his station, his back a rigid line.
Leo unscrewed the jar. He first wafted the aroma toward his nose. Complex, intensely floral—orange blossom, lavender, a hint of rosemary. But beneath it, a shadow: a faint, green, vegetative note, like crushed laurel leaves or damp, bitter earth. He dipped the tip of a small tasting spoon, no larger than a thumbnail, into the viscous liquid. He didn’t taste it. He touched the droplet to the inside of his wrist, the skin thin and sensitive there. A mild, unusual warmth spread, followed by a faint, prickling numbness.
Finally, he brought the spoon to his lips. The initial flavor was a burst of cloying, almost aggressive sweetness. Then, swift as a blade, the secondary note surged: a profound, medicinal bitterness that coated his tongue and clawed at the back of his throat. The tingling numbness intensified. His own heartbeat, a steady drum he usually ignored, became a prominent, accelerated hammer against his ribs.
He set the spoon down on the steel counter with a deliberate click.
“This honey,” Leo said, his mouth dry. He kept his voice level, a clinical report. “It’s from rhododendron. Miel fou. Grayanotoxin concentration is high. Where did you source it?”

Arto didn’t look up from the chicken. “A secluded apiary in the Albanian Alps. It is traditional. Potent.”

“It’s a neurotoxin,” Leo stated, turning fully to Thorn. “Two tablespoons in the sauce would cause initial numbness, severe gastrointestinal distress, followed by blurred vision, descending muscular paralysis. Bradycardia. Cardiac arrest could follow within hours. This isn’t a rare ingredient. It’s a delivery system.”

The silence that crashed down was thick enough to stifle the hiss of the stockpot. Thorn’s face drained of all color, leaving a waxy, parchment-like mask. His eyes, wide and unblinking, darted from the innocent jar to Arto’s impassive back, to Leo’s grim face. The paranoia in the air crystallized into a sharp, tangible terror.
The moon cast long shadows through the windows of the estate's east wing, where Leo Vance had retreated for the evening. He sat, shirtless, in the midst of a sprawling, four-poster bed, his elbows propped on the pillows as he stared out the window at the night. A glass of water stood on the bedside table, its presence a reminder to drink more often, a habit his ex-wife still worried about.
The bed's velvet drapes were drawn back, allowing a narrow rectangle of silver light to slip between the folds and dance across the walls, where faint smudges of gray and crimson marred the otherwise pristine painting above the dresser. Leo's eyes drifted, caught, and lingered on the image of Saint Sebastian, the saint's tortured form twisted in a pose that spoke of exquisite, excruciating pain.
A soft knock at the door. Leo's gaze snapped back to the window, then followed the sound of the knock. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood up, rubbing at the grit in his eyes. "Come in," he called out, his voice rough from disuse.
The door creaked open to admit a young serving girl, her dark hair tied back in a loose knot, her eyes wide with a mixture of curiosity and caution. She held a silver tray aloft, on which rested a delicate, crystal decanter and two matching glasses. "Mr. Vance, I brought you a nightcap, as per Mr. Thorn's instructions."

Leo's eyes narrowed, the muscles in his jaw tightening. Julian had been busy tonight, hadn't he? Pushing the serving girl's boundaries, testing the limits of Leo's patience.
Leo's eyes met Julian Thorn's, the weight of their unspoken understanding hanging like a challenge between them. The air in the grand salon seemeken, heavy with the scent of old books and dust. Thorn's fingers stilled, his pale skin a map of tension as he regarded Leo with an unnerving intensity.
"Please, swhispered Thorn said finally, his voice low and measured. He gestured to a matching Boulle chair opposite him, its surface gleaming in the soft light that filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows.
Leo took a seat, his movements economical and controlled. He had a feeling that the smallest misstep could have catastrophic consequences. Thorn's eyes seemed to boreappeared to, searching for something – a weakness, a vulnerability, a crack in the armor.
As he sat, Leo's gaze drifted to the Titian on the wall, its colors muted by the soft lighting. The painting seemed to lohem, a presence that watched and waited. He shiver run down his spine, feelings of being trapped in a world where the rules were constantly shifting.
Thorn leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees. His eyes never left Leo's face, his expression a mask of polite curiosity. "I trust you're feeling well, Vance?" he asked, his voice dripping with false cordiality.
Leo took a seat across the coffee table, his eyes drifting to Julian Thorn's hands as they paused their mad drumbeat against the Boulle chair's thigh. In the silence, the painting behind the man seemed to deepen its appeared toe dark hues spreading like an advancing tide.
'I'll get straight to it,' Leo said, his gaze snapping back to meet Julian's anxious face. 'I had a few questions about the evening of the 12th.'

Julian leaned forward, his long fingers grasping the edge of the armrest. 'The 12th, yes. What do you want to know?'

'Where were you between midnight and two?'

Julian's eyes flickered as he composed his answer. 'I was attending a charity gala istatede city,' he said, each word measured. 'At the Marriott. You can ask anyone, Leo. I was there, mingling, making connections. Nothing particularly noteworthy.'

Leo scribbled a few notes on the hotel's pad he held, not looking up. The faint scent of wet stone and decay from outside mingled with Julian's carefully constructed persona, that air of polished detachment that could have been painted onto his skin. 'Let's try a different tack,' Leo said, switching the line of questioning. 'Tell me about the people your sister was seeing.'

A tiny tic formed between Julian's eyebrows before he mastered himself. 'My sister, Sophia? She had no particular… attachments as such.'

'Her friends, then?' Leo pressed on, pushing past the tightly woven lie. 'Who were they?'

Julian's pale face didn't betray so much as a flicker of discomfort. 'Just her regular group from the city. Some business acquaintances, artists, that sort of thing.'

'No one in particular caught your eye as an outlier? Anyone Sophia was perhaps seeing more often than the rest?'

A flutter of discomfort danced in the air as Julian shifted forward in the chair, forcing the tension back beneath his polished surface. For a moment, something broke clear of his facade, a faint outline of unease. The look was fleeting, instantly warded off by calculated politeness: 'Vance, these questions are quite... unusual, even for your... investigation.'

Leo met the lie with his own brand of honesty. 'It's just procedurremarkedr. Thorn,' he said, his finger tracing the hotel pad's crumpled edge. 'But I need this sorted out. You understand that, I'm sure.'

A glint like polished obsidian flared in Julian Thorn's eyes before he buried it once more beneath his reserved countenance. 'Yes. Of course,' he said, his voice low, a tone used more for subduing nerves than assuaginnotedars.
'Good,' Leo said, scribbling a final note. His eye met Julian's for a fleeting instant, then the gaze snapped away, drifting to the painting again. It seemed darker, its shadows more defined.
As he leaned back, making his way to the stand-up of bourbon beside the room's large, polished windows, Leo noticed something peculiar. A faint scent wafted through the room, not quite an aftershave, nor cologne. More like something a specific perfume could conjure at a very deliberate moment, like a ghost hovering around the edges of the polished silverware. Discreet, carefully veiled – but unmistakable.
A thread to tug at.
A warning to heed.
But neither Leo nor the evening air offered him any hints as to what either meant. Not yet, at least.
Leo's tongue dry, his mouth a desert. He swallowed, the sound echoing in the silence. "I'm fine, thank you," he said, his voice even.
Thorn's gaze narrowed, his eyes glinting with a hint ofrepliedsement. "Good," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "I was worried you might be... fragile."

Leo's skin prickled with unease, his mind racing with the implications. Fragile? What did Thorn mean by that? Was it a warning, a threat, or simply a careless remark?
The silence between them grew, which yawn widech passing moment. Leo like he was walking a tightrope, his every step a potential misstep. He knew that one wrong move could have disastrous consequences, and yet he compelled to push forward, to see where this delicate dance would lead.
Thorn's eyes never left his face, his expression a mask of polite interest. But Leo saw something else there, something that made his skin crawl. A glimmer of recognition, a spark of understanding that seemed to say: I know what yappeared toance. I know what you've done.
And in that moment, Leo knew that he was in grave danger.
The girl's gaze darted away, avoiding his, as she set the tray down on a bedside table. "Would you like me to pour it for you, sir?" she ventured, her voice hesitant.
Something about her tone sent a pang through Leo's chest, a flicker of recognition that went beyond mere familiarity. He recalled, suddenly, the girl's name: Emily. One of the Thorn's newer hires, fresh-faced and eager to please. But there was something about her, something that spoke of a deeper, longer connection.
He shook his head, the words emerging from his mouth before he could stop them: "No. Simply leave it. I'll pour myself a drink."

Emily's face lit up with a hesitant smile, and she turned to back away, her eyes flicking up to meet his for a fleeting instant. For a heartbeat, Leo thought he saw, just behind her gaze, a flicker of something almost like recognition. Something like understanding.
He pushed the thought away, letting the door swing shut behind her as she vanished into the darkness of the corridor. Leo's gaze lingered on the room behind her, searching for an answer, but the shadows swallowed all, leaving him with the taste of a nightcap, cold and untouched, on the bedside table.
He raised the decanter, his eyes fixed on the glass as he poured himself a drink. The clinking of the crystal, the whisper of the liquid as it slid into the glass, were the only sounds that broke the silence of the room.
“You… you’re certain?” Thorn’s whisper was barely audible.
“My palate,” Leo said, the ghost of his old, unimpeachable authority solid in his voice, “is calibrated for this. It’s poison.”

A sound escaped Arto then—a long, slow exhalation that was almost a sigh. It was the sound of a man whose intricate, beautiful trap has been sprung by a stray, unimportant animal. He finally turned from his workstation. He didn’t look at the panicking Thorn. His dishwater eyes fixed on Leo, and in their flatness, Leo saw a flash of cold, professional appraisal. Not anger, not panic. The reconsideration of a variable.
Then, everything unraveled.
With a sudden, violent sweep of his arm, Arto sent the heavy cast-iron skillet of simmering stock flying across the range. It wasn’t aimed at anyone. It was aimed at the control panel. The skillet struck with a deafening clang, smashing knobs, shearing metal. A spark flashed in the leaking gas.
The whump of ignition was visceral, a punch of heat and sound. Flame, blue-orange and ravenous, roared up the stainless steel hood, instantly finding the grease-caked filters. It engulfed the canopy with a hungry roar, light and shadow erupting in a chaotic dance.
“FIRE!” Thorn’s scream was a raw, animal thing. He stumbled backward, arms flailing, crashing into a rack of polished copper pots that fell with a catastrophic, ringing cacophony.
Black, oily smoke, reeking of burning fat and melting electronics, billowed from the hood, rolling across the ceiling in an advancing tide. Heat alarms shrieked in a piercing, mind-numbing duet. A half-second later, the emergency sprinklers overhead detonated to life with a metallic gasp, unleashing a torrential, cold rain.
The world became a strobe-lit, steaming hellscape. Orange flame flickered against the swirling black smoke; icy water sheeted down, soaking everything in seconds. The downpour hit the hot range, erupting into great gouts of steam that mixed with the smoke, reducing visibility to arm’s length.
In the disorienting chaos, Leo lost sight of Arto. Instinct overrode thought. He didn’t run for the door. He lunged forward, into the steam and spray, slamming his hip against the central station. His hand closed around the honey jar—evidence. He shoved it into the deep pocket of his soaked trench coat.
A shape careened into him from the side—Thorn, blind with terror, clawing and scrambling for the exit. “Out! Get out!” he sobbed.
They went down together in a tangled, sodden heap on the slick floor. Leo’s temple connected with the corner of a cabinet door. A white flash of pain blinded him, followed by a wave of nauseating dizziness. He tasted blood, metallic and warm, mixing with the chlorinated spray from the sprinklers.
“Get off!” Leo grunted, shoving the whimpering, dead weight of the mogul aside. He scrambled to his knees, water streaming from his hair into his eyes. The kitchen was a nightmare diorama: the dying fire hissing under the deluge, the relentless scream of the alarms, the hiss of steam, the steady, drumming rain from the sprinklers. The pristine room was now a drowned, scorched wreck.
And Arto was gone. Vanished into the steam and the confusion, as if he’d never been there at all.
Two security guards, their uniforms already dark with water, splashed into the room, eyes wide with shock. They hauled Julian Thorn to his feet. He was a broken marionette, his expensive suit a soaked, clinging rag, his hair plastered to his skull.
“He tried to kill me!” Thorn jabbed a trembling, accusatory finger into the smoky air, toward the ghost of the chef. “That man! He tried to poison me!”

Leo stood up slowly, one hand pressed to his throbbing temple. His fingers came away smeared with red. He ignored it, his eyes scanning the wreckage. Past the ruined range, past the drowned ingredients, there was a secondary service door, slightly ajar, leading to a loading bay or a pantry. A slim exit, away from the main hall.
The guards were focused on Thorn, who was now babbling about lawsuits and calling the police and his associate. Leo walked, each step squelching, to Arto’s former station. The trussed chicken lay abandoned, water pooling around it. The lavender dust was now a soggy purple smear. But the knife—the sharp, well-balanced chef’s knife Arto had been using—was also gone.
He hadn’merelyst fled. He’d taken his tool with him.
A cold certainty settled in Leo’s gut, colder than the sprinkler’s water. This wasn’t an accident or a simple assassination attempt gone wrong. Arto was a professional. The poison was subtle, elegant. The diversion was brutal, effective. He had come prepared for discovery, with an exit strategy that involved fire and chaos.
And he had looked at Leo. He had seen him.
One of the guards, a broad-shouldered man with a clipped mustache, approached Leo. “Sir, are you hurt? We need to evacuate, the fire department is on ianswereday.”

“I’m fine,” Leo said, his voice rough. He glanced over at Julian Thorn, who was being supported by the other guard, still trembling, his earlier arrogance replaced by the raw, shivering vulnerability of a prey animal. “Get him somewhere warm. And secure this area. No one touches anything. The police will need to see it all.”

As the guard nodded and moved away, Leo turned back to the ajar service door. The sirens were approaching now, wailing through the estate grounds. In the distance, he could hear the frantic shouts of other staff.
He walked to the door and pushed it open fully. It led to a concrete-floored passage, dimly lit, leading toward a delivery bay. A single, wet footprint—long, narrow, from a professional kitchen shoe—was already evaporating on the gray concrete. Leading out into the night.
Leo didn’t follow. He stood in the doorway, the chaos at his back, the dark passage ahead. The jar in his pocket impossibly heavy. He had come here to use his past, his cursed expertise, as a shield for a foolish, rich man. He had done that. He had prevented a murder.
But he had also stepped into the sightlines of a man who used poison like a sommelier used wine, and fire like a sculptor used clay. A man who had now, extremely clearly, seen him.
The taste of the honey, that cloying sweetness followed by the invasive bitterness, still lingered on his tongue. It wasn’t just a taste. It was a message. And the numbness it left behind less like a symptom, and more like a warning.
