The paper inside was thick, the ink faded to a sepia whisper. Opening it to a random page, the recipe for *pottage of capons* stared back, the Latin letters slanting like drunken monks. He could read it, of course. The language of his craft was memorized. But this wasn’t about translation. It was about the weight of the words, the way the ink had bled into the parchment, the way the edges had been nibbled by time. It was about the silence that had followed him back from the moor, a silence that now filled his small apartment above the Thornfield kitchens, thick and suffocating as wool.
The burial had been a defiance, but defiance left a vacuum. In the absence of action, the mind rushed in. He saw Julian Thorne’s face again—not the public, charming mask, but the private, petulant one he’d glimpsed when a sauce was deemed imperfect. He saw the photographs the detectives had left on his table, their glossy surfaces reflecting the overhead light: Julian’s car, the ditch, the grim-faced officers. They had been polite, so polite, but their eyes had catalogued everything—the knives on the magnetic strip, the professional set of his shoulders, the absence of an alibi for a man who lived alone.
*He needed to cook.*

Closing the book, he saw the rain had stopped. The world outside his window was a study in monochrome: wet slate roofs, leaden sky, the distant moor a smudge of charcoal. Absolute silence filled the room, a vacuum broken only by the faint, persistent hum of the refrigerator and the creak of the building settling into its bones. His own breath came shallow and quick, a discordant rhythm in the stillness. He placed a hand flat on the ancient cookbook, as if to draw steadiness from it, but only a cold, cellular thrum of history.
The kitchen was a small, efficient cell dominated by a professional-grade gas range and dark, cool stone countertops. It was an extension of his mind, a place where chaos could be rendered into perfect, logical order. Moving through it with the precision of a man who has done this ten thousand times, he opened the refrigerator. Harsh, clinical light fell on the ingredients within: a carton of brown eggs, a pint of cream, a block of butter wrapped in parchment. The light also fell on the absence, on the ghost of those photographs now stored in a drawer. The face in them had been expectant, arrogant, forever frozen in mid-demand.
The refrigerator door closed with a soft, definitive *thump*. The ingredients weren’t necessary; he knew them by heart. Their simplicity was the point. This was not about creation, but about calibration. A resetting of internal clocks. A proof of function.
Work began. The motions were a liturgy, a dance performed in sacred isolation. An egg, its shell cool and faintly gritty, cracked one-handed against the rim of a porcelain bowl. The yolk fell, a perfect solar orb, into the nest of the white. Another followed. They were the colour of late afternoon sun, these Thornfield eggs, rich and vital. Cream, thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, poured in a slow, viscous stream. Butter, a pale, generous knob, waited on the side. He whisked, the wires singing a soft, metallic song against the porcelain, marrying the elements into something smooth, pale, and promising.
A taste from the tip of a finger confirmed it was good. It was right. It was baseline.
The mixture poured into a heavy copper pan. The gas flame hissed to life, a blue corona of heat. Butter sizzled, surrendering its nutty fragrance. The cream bubbled, lazy and thick. He stirred with a wooden spoon, its curve worn smooth by his palm, controlling the heat with an almost telepathic sense. Too fast and it would scramble, a vulgar curdling. Too slow and it would languish. He sought the precise moment of transformation. The custard thickened, its colour deepening from pale gold to a warm, buttery primrose. Another taste. Perfection. Not a flavour, but a state of being.
Off went the heat. The custard cooled on the stone, its surface forming a skin he would later press away. He stood over it, watching the last lazy bubbles sigh and pop. Another taste, once it had settled. It remained perfect. It was an island of certainty in a sea of questions.
Into a tiny, plain mold it went, then into the refrigerator. The latch clicked. He waited.
Absolute silence in the apartment. Only the faint, persistent hum of the refrigerator, a mechanical digestion. His breath, still shallow and quick. He leaned against the counter, the stone leaching cold through his shirt. He saw Mara’s face in the gloom of the rowan copse, set and solemn as they buried the swan. *Players now.* The word echoed. What were the rules of a game you never meant to join? The police were one piece. Silas Vane, or the specter of him, was another. Julian’s world—all money and carelessness—was the board itself.
He waited. Time stretched, elastic and thin.
Cool now, the custard came free of the mold with a soft, sucking sigh. He placed it on a plain white plate. It was a simple thing, a small, round, unadorned cake the colour of old ivory. Perfect.
A taste confirmed it. The texture was sublime, a velvet dissolution on the tongue. The flavour was pure, rich, and silent. It said nothing, demanded nothing. It simply *was*.
The clock on the oven read 11:47 PM. A profound tiredness pressed down on him, a weight in his marrow. Hunger, sharp and hollow, gnawed beneath it. They were different sensations, but in that moment, they were inseparable—a yawning need for sustenance and a deep craving for oblivion.
He ate the custard. It was perfect. It filled his mouth but not the hollow space behind his ribs.
The clock read 12:23 AM. Tired. Hungry. The perfect custard was gone. The plate, clean, sat accusingly on the counter. The silence was no longer empty; it was now populated with whispers. *Whispered deals in steamy kitchens. Cars after midnight.* He had buried Silas Vane’s gift, but the man’s methods, the survival instincts, they were seeping back in. He assessed threats like ingredients: which were volatile, which could be combined, which needed to be kept separate.
Later still. 1:11 AM. Tired. Hungry. The apartment smaller, the walls closer. He opened the refrigerator again. The light was a shock. There sat the components for another custard, identical, endless. He could repeat the ritual. He could make another island of perfection. But the thought was repulsive. It was a loop, a trap of his own devising.
He looked at the clock again. It was later. He was tired. He was hungry. The hunger wasn’t for cream and eggs.
Later. Tired. Hungry.
He paced the short length of the living area, his shadow looming and shrinking on the walls. He thought of the book, the *Liber Magorum*. Elara’s revelation had been a spark in the dark, a thread leading out of the labyrinth of the present and into the mysteries of the past. It cleaner. Safer. A problem of scholarship, not of survival. He stopped, his gaze landing on the folder where he kept her notes and the photographs of the manuscript.
He ate the last spoonful of custard from the plate, a final, automatic gesture. It was perfect. It meant nothing.
He looked at the clock. 2:05 AM. The deepest part of the night, where thoughts unravel. He was a chef who had served a dead man. He was a fugitive who had buried a swan. He was a man with a knife in his pocket and a secret in the ground. The game was on, and the first move had been a burial. The next move required not ritual, but strategy. Not perfection, but cunning.
He was tired.
He was so terribly hungry.
He glanced at the folder, then at the dark window, his own ghostly reflection superimposed on the blackness. The hunger, he realized, was for the game itself. To move. To act. To stop being a piece and start being a player in truth. He turned from the window, leaving the clean plate on the counter, and reached not for the eggs, but for the folder. The night was not for cooking, but for planning. The custard had done its job; it had calibrated him back to a cold, clear focus. The silence now was not oppressive, but expectant. He sat down at the table, the photograph of the ornate manuscript page glowing in the lamplight as he drew it close, seeking answers, and perhaps a weapon, in the graceful, dancing letters of a drunken monk’s Latin.
