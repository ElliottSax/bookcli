The paper inside was thick, the ink faded to a sepia whisper. Opening it to a random page, the recipe for *pottage of capons* stared back, the Latin letters slanting like drunken monks. He could read it, of course. The language of his craft was memorized. But this wasn’t about translation. It was about the weight of the words, the way the ink had bled into the parchment, the way the edges had been nibbled by time.

Closing the book revealed the rain had stopped. Absolute silence filled the room, a vacuum broken only by the faint, persistent hum of the refrigerator and the creak of the building settling. His own breath came shallow and quick.

He needed to cook.

A small, efficient kitchen was dominated by a professional-grade gas range and dark, cool stone countertops. Moving through it with the precision of a man who has done this a thousand times, he opened the refrigerator. Harsh, clinical light fell on the ingredients: eggs, cream, butter. On the absence of Julian Thorne’s face, the way it had looked at the dinner, the way it had looked in the photographs the police had shown him.

The refrigerator door closed. The ingredients weren’t necessary; he knew them by heart.

Work began. The motions were familiar, a dance performed countless times. Eggs cracked into a bowl, the yolks bright against the white. Cream and butter followed. Whisking them together thickened the mixture, its color deepening. A taste confirmed it was good. It was right.

The mixture poured into a pan. Butter sizzled, cream bubbled. A steady stir controlled the heat as the custard thickened, its color changing. Another taste. Perfection.

Off went the heat. The custard cooled. Another taste confirmed it remained perfect.

Into a mold it went, then into the refrigerator. He waited.

Absolute silence in the apartment. Only the faint, persistent hum of the refrigerator. His breath, shallow and quick.

He waited.

Cool now, the custard came free of the mold. Placed on a plate, it was a simple thing, a small, round cake. Perfect.

A taste confirmed it.

The clock read late. Tiredness and hunger pressed in.
