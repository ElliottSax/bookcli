 s. The paper inside was thick, the ink faded to a sepia whisper. He opened it to a random page. The recipe for *pottage of capons* stared back at him, the Latin letters slanting like drunken monks. He could read it, of course. He’d memorized the language of his craft. But this wasn’t about translation. It was about the weight of the words, the way the ink had bled into the parchment, the way the edges had been nibbled by time.

He closed the book. The rain outside had stopped. The silence in the room was absolute, a vacuum. He could hear the faint, persistent hum of the refrigerator, the creak of the building settling. He could hear his own breath, shallow and quick.

He needed to cook.

The kitchen was a small, efficient space. The stove was a professional-grade gas range, the countertops a dark, cool stone. He moved through the space with the precision of a man who has done this a thousand times. He opened the refrigerator. The light inside was harsh, clinical. He saw the ingredients he needed: the eggs, the cream, the butter. He saw the absence of Julian Thorne’s face, the way it had looked at the dinner, the way it had looked in the photographs the police had shown him.

He closed the refrigerator. He didn’t need to see the ingredients. He knew them by heart.

He began to work. The motions were familiar, a dance he’d performed countless times. He cracked the eggs into a bowl, the yolks bright against the white. He added the cream, the butter. He whisked them together, the mixture thickening, the color deepening. He tasted it. It was good. It was right.

He poured the mixture into a pan. The butter sizzled, the cream bubbled. He stirred it, the motion steady, the heat controlled. He watched the custard thicken, the color change. He tasted it again. It was perfect.

He turned off the heat. He let the custard cool. He tasted it again. It was still perfect.

He poured the custard into a mold. He placed the mold in the refrigerator. He waited.

The silence in the apartment was absolute. The only sound was the faint, persistent hum of the refrigerator. He could hear his own breath, shallow and quick.

He waited.

The custard was cool. He removed it from the mold. He placed it on a plate. He looked at it. It was a simple thing, a small, round cake. It was perfect.

He tasted it. It was perfect.
