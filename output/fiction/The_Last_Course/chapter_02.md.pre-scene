Chapter 2: A Recipe for Suspicion

The silence in Leo’s apartment was a physical thing, a dough over-proofing in the heat of his own panic. It pressed against his eardrums, a low-frequency hum beneath the sporadic patter of rain on the single west-facing window. It had been thirty-six hours since Julian Thorne’s death. The police had come and gone from his own doorstep, their questions polite but their eyes like scalpels, dissecting his answers. The echo of their shoes on the hallway’s terrazzo floor still seemed to linger. He’d spent the interim not sleeping, but moving in a tight, compulsive orbit between his narrow galley kitchen and the fortress of books that lined his living room, his socks whispering over floorboards worn smooth by a century of other anxious tenants.

The air smelled of old paper, dust, and the ghost of last night’s desperate attempt to cook something normal—a failed béarnaise that had split, its acrid vinegar note still clinging to the dishcloth crumpled in the sink. Beneath it was the deeper, muskier scent of leather bindings and the faint, sweet decay of aging glue. He stood before his collection, a sommelier of forgotten meals. Leather-bound, cloth-backed, some with spines so cracked they were held together with butcher’s twine. These were his redemption, his prison. He ran a finger along a row, the parchment and vellum cool and slightly gritty against his skin. His hand stopped on a volume the color of dried blood: The Forme of Cury, a modern facsimile. Not old enough. The thought was a rasp in his mind. He needed the source, the root, the thing itself. He needed to see the stain of the original.

He found it on a high shelf, requiring a wooden step-stool that groaned under his weight, a sound like a ship’s timber straining. The book was heavy, a slab of history. Libellus de Arte Coquinaria, an early 14th-century manuscript, reproduced in full-color facsimile. He’d paid three months’ rent for it years ago, a trophy from his critic days, a thing he’d bought to prove he understood grandeur, not just technique. He carried it to his broad, scarred oak worktable—the only clear surface in the room, its wood stained with rings of wine, oil, and regret—and laid it down with the reverence of a priest handling relics. A fine cloud of dust, golden in the thin afternoon light, puffed from its edges.

The brass clasp was cool. He lifted it, and the book exhaled a dusty, papery sigh. His fingers, usually steady, trembled slightly as he eased the cover open. A dry, protesting creak echoed in the quiet room.

He leaned in, his shoulders hunching forward as if pulled. The pages weren't just seen; they pressed against his eyes. The Latin text wasn't merely black, but a furious, spiked wall, each letter dug into the vellum with a vengeful hand. He blinked, his own breath catching in his throat.

Then, the beasts. A dragon, coiled within the curve of a 'D', glared with a tiny eye of emerald green. His index finger hovered above it, not daring to touch. In the margins, a painted monkey leered, a half-peeled fig in its claw, and a jester’s crimson tongue seemed to waggle as the page settled. But his gaze skipped, searched, and finally locked.

There. A peacock, its fan a hundred shimmering eyes, lay resurrected in full plumage on a platter. A swan, sculpted from sugar, arched its neck over a parsley sea. His lips parted, a silent, hungry shape. He traced the air above a marzipan Jerusalem, the gold leaf on its towers drinking the pale window-light and glowing with a faint, warm thrum he could almost feel on his skin. The room faded. There was only the slow, deep pull of his inhalation, the book’s jeweled colors painting his still face.

He flipped past “Blankmanger” and “Connynges in Bruet,” the pages whispering like old leaves, his eyes scanning for the dish that had ended Julian Thorne. Crane roasted with a galentyne sauce… No. Hare in talbotace… No. His finger, smudged with ancient dust and the salt of his own skin, traced down a page. The parchment texture was rough, simulating vellum. There.

Porpus in Savce Sawge.

Porpoise in Savory Sauce. The very dish he’d served to Elara Voss just two weeks ago.

His breath hitched, a sharp, papery sound in the quiet room. He hadn’t made the connection immediately. Thorne’s death was a shockwave, a slammed door, but this… this was a pattern forming in the cooling broth, fat rising to the surface in iridescent, suspicious swirls. He read the recipe, his lips moving silently over the Middle English, tasting the archaic syllables. It was a complex, time-intensive process: the porpoise meat first boiled in seawater and vinegar, then roasted on a spit until the skin crackled, served with a sauce of its own liver pounded to a paste, breadcrumbs fried in rendered fat, more vinegar, and a massive, almost aggressive amount of sage and long pepper. A dish of ostentation, meant to showcase wealth and access to exotic, royal-game meat. Elara Voss, the reclusive philanthropist who funded oceanographic research, had requested it specifically. She’d said she wanted to taste “the arrogance of the medieval palate, to understand what we dominate.” Her voice had been dry, precise, a scalpel making an incision. Leo had sourced ethically harvested dolphin fish (mahi-mahi), the closest legal equivalent, its flesh firm and blood-red when raw, and worked for two days to perfect the spicing, the unctuous, faintly metallic texture of the liver-thickened sauce.

He remembered her dining room, a stark, modern space overlooking the harbor, all cold steel and glass like the bridge of a ship. The only smell had been the food and the faint, clean sting of ozone from an air purifier. She’d eaten in silence, her sharp, birdlike features contemplative, her knife scraping faintly against the porcelain. “It tastes of conquest,” she’d said finally, wiping her mouth with a linen napkin so white it hurt to look at. “Salty, iron-rich, spiced to mask the decay of a long journey. You’ve captured it, Chef Vance. The violence of it.” She hadn’t smiled.

Now, he reached for his phone, his fingers clumsy, cold. He didn’t need to search her name. The news alert was already there, a silent, digital tombstone glowing in his palm. Philanthropist Elara Voss Found Deceased in Her Home. Foul Play Not Suspected. The article was bland, citing her age, her heart condition. But the timeline was specific. She had died in her sleep, two nights prior. Approximately twelve hours after his delivery of the Porpoise dish. He imagined the remains of the meal, the sauce congealed in its dish, waiting in her pristine kitchen.

Two clients. Two obscure, historically resonant dishes. Two deaths.

The claustrophobia, which had been a low hum, became a scream in his bones. The walls of his apartment, lined with the very knowledge that had doomed these people, seemed to lean in, the shelves bowing under the weight of centuries. The sumptuous illustrations in the open book now looked grotesque, the grinning marginalia mocking him. The rich pigments smelled suddenly like turned earth and old blood. The gold leaf winked at him, a conspirator’s eye.

A heavy knock shattered the silence. Not the tentative tap of a neighbor, but the authoritative thud-thud-thud of the law, wood against wood, a sound that vibrated through the floorboards and up his spine.

For three heartbeats, Leo stood frozen, the phone a dead weight in his hand. The knock came again, harder. He closed the book, the whump of the cover final. He walked to the door, each step an effort, and opened it to Detective Mara Chen.

She was shorter than he remembered from their first, brief meeting after Thorne’s death, but she filled the doorway with a dense, focused energy, like a stone dropped into still water. Her dark hair was pulled into a severe bun that pulled the skin taut at her temples. Her eyes, the color of black tea steeped too long, took in his disheveled state—the rumpled henley, the shadow of beard, the open tome on the table—in one swift, cataloguing glance. The scent of rain and cold city air clung to her wool coat, a damp, mineral smell that invaded the apartment’s cloistered warmth. A drop of water clung to the lobe of her ear.

“Mr. Vance. May I come in?”

Her voice was calm, devoid of accusation, which made it all the more terrifying. It was the voice of someone who had all the time in the world to wait for the truth to spoil. He stepped aside, a stiff, mechanical movement. The door closed with a definitive click that sealed them in together, muting the distant city sounds into a vague rumble.

“You’ve heard about Elara Voss,” she stated, not a question. She didn’t remove her coat, just unbuttoned it, her movements economical. She stood with her weight evenly distributed, ready.

“I read the news,” Leo said, his voice rough from disuse, the words scraping out.

“You cooked for her recently. A historical dish. Porpoise.” She didn’t consult a notebook. The facts were already arranged in her mind.

“Porpoise in Savory Sauce. Porpus in Savce Sawge. Yes. Two weeks ago.” He heard the pedantry in his own voice, the critic’s reflex to correct, to specify, and winced inwardly.

“Mr. Thorne’s last meal was a… ‘Civey of Hare’?” She let the strange term hang, watching his face for a flinch.

“Civey of Swannes,” he corrected, then immediately wished he hadn’t. “A stew of swan. Spiced with ginger, cloves, galangal. Thickened with bread and blood.”

A flicker in her eyes, a slight tightening at the corner of her mouth. Even she, who had doubtless seen the mundane grotesqueries of the city, found it arcane. Disturbingly so. “Two very specific, very unusual meals. Prepared by you. And now both clients are dead.” She let the sentence sit in the space between them, as palpable as the smell of the old books.

Leo felt the old, familiar defensiveness rise, a sour heat in his throat. It was the same feeling he’d get when a restaurant owner would storm out of the kitchen after a savage review, sputtering excuses. But this wasn’t about over-salted soup. This was about the stillness of a body in a silk-lined room, the finality of a coroner’s report. He crossed his arms, his hands tucking into his armpits, suddenly aware of the flour under his nails, the tiny burn scar on his thumb.

“They were unusual requests,” he said, forcing his voice level. “That’s my business. I reconstruct historical cuisine. I don’t ask why. I just… execute.” The word felt terrible as soon as it left his mouth.

Detective Chen’s gaze drifted past him, over his shoulder, to the landscape of books. Her eyes moved along the shelves, not reading titles, but assessing the sheer mass of it, the obsession it represented. “You have quite the library. It looks less like a collection and more like an arsenal.”

“It’s research,” he said, too quickly.

“For recipes that kill people?” she asked, her tone still flat, but the question was a needle.

“The food wasn’t poisoned.” The statement sounded weak, even to him. “The police, the medical examiner… they would have found something. With Thorne. They did check, didn’t they?”

“They did. And found nothing conclusive. Which is why I’m here, and not a forensics team tearing your kitchen apart.” She took a single step further into the room, her shoes making no sound on the rug. “But ‘nothing conclusive’ isn’t ‘nothing.’ It’s an absence of evidence. Sometimes, Mr. Vance, the absence is the evidence. It tells you you’re looking for the wrong thing.” Her eyes finally snapped back to his. “Tell me about the process. For the swan. For the porpoise. Not the recipe. The process. Where you shopped. Who handled the ingredients. How you transported them.”

Leo’s mind raced, tripping over details. The swan had come from a licensed game farm upstate, the permit paperwork a nightmare. The mahi-mahi from the Fulton Fish Market at 4 a.m., the air thick with ice and brine, the fishmonger’s hands chapped and red. He’d driven the meals himself, in insulated bags, straight from his kitchen to their doors. No intermediaries. Every herb measured by his own hand. Every sauce reduced by his own watch.

“It was just me,” he said, the truth feeling like a trap. “From start to finish. I have receipts. Contacts.”

“I’ll need all of them.” She finally moved, walking slowly toward his worktable. She didn’t touch the facsimile, but she leaned over it, her shadow falling across the illuminated page of a boar’s head on a platter. “This is what you were looking at when I knocked. What were you looking for?”

He couldn’t lie. The book was open to the very page. “Confirmation,” he admitted, the word tasting of ash.

“Of what?”

“That the two dishes are connected. Not just by me. By… by history. By intention. They’re both from the same era. They’re both dishes of extreme privilege, of showing off. They’re violent.”

Detective Chen straightened up and looked at him, a long, appraising look. For the first time, her expression shifted from detached assessment to something more complex—a sharp, professional curiosity. “You think someone is using your food… your knowledge… as a weapon. And framing you for it.”

Hearing it stated so plainly made the room tilt. The dust motes dancing in the window light seemed to freeze. “I don’t know what I think,” he whispered. “But two is a pattern. And I’m the only thread between them.”

She nodded slowly, as if he’d passed a small, initial test. “Then you have a problem, Mr. Vance. And so do I. Because if you’re not the killer, then the killer knows your work intimately. They know your clients. They know your schedule. They might even,” she said, her gaze sweeping the room once more, “have a taste for history.” She pulled a card from her coat pocket and placed it on the edge of the oak table, next to the gilded nightmare of the manuscript. The plain white rectangle looked alien against the ancient colors.

“I will be in touch. Do not leave the city. And do not,” she said, pausing at the door, her hand on the knob, “accept any new requests for historical meals. Not until we understand the recipe we’re dealing with here.”

After she left, the silence rushed back in, but it was different now. It was no longer just the silence of panic, but the silence of a hunted thing holding its breath. He looked at the detective’s card, then at the open book, the grinning jester in the margin. The jester seemed to be laughing at a joke only he could hear—a joke written in old Latin, served on fine china, and ending in the profound, inarguable silence of the grave. The ghost of sage and pepper seemed to fill his nostrils again, but now it smelled like a warning.
