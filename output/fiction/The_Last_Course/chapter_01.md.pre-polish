 Mara’s fingers tightened around the knife, the cold steel biting into her palm. She had heard enough. She stepped into the doorway, her presence cutting through the silence like a blade.

“Finch,” she said, her voice steady, though her pulse hammered in her throat. “What are you talking about?”

Finch turned to her, his smile widening, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Ah, Mara. Just in time. I was about to explain to Leo that the swan is… *special*. A gift, you might say.”

Mara’s stomach twisted. “A gift? From who?”

Finch’s gaze flicked back to Leo, his expression unreadable. “From a mutual acquaintance. Someone who understands the value of… *loyalty*.”

Leo’s breath hitched. *Loyalty?* The word felt like a noose tightening around his neck. He had been careful, so careful, but Finch had always had a way of seeing things, of knowing things.

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “And what does this have to do with Leo?”

Finch leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled. “Everything, my dear. Everything.”

The air seemed to vibrate with tension. And Mara, in the doorway, felt the weight of the moment pressing down on her. She knew Finch was playing a game, but she didn’t know the rules. And she didn’t know who the other players were.

But she knew one thing: Finch was dangerous. And Leo was in his sights.

She took a step forward, her voice low. “Finch, what are you planning?”

Finch’s smile widened, but it was cold, calculated. “I’m planning nothing, Mara. I’m merely… *suggesting* that Leo might consider his position here. And his… *future*.”

Leo’s heart pounded in his chest. He had been here before, trapped in Finch’s web, but this time, it felt different. This time, the stakes were higher.

Mara’s eyes flicked to the swan, then back to Finch. “And what about the swan?”

Finch’s gaze followed hers, his expression unreadable. “Ah, yes. The swan. A delicate creature, isn’t it? So… *fragile*.”

The air seemed to vibrate with tension. And Mara, in the doorway, felt the weight of the moment pressing down on her. She knew Finch was playing a game, but she didn’t know the rules. And she didn’t know who the other players were.

But she knew one thing: Finch was dangerous. And Leo was in his right sights.

She took a step forward, her voice low. “Finch, what are you planning?”

Finch’s smile widened, but it was cold, calculated. “I’m planning nothing, Mara. I’m merely… *suggesting* that Leo might consider his position here. And his… *future*.”

Leo’s heart pounded in his chest. He had been here before, trapped in Finch’s web, but this time, it felt different. This time, the stakes were higher.

Mara’s eyes flicked to the swan, then back to Finch. “And what about the swan?”

Finch’s gaze followed hers, the corner of his mouth twitching. “Ah, yes. The swan. A delicate creature, isn’t it? So… *fragile*.”

The air seemed to vibrate with tension. And Mara, in the doorway, felt the weight of the moment pressing down on her. She knew Finch was playing a game, but she didn’t know the rules. And she didn’t know who the other players were.

But she knew one thing: Finch was dangerous. And Leo was in his right sights.

She took a step forward, her voice low. “Finch, what are you planning?”

Finch’s smile widened, but it was cold, calculated. “I’m planning nothing, Mara. I’m merely… *suggesting* that Leo might consider his position here. And his… *future*.”

Leo’s heart pounded in the silence. The air was thick with the scent of the swan’s blood, metallic and sharp, mingling with the earthy aroma of A high-end, professional kitchen (the primary stage) herbs. The weight of Finch’s words pressed down on him, a physical force. He could feel the cold sweat beading on his forehead, the way his fingers trembled ever so slightly.

*Think. Think. Think.*

But his mind was a whirlwind, thoughts colliding and scattering like leaves in a storm. The swan. The gift. The loyalty. The future.

Finch’s voice cut through the chaos, smooth as silk, sharp as a blade.

“Leo, my dear boy, you’ve been with us for what, five years now? And in that time, you’ve proven yourself invaluable. A true asset to A household of unspoken hierarchies and tensions.”

Leo swallowed hard, his throat dry. “Thank you, sir. I’ve done my best.”

Finch’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Oh, I know you have. And that’s why this conversation is so… *necessary*.”

Mara’s grip on the knife tightened, her knuckles turning white. She could see the tension in Leo’s shoulders, the way his fingers curled into fists at his sides. She knew that look. It was the look of a man cornered.

“Finch,” she said, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. “What exactly are you suggesting?”

Finch’s gaze flicked to her, his expression unreadable. “I’m suggesting, my dear Mara, that Leo’s position here is… *precarious*. That his future is not as secure as he might believe.”

Leo’s breath hitched. “Precarious? Sir, I don’t understand. I’ve always been loyal. I’ve always done what was asked of me.”

Finch’s smile widened, but it was a predator’s smile. “Oh, Leo. Loyalty is such a… *flexible* concept, isn’t it? And I’ve heard whispers. Whispers of… *dissatisfaction*.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “Whispers? From who?”

Finch’s gaze flicked to A high-end, professional kitchen (the primary stage) door, then back to her. “From those who know. Those who see.”

The air seemed to vibrate with tension. And Mara, in the doorway, felt the weight of the moment pressing down on her. She knew Finch was playing a game, but she didn’t know the rules. And she didn’t know who the other players were.

But she knew one thing: Finch was dangerous. And Leo was in his right sights.
