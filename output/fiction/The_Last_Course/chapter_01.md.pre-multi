Chapter 1: The Bitter Aftertaste

The air in Arthur Finch’s kitchen was a cathedral of precision, and Leo Vance was its solitary, fallen priest. It was so quiet he could hear the faint, high-frequency whine of the LED strips hidden beneath the cabinets, a sound like distant tinnitus, and the low, almost sub-auditory thrum of the building’s ventilation, a constant exhalation. The room was a study in sterile opulence: polished volcanic stone counters cold enough to make his fingertips ache, induction hobs that hummed like sleeping dragons, a climate-controlled wall of knives that gleamed like surgical instruments behind its glass pane, each slot a numbered grave. The refrigeration units sighed open with a pneumatic hiss, releasing a puff of air that smelled of nothing, absolutely nothing—not even the ghost of a former ingredient. It was a temple to the future, and here Leo was, committing an act of culinary archaeology, his own breath sounding coarse and animal in the purified silence.

Before him, the swan.

It wasn’t a whole bird, of course—that would have been grotesque, impractical. Finch’s people, a silent, efficient procurement team in identical navy wool coats, had delivered it in a matte black case lined with grey gel packs that felt like cold, dead flesh to the touch. The breasts, two long, pale fillets the colour of old ivory, were marbled with a faint, delicate tracery of fat like cracks in antique porcelain. They lay on a slab of black slate, cold and slightly damp, looking less like meat and more like something sculpted for a tomb. A single, downy feather, impossibly soft and grey, had been caught in the seam of the case. Leo had stared at it for a full minute before carefully brushing it into the bio-waste chute, feeling a pang that was neither guilt nor reverence, but a hollow recognition of a life reduced to a clinical specification. He assumed the rest of the bird had been disposed of with the same discreet efficiency Finch’s companies used to delete data—shredded, incinerated, dissolved. The thought made the muscles between his shoulder blades tighten into a familiar knot of complicity.

Leo’s hands, broad and scarred from a thousand burns and nicks—a pale, shiny crescent from a dropped clarified butter pot, a cross-hatch of silvery lines from hurried herb chopping—moved with a tense economy. He had no room for flourish here, not anymore. The scandal in The Epicurean Review three months prior—the plagiarism, the exposed “borrowed” poetry of taste from a dead critic’s unpublished notes—had cut that part out of him. The man who once wrote of foie gras as “the melancholy, buttery sigh of a contented goose” was gone. In his place stood a technician, a ghost-cook who prepared meals for those who valued exclusivity over understanding. He could still feel the phantom weight of his old chef’s knife, the one he’d sold to cover rent, its handle worn smooth by his grip. The one he used now, provided by Finch, was a Japanese yanagiba of flawless blue steel, perfectly balanced and cold in his hand. It felt like a stranger, an accomplice.

He turned to his galentyne. The sauce was the soul of the dish, a forgotten medieval concoction meant to mask, to transform, to shout down the taste of aging meat with spice and sour. In his small apartment kitchen last night, with the persistent, arrhythmic drip of a faulty tap marking time, he’d ground the long pepper and grains of paradise in a granite mortar. The sound had been a rough, grinding percussion. Their aromas—hot, piney, ancient, with a hint of something floral that died instantly—had filled the cramped space, clinging to the curtains and for a moment, drowning out the smell of damp mail and stale regret. Here in Finch’s kitchen, under light so white it left no shadow and turned every surface into a flat plane, he combined the spices with fine, golden breadcrumbs that felt like sand between his fingers, aged sherry vinegar that hit the back of his sinuses with a sharp, woody punch, and a stick of true Ceylon cinnamon, its bark papery and fragile. He worked over a low heat, the sauce thickening with a slow, reluctant bubble, the surface breaking with tiny, languid pops. The scent that rose was profoundly alien to this room: a sweet, sharp, musty perfume that spoke of smoky halls, rushes on the floor, and coarse laughter, not silent algorithms and HEPA-filtered air. It was the smell of history, and in this context, it smelled like decay, like something dug up.

He seared the swan breasts in clarified butter he’d made earlier, watching the liquid gold pool and shimmer. The sound was a whisper, not a sizzle, the pale flesh resisting colour, only just taking on the faintest blush of gold at the edges, like a blush of shame. The fat rendered slowly, beading on the surface like sweat on skin. The meat itself was dense, with a tight, almost muscular grain unlike any poultry he knew. When he pressed it with the pad of his thumb, it yielded with a firm, almost rubbery resistance, springing back slowly. He let it rest on a wire rack, watching the juices—a pale, pinkish fluid—gather and be slowly reabsorbed, a process that felt like watching a wound close in fast, silent motion.

He plated them on a dish of plain white porcelain, so thin it was nearly translucent at the rim and hummed with a faint, crystalline resonance when he set it down—Finch had specified no garnishes, no “distractions”—and spooned the ruddy-brown galentyne in a careful, stark arc beside them. The sauce was thick, speckled with dark spices, pooling like a forgotten moat around a castle wall. It looked severe, monastic. A dish of punishment, Leo thought, not pleasure. A meal for a man who consumed reputations as easily as he consumed rare ingredients, who would taste the history and the obscurity and feel nothing but the satisfaction of possession.

A woman in a grey linen suit appeared at the kitchen entrance. She was Finch’s assistant, Mara. Her eyes scanned the room, not meeting his, checking the state of the counters, the absence of mess, the precise alignment of tools. Her perfume was something clean and metallic, like chilled ozone or the static after a printer finishes a run.

“He’s ready.” Her voice was as neutral as the room’s temperature, devoid of inflection. It wasn’t dismissive; it was simply empty, a vocalisation of the ambient silence.

Leo followed her, the plate balanced on his palm, the warmth of the meat bleeding through the fine china into his skin, a localized heat against the chill of the air-conditioning. They moved through a living space that felt less like a home and more like a museum of minimalism during closed hours. The floor was pale, wide-plank oak, each footfall absorbed into a profound quiet. A single, vast painting dominated one wall—a canvas of layered grey washes, devoid of form, that seemed to swallow the light. The furniture was low, angular, upholstered in shades of charcoal and bone. There were no books, no screens, no personal artifacts. The only sound was the whisper of his own chef’s jacket, cotton so crisp it scraped against his neck with every step like a mild abrasive, and the faint, metronomic click of Mara’s heels on the wood, a sound that seemed to measure out the distance to his judgement.

They stopped before a door of frosted glass, its surface clouded like ice. Mara placed her hand flat on a brushed steel panel; it clicked open with a sound so soft it was more a vibration in the air than a noise.

The room beyond was an office, but it felt like a cockpit or a sanctum. One entire wall was a seamless window overlooking the city, the skyline glittering with indifferent lights, tiny electric cells in a vast, dark organism. The other walls were lined with screens, currently dark and dustless, reflecting the cityscape in dim, ghostly fragments. In the centre of the room, behind a desk that was a single sheet of slate on steel legs, sat Arthur Finch.

Finch did not look up immediately. He was studying something on a tablet, the device’s glow casting his face in a pale, blueish light that hollowed his cheeks and deepened the sockets of his eyes. He was a man of sharp angles and contained motion. His hair, steel-grey, was cut with a severity that matched the room. After a moment that stretched long enough for Leo to feel the weight of the plate in his hand grow precarious, Finch set the tablet down without a sound and looked up.

His eyes were the colour of the slate desk. They moved from Leo’s face to the plate, assessing, cataloguing. There was no curiosity in them, only a kind of operational scrutiny.

“The Swan Upping,” Finch said. His voice was dry, precise, each word placed with care. It wasn’t loud, but it filled the silent room completely. “An obscure name for an obscure practice. The marking of swans on the Thames. Ownership.” He gestured with two fingers, a minimal flick towards the empty space on the desk before him. “Set it there.”

Leo stepped forward, the soft sole of his kitchen shoe whispering on the polished concrete floor. He placed the plate on the exact spot indicated. As he straightened, he caught a scent in the room beneath the filtered air: a faint, clean aroma of bergamot and starched cotton, overlaid with something else, something dry and intellectual, like old paper and ink.

Finch picked up the cutlery that lay waiting—a knife and fork with handles of some dark, matte wood, their forms brutally simple. He did not look at Leo as he spoke. “Mara tells me you prepared the galentyne authentically. Mortar and pestle. Not a spice grinder.”

“The texture is different,” Leo said, his own voice sounding rough-edged in comparison. “A grinder heats the spices. It changes the flavour profile.” He heard the ghost of his old, lecturing tone and winced inwardly.

“A change modern technology usually celebrates,” Finch remarked. He cut into the swan breast. The flesh parted with a slight resistance, revealing an interior that was a uniform, pale grey-pink, without a hint of rosiness. He examined the morsel on his fork, turning it slightly to catch the light. “Efficiency over character. But here, you chose character. Or rather, historical fetishism.” He placed the meat in his mouth and chewed, his jaw moving with slow, deliberate cycles. His expression did not change.

Leo watched him, feeling his own pulse in his throat. He could imagine the taste: the dense, gamey richness of the swan, a flavour like duck amplified and made strange, followed by the aggressive, sweet-sour punch of the galentyne, the peppery heat blooming late on the tongue. It was a confrontational dish.

Finch swallowed and took a sip of water from a crystal tumbler. “It tastes of contradiction,” he said finally. “The meat is pure, rare protein. Isolated. The sauce is a cacophony. A medieval attempt to shout over the reality of what was, most likely, a tough old bird.” He set his fork down, the tines making a tiny, clear tink against the porcelain. “You served me a metaphor, Mr. Vance. The rare and precious, drowned out by noise. The signal and the static.” His slate eyes lifted and fixed on Leo. “Was that your intention? To comment on the nature of my request? Or on the nature of your own situation?”

The question hung in the air, sharp as the knife on the plate. Leo felt a cold sweat start between his shoulder blades. He had thought only of the recipe, of the technical execution. Any deeper intention had been buried under the simple need to do the job, to get paid, to stay in the game that had exiled him. Finch was reading ashes where there had only been fire.

“It’s just a historical recipe,” Leo said, the words feeling inadequate. “The galentyne was period-appropriate for swan.”

“Period-appropriate,” Finch repeated, as if tasting the phrase. He leaned back in his chair, which made no sound. “You are a man recently stripped of your own narrative, Mr. Vance. Your words were found to be… borrowed. And now you serve me a dish whose very purpose was to disguise. To overlay a more palatable story over a less palatable truth.” A thin, almost non-existent smile touched his lips. “I find the symmetry quite remarkable.”

He picked up his fork again and took another bite, chewing thoughtfully. “The technique is flawless. The swan is perfectly cooked. The sauce is balanced, if aggressively so.” He paused. “It is competent. It is even interesting. But it lacks a point of view. It is either a coward’s dish, hiding behind history, or a provocateur’s dish, which I don’t believe you have the stomach for anymore. So which is it?”

The silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the distant, muted hum of the city through the glass. Leo’s mind was blank, scoured clean by the clinical brutality of the analysis. He had cooked a thing, and this man had dissected not the food, but him.

“I cooked what you asked for,” Leo managed, hearing the defensive flatness in his own voice.

“Indeed you did,” Finch said. He pushed the plate away, the meal only a quarter eaten. The swan breast lay exposed, the galentyne moat breached. “Precisely, and without soul. That, it seems, is what you have to offer now. A certain type of client will value that. Mara will see to your payment.”

The dismissal was total. Finch’s attention had already returned to his tablet, the glow once again painting his face in cold, featureless light. He was already elsewhere.

Leo stood for a second longer, the image of the unfinished plate searing itself into his mind: the elegant, brutalist porcelain, the rare meat, the archaic sauce, all rejected not for taste, but for meaning. He turned and walked back towards the kitchen, the pristine, silent gallery now feeling like a tunnel. The high whine of the LEDs was back in his ears, that constant, piercing note. He understood now. He wasn’t a fallen priest in this cathedral. He was just part of the ventilation system, moving air from one sterile chamber to another, a function without a form. The bitter aftertaste wasn’t from the galentyne; it was from the understanding, clean and metallic as Mara’s perfume, of what he had become.
