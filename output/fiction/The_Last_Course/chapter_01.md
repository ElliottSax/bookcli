Mara’s fingers tightened around the knife, the cold steel biting into her palm. Enough. She stepped into the doorway, her presence cutting through the silence like a blade.

“Finch,” she said, her voice steady, though her pulse hammered in her throat. “What are you talking about?”

Finch turned to her, his smile widening, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Ah, Mara. Just in time. I was about to explain to Leo that the swan is… *special*. A gift, you might say.”

A knot twisted in Mara’s stomach. “A gift? From who?”

Finch’s gaze flicked back to Leo, his expression unreadable. “From a mutual acquaintance. Someone who understands the value of… *loyalty*.”

Leo’s breath hitched. *Loyalty?* The word tightened around his neck like a noose. He had been careful, so careful, but Finch had always seen through everything.

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “And what does this have to do with Leo?”

Leaning back in his chair, Finch steepled his fingers. “Everything, my dear. Everything.”

Tension vibrated in the air, pressing down on Mara in the doorway. Finch was playing a game, but the rules remained a mystery, the other players unknown.

One thing was certain: Finch was dangerous. And Leo was in his sights.

She took a step forward, her voice low. “Finch, what are you planning?”

His smile widened, cold and calculated. “I’m planning nothing, Mara. I’m merely… *suggesting* that Leo might consider his position here. And his… *future*.”

A frantic drumbeat thrummed against Leo’s ribs. He had been here before, trapped in Finch’s web, but this time felt different. This time, the stakes were higher.

Mara’s eyes flicked to the swan, then back to Finch. “And what about the swan?”

Finch’s gaze followed hers, the corner of his mouth twitching. “Ah, yes. The swan. A delicate creature, isn’t it? So… *fragile*.”

The air thickened. Mara knew Finch was playing a game, but she didn’t know the rules or the other players.

But she knew one thing: Finch was dangerous. And Leo was squarely in his sights.

She took a step forward, her voice low. “Finch, what are you planning?”

Finch’s smile widened, but it was cold, calculated. “I’m planning nothing, Mara. I’m merely… *suggesting* that Leo might consider his position here. And his… *future*.”

Leo’s heart hammered against the silence. The air grew thick with the scent of the swan’s blood, metallic and sharp, mingling with the earthy aroma of herbs. Finch’s words pressed down on him, a physical force. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead; his fingers trembled ever so slightly.

*Think. Think. Think.*

But his mind was a whirlwind, thoughts colliding and scattering like leaves in a storm. The swan. The gift. The loyalty. The future.

Finch’s voice cut through the chaos, smooth as silk, sharp as a blade.

“Leo, my dear boy, you’ve been with us for what, five years now? And in that time, you’ve proven yourself invaluable. A true asset.”

Leo swallowed hard, his throat dry. “Thank you, sir. I’ve done my best.”

Finch’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Oh, I know you have. And that’s why this conversation is so… *necessary*.”

Mara’s grip on the knife tightened, her knuckles turning white. Tension corded the muscles in Leo’s shoulders; his fingers curled into fists at his sides. That was the look of a cornered man.

“Finch,” she said, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. “What exactly are you suggesting?”

Finch’s gaze flicked to her, his expression unreadable. “I’m suggesting, my dear Mara, that Leo’s position here is… *precarious*. That his future is not as secure as he might believe.”

Leo’s breath hitched. “Precarious? Sir, I don’t understand. I’ve always been loyal. I’ve always done what was asked of me.”

Finch’s smile widened into a predator’s grin. “Oh, Leo. Loyalty is such a… *flexible* concept, isn’t it? And I’ve heard whispers. Whispers of… *dissatisfaction*.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “Whispers? From who?”

Finch’s gaze flicked to the door, then back to her. “From those who know. Those who see.”

The air crackled. The weight of the moment pressed down on Mara in the doorway. Finch was playing a game, but the rules and players remained shrouded.

But she knew one thing: Finch was dangerous. And Leo was squarely in his sights.

She took a step forward, her voice low. “Finch, what are you planning?”

Finch’s smile widened, but it was cold, calculated. “I’m planning nothing, Mara. I’m merely… *suggesting* that Leo might consider his position here. And his… *future*.”

Leo’s heart pounded against the silence. The air thickened with the scent of the swan’s blood, metallic and sharp, mingling with the earthy aroma of herbs. The weight of Finch’s words pressed down on him, a physical force. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead; his fingers trembled ever so slightly.

Finch’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Oh, I know you have. And that’s why this conversation is so… *necessary*.”

Mara’s grip on the knife tightened, her knuckles turning white. She could see the tension in Leo’s shoulders, the way his fingers curled into fists at his sides. She knew that look. It was the look of a man cornered.

“Finch,” she said, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. “What exactly are you suggesting?”

Finch’s gaze flicked to her, his expression unreadable. “I’m suggesting, my dear Mara, that Leo’s position here is… *precarious*. That his future is not as secure as he might believe.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “Whispers? From who?”

Finch’s gaze flicked to A high-end, professional kitchen (the primary stage) door, then back to her. “From those who know. Those who see.”

The air seemed to vibrate with tension. And Mara, in the doorway, felt the weight of the moment pressing down on her. She knew Finch was playing a game, but she didn’t know the rules. And she didn’t know who the other players were.

But she knew one thing: Finch was dangerous. And Leo was in his right sights.

Leo swallowed hard, his throat dry. “Thank you, sir. I’ve done my best.”
