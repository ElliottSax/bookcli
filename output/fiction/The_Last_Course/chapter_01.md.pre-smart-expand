# Chapter 1: The Bitter Aftertaste

The air in Arthur Finch’s kitchen was a cathedral of precision, and Leo Vance was its solitary, fallen priest. The room was a study in sterile opulence: polished volcanic stone counters, induction hobs that hummed like sleeping dragons, a climate-controlled wall of knives that gleamed like surgical instruments. It was a temple to the future, and here Leo was, committing an act of culinary archaeology.

Before him, the swan.

It wasn’t a whole bird, of course—that would have been grotesque, impractical. Finch’s people, a silent, efficient procurement team, had supplied the breasts, two long, pale fillets the colour of old ivory, marbled with a faint, delicate tracery of fat. They lay on a slab of black slate, looking less like meat and more like something sculpted for a tomb. Leo assumed the rest of the bird had been disposed of with the same discreet efficiency Finch’s companies used to delete data.

Leo’s hands, broad and scarred from a thousand burns and nicks, moved with a tense economy. He had no room for flourish here, not anymore. The scandal in *The Epicurean Review*—the plagiarism, the exposed “borrowed” poetry of taste from a dead critic’s unpublished notes—had cut that part out of him. The man who once wrote of foie gras as “the melancholy, buttery sigh of a contented goose” was gone. In his place stood a technician, a ghost-cook who prepared meals for those who valued exclusivity over understanding.

He turned to his *galentyne*. The sauce was the soul of the dish, a forgotten medieval concoction meant to mask, to transform. In his small apartment kitchen last night, he’d ground the long pepper and grains of paradise, their aromas—hot, piney, ancient—filling the cramped space and for a moment, drowning out the smell of failure. Here in Finch’s kitchen, he combined the spices with breadcrumbs, vinegar, and cinnamon over a low heat. The scent that rose was profoundly alien to this room: a sweet, sharp, musty perfume that spoke of smoky halls and coarse laughter, not silent algorithms and filtered air.

He seared the swan breasts. The sound was a whisper, not a sizzle, the pale flesh resisting colour, only just taking on the faintest blush of gold. He plated them on a dish of plain white porcelain—Finch had specified no garnishes, no “distractions”—and spooned the ruddy-brown *galentyne* in a careful arc beside them. The sauce was thick, speckled with dark spices, pooling like a forgotten moat around a castle wall. It looked severe, monastic. A dish of punishment, Leo thought, not pleasure.

A woman in a grey linen suit appeared at the kitchen entrance. She was Finch’s assistant, Mara. Her eyes scanned the room, not meeting his.

“He’s ready.”

Leo followed her, the plate balanced on his palm, through a living space that felt less like a home and more like a museum of minimalism. The only sound was the whisper of his own chef’s jacket, cotton so crisp it felt like cardboard. They stopped before a
