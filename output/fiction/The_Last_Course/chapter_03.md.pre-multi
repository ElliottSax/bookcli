# Chapter 3: The Ghost of Kitchens Past

The rain on the taxi window blurred London into a smear of grey watercolour and sodium light. Leo Vance watched it, but saw only the precise, terrible geometry of a death plate: the glistening, saffron-stained *blankmanger* he’d served to Alistair Finch, the deep burgundy of the *sawse madame* that had accompanied the lamb for the second victim, a reclusive heiress named Celia Fortescue. Two clients. Two obscure dishes from his personal collection of culinary arcana. Two deaths, neat and quiet as a folded napkin, within forty-eight hours of his leaving their homes.

The police had been polite, persistent, and utterly convinced of his guilt. The scandal from three years ago—the accusation that he’d plagiarized his seminal review of *Le Cénacle*, the subsequent collapse of his career—hung around his neck like a millstone of rancid butter. It made him a perfect suspect: a fallen man with a grudge against the elite, whose very profession granted him intimate, unsupervised access.

He needed an archivist, not a detective. He needed someone who could trace the ghost in his own kitchen. There was only one person left who might, and the thought of facing her tightened his stomach more than the murder accusations.

The taxi stopped in Bloomsbury, before a Georgian terrace the colour of old teeth. A brass plaque beside a black door read: *Dr. Elara Vance, Institute of Medieval Studies*. His sister’s name was a small, cold shock. He paid the driver and stood in the drizzle, the scent of wet pavement and distant diesel filling his lungs. The last time he’d seen her was at their mother’s funeral, two years ago. Her silence had been more final than the coffin’s lid.

He rang the bell. The intercom crackled, but no voice emerged. After a minute, the lock buzzed like an angry wasp.

The hallway was a tunnel of shadows and polished oak, smelling of beeswax and slow decay. At the end, a door stood ajar, spilling out a pool of warm, book-lined light. He pushed it open.

Elara’s workspace was a beautiful chaos. High ceilings were lost in gloom, but every wall was sheathed in books, their leather spines cracked and gilded. A massive oak desk, scarred by centuries of study, was an island under a green-shaded lamp. She stood behind it, not looking up from a vellum manuscript held flat by velvet-covered weights. She was smaller than he remembered, a bird-like figure in a charcoal turtleneck, her dark hair shot through with strands of silver he hadn’t seen before. The light caught the lenses of her glasses, turning them into blank, luminous discs.

“You have five minutes,” she said, her voice dry as parchment. “I have a lecture on the socio-economic implications of the barley tax in 14th-century Norfolk.”

“Charming,” Leo said, his own voice rough from lack of sleep. He shrugged off his damp coat, the wet wool smell joining the room’s bouquet of dust, paper, and a faint, sweet note of decay from the ancient texts.

“I’m being framed for murder, Elara.”

Her hand, holding a magnifying glass, paused for a fraction of a second. Then she carefully set the glass down and finally looked at him. Her eyes, the same hazel as his but sharper, devoid of his own habitual weariness, scanned his face. She saw the tremor in his hands, the shadow of stubble, the panic he was trying to cage behind his ribs.

“I read about Finch,” she said. “And Fortescue this morning. The papers are calling you ‘The Poisoner Palate.’ Catchy.”

“I didn’t do it.”

“I didn’t say you did.” She removed her glasses, pinching the bridge of her nose. “You’ve always had appalling taste in friends and clients, but homicide requires a follow-through you’ve never possessed. You’re more of a… flincher. What do you need?”

The blunt assessment was almost a relief. He pulled a folded sheet of paper from his inner pocket, the linen stationery crisp. On it, he’d transcribed the two recipes in his precise, chef’s hand.

“These. I need to know where they’re from. Not just ‘medieval.’ Specifically.”

She took the paper, her fingers brushing his. They were ice-cold. She moved under the lamp, the light now carving the fine, tired lines around her mouth. She read, her lips moving silently. He watched her, the familiar furrow appearing between her brows. The room was utterly silent, a vacuum sealed against the city’s hum. He could hear the faint, dry whisper of the parchment on her desk, the creak of the old house settling. The claustrophobia of the book-lined walls pressed in, a physical weight.

“*Blankmanger* with saffron and *viande* of capon,” she murmured. “*Sawse madame* for roasted lamb. Not common. These are… specific. Opulent. For a very wealthy table.” She looked up. “You sourced these from your collection?”

“The Finch one was from a folio I bought at an auction in Marseille. A fragment. The Fortescue dish was from a digital scan of a manuscript listed as ‘Anonymous, English, circa 1390.’ I cross-referenced ingredients with other sources to fill gaps.”

“A culinary jigsaw puzzle.” She turned to a towering shelf, her fingers walking the spines with unconscious intimacy. She pulled down a heavy, modern tome, its pages thick as slices of ham. She flicked through, then shook her head. Another book, this one older, its pages brown at the edges. The search continued, a silent ballet of scholarship. Leo stood, feeling useless, the scent of old knowledge—musty, profound, slightly fungal—filling his nostrils. He watched dust motes dance in the lamp’s beam like tiny, doomed stars.

Finally, she pulled a slim, unbound portfolio from a bottom drawer. It contained high-resolution photographs of manuscript pages. She laid them out beside his notes, her movements quickening.

“Here,” she said, her voice dropping to a whisper, as if the words themselves were dangerous. She pointed a pale finger at a photograph. The script was a dense, Gothic blackletter, crawling across the page like insects. Beside it was an illumination: a grotesque, jolly-faced man seated at a table, his belly distended, his mouth open in a laugh or a scream. The food on the table was rendered in obscenely vivid detail—a peacock, its tail fanned, a glistening boar’s head, pies that seemed to swell from the page.

“*The Sated Man’s Grimoire*,” Elara said. “Mid-15th century, provenance murky. Attributed to a scribe known only as ‘M.’ It’s not a cookbook for a household. It’s a treatise on excess. A liturgical text for gluttony as a form of power. Each recipe is a performance, a calculated display of wealth so extreme it borders on the blasphemous.”

Leo leaned in, his heart thudding against his sternum. There, in the dense text, he could pick out words: *saffran*, *capoun*, *saulce madame*.

“This is it,” he breathed. “This is the source.”

“It’s also,” Elara continued, her tone grimly academic, “a text rumored to have been adopted by a shadowy consortium—a guild, of sorts—calling themselves the *Convivium Sacer*. The Sacred Feast. They were poisoners, Leo. The most elite poisoners in history. They didn’t just kill; they staged deaths as art. A death was a final, exquisite course. The poison was always in the dish that most perfectly represented the victim’s sin. Gluttony, pride, wrath… they called it ‘the last course.’”

The air left Leo’s lungs. The claustrophobic room seemed to spin, the bookshelves tilting inwards. He wasn’t just cooking obscure food. He was unwittingly providing the scripture for a murderous liturgy.

“Why me?” he whispered, the sound swallowed by the room.

“You’re the only one left who cooks from these sources with any authenticity,” she said, not unkindly. “You’re a purist. A disgraced purist, which makes you the perfect puppet. No one would believe your protests. You’re not the killer, Leo. You’re the signature.”

The horror of it was sumptuous, ornate. He was the garnish on a plate of murder.

He stumbled back to a worn leather armchair, its springs groaning. He needed to think like them. To see the pattern.

“My last six clients,” he said, more to himself than to her. He pulled out his phone, opening his booking ledger. “Finch. Tech. Ruthless. Destroyed competitors, hoarded data. A modern-day dragon sitting on a gold of information.”

“Gluttony for power,” Elara nodded, leaning against her desk, the scholar engaged.

“Celia Fortescue. Old money. Art collector. She was infamous for buying masterpieces and locking them away in private vaults, never to be seen. She consumed beauty solely for herself.”

“Gluttony for possession. For beauty.”

He scrolled. “Marcus Hoyt. The private equity vulture. Strip-mined companies, left communities barren.”

“Gluttony for wealth.”

“Lady Eleanor Chase. Fashion empire. Allegations of sweatshops, crushing debt for suppliers. A vanity that fed on exploitation.”

“Gluttony for admiration.”

“Senator Richard Croft. Hard-right, anti-immigration. Built a career on fear, on consuming the public’s security for his own gain.”

“Gluttony for control.”

He reached the last name. His blood went cold. “Elias Thorn. Shipping magnate. His company’s been fined for ecological disasters, slave labor allegations in his shipyards. He consumes… everything. Resources, people, the sea itself.”

“Gluttony without limit,” Elara finished. “The Sated Man himself.”

A pattern, clear and chilling as a knife on marble. “The timing. Finch died roughly 48 hours after I served him. Fortescue, the same. They’re following a schedule. A ritual.”

He looked at the date of his booking for Elias Thorn. It was for tomorrow night. A bespoke, twelve-course medieval feast. The menu was planned, the ingredients ordered.

“Thorn is next,” Leo said, standing up so quickly the chair screeched. “The killer will strike there. I have to stop it. I have to warn him.”

“Leo,” Elara’s voice held a warning. “If this is the *Convivium Sacer*, or someone copying them, they are inside his world. They will know you’re coming. This is their theater. You’re walking onto the stage.”

“I have to try. It’s my menu. My food.” The guilt was a taste in his mouth, metallic and sour.

She studied him for a long moment, then sighed. She walked to a small, locked cabinet, retrieved a key from a chain around her neck, and opened it. From inside, she took a single sheet of modern paper, a photocopy of a manuscript page. She handed it to him.

“The *Grimoire* has a final section,” she said. “Recipes so extreme they were considered mythical. ‘The Last Course’ for each sin. This is the one for limitless gluttony. *Cocatrice à l’Hydre*. A mythical beast, pieced together from multiple animals, roasted with rare spices and… well, you’ll see. If they are following the text to the letter, this will be the finale. The killing dish.”

Leo took the page. The description was fantastical, monstrous. It felt heavy in his hand.

“Thank you, Elara.”

She didn’t smile. “Don’t thank me. Just don’t get yourself killed.” Her voice lowered. “I’ve already lost one family to silence. I don’t want to lose another.”

He gave a stiff nod and fled the close, scholarly air for the damp chill of the street.

The city’s grime clung to him like a second skin. Her accusation echoed in the rumble of the Underground and the hiss of passing tyres all the way back to his flat. *A killer’s practice.* The thought was a seed of dread, now planted.

It grew roots that night. He stared at the ceiling, sleepless, his mind tracing the terrible logic from a scholar’s theory to a murderer’s method. By morning, the need for answers had solidified.

He booked the hire car before dawn.

As London’s sprawl yielded to the winding lanes of Surrey, her words were no longer a whisper. They were a driving force, pushing him toward the one place where the past was concretely, brutally enshrined.

***

The Thorn Estate was not a house; it was a fortress of glass and steel grafted onto a cliff face. Leo’s hired car climbed the winding private road, each switchback revealing more stark, angular lines—a brutalist sculpture defying the soft, green hills.

*It’s a monument to cold capability,* he thought.

His scholarly unease from the previous day hardened into a visceral chill. This was not a place for theoretical ghosts. This was for the weight of tangible, hidden things.

The Channel wind buffeted the car. He tightened his grip on the wheel.

The final approach felt less like an arrival and more like entering a carefully laid trap. One he’d spent sixteen hours convincing himself he needed to spring.

He turned onto the rain-slicked drive, headlights cutting through a mist of salt and damp pine. The structure was lit from within by a cold, blue-white glow.

It looked less like a home. More like a surgical instrument.

He was met at the vast, pivoting front door not by a butler, but by a severe woman in a headset and a sleek black suit. “Mr. Vance. Your services are not required until tomorrow.” Her voice was digitally flat.

“I need to see Mr. Thorn. It’s urgent. A matter of life and death.”

“He is dining.”

“That’s exactly the problem!”

She eyed him with the disdain of a firewall scanning a virus. A whisper into her headset, a pause, then a curt nod. “Follow me.”

She led him through cavernous spaces of polished concrete and suspended art—twisted metal sculptures that echoed shipwrecks. The air was filtered, scentless, and cold. But as they neared the dining wing, another scent insinuated itself into the sterile atmosphere. It was rich, deep, and unmistakable.

Roasting meat. Not just meat—game. The high, iron-tinged scent of venison, the fattier perfume of wild boar, undercut with something darker, more feral. And spices: cloves studding flesh, the warm bark of cinnamon, the smoky whisper of grains of paradise.

Leo’s chef’s brain recognized it, even as his heart stuttered. It was the opening salvo of the menu he’d designed. The *Bruet of Venison with Saracen Spices*.

“He’s already started,” Leo said, his voice hollow.

The woman didn’t answer, swinging open a double door to the dining room.

The scene was a clash of epochs. The room was a glass box projecting over the cliff, the night sea a black void beyond. In its center, on a brutalist slab of black oak, a feast from a nightmare painting was in progress. Dozens of candles in wrought-iron holders guttered, casting frantic shadows on the faces of the two dozen guests in modern evening wear. They were laughing, their voices too loud, their eyes too bright.

At the head of the table sat Elias Thorn. He was a bull of a man, his jowls already glistening with grease and wine. In his hand, he held not a modern fork, but the handle of a medieval *trencher*—a thick slice of stale bread acting as a plate, sopping with rich, dark gravy.

He saw Leo and boomed a laugh, waving the sodden bread like a scepter. “Vance! The maestro himself! Come to inspect your work? A little early, but your gift was so thoughtfully timed!”

Leo froze just inside the door, the cloying, spiced air thick in his throat. “Gift?”

“The anonymous benefactor!” Thorn slurred, tearing a chunk of meat with his teeth. “Said you were indisposed but had prepared the first courses in advance as a surprise! Delivered this afternoon in a refrigerated van, with impeccable instructions for my staff! A magnificent gesture! This *bruet* is sublime! It tastes… it tastes of conquest!”

The guests murmured approval, their cutlery scraping against pewter replicas, not fine china. They were all consuming it. Every one of them.

Leo’s eyes swept the table. There were the planned dishes, arrayed in terrifying succession. The *Mortrews* of fish, the *Connynges in Gravey*, the *Flaunes* of pork… and at the far end, being kept warm on a massive silver *réchaud*, a covered dish of immense size. The shape beneath the domed lid was unmistakably avian, but wrong, elongated, with multiple protrusions.

*Cocatrice à l’Hydre*.

The killer wasn’t just here. The killer had delivered the poison himself, using Leo’s name, his menu, as the vehicle. He was in the room, watching. He had to be one of the flushed, laughing guests, or one of the silent servers in period-inspired livery moving like ghosts through the candlelight.

Leo’s warning died in his throat. It was too late. The ritual was in motion. The first course was already inside them, a time bomb of digestion. He met Thorn’s glazed, joyous eyes across the gulf of the table, across the centuries of culinary sin.

“Stop,” Leo whispered, but the word was lost in a roar of laughter as Thorn raised a goblet.

“To the chef!” Thorn bellowed. “And to the glorious, glorious feast!”

As the magnate drank, Leo saw a server—a young man with an impassive face—lean over and whisper in Thorn’s ear. Thorn’s eyes widened with delight. He slammed his goblet down. “The pièce de résistance! Now! Bring it now!”

The server moved to the *réchaud*. His hands, clad in white gloves, gripped the domed silver lid. He looked directly at Leo, and for a fleeting second, a smile touched his lips—a small, cold thing, like a slit in dough before it bakes.

With a theatrical flourish, he lifted the lid.

A plume of steam, fragrant with impossible spices and the sweet, sickly scent of seared, composite flesh, engulfed the end of the table. The creature revealed was a masterpiece of grotesquery: the body of a large capon, the tail of a pheasant, the wings of what might have been a goose, all stitched and trussed to appear as one monstrous, roasted beast. Its skin was lacquered a deep, perfect gold, glistening with a glaze of honey and something that looked like crushed amber.

It was the *Cocatrice*. The final course.

And Leo, from across the room, trapped in the claustrophobic sumptuousness of the scene, saw what none of the rapt, hungry guests seemed to notice. Along the seam where the pheasant tail was grafted to the capon’s body, the glaze had cracked. From within the crack, a faint, iridescent blue vapour, the colour of a kingfisher’s wing, whispered out, merging seamlessly with the aromatic steam.

The poison wasn’t in the food.

It was in the spectacle.
