Here is the expanded chapter:

The air inside the Thorn Estate tasted of old money and new fear. It was a specific flavor, Leo thought, as the heavy oak door shut behind him with a sound like a tomb sealing. Polished limestone underfoot, cold and echoing. The scent of beeswax and hothouse orchids, cloying and desperate. And beneath it, threading through the vast, over-decorated foyer, the faint, acrid tang of paranoia.

Julian Thorn awaited him in the grand salon, a room designed to intimidate. A thirty-foot ceiling vanished into shadow. A Titian glowered from one wall. Thorn himself was a spare man in an immaculate charcoal suit, perched on the edge of a Boulle chair as if it were a razor’s edge. His fingers, long and pale, drummed a silent, frantic rhythm on his knee.

“Vance.” The name was exhaled, not spoken. “You’re late.”

“Traffic,” Leo lied. The real delay had been a final, feverish cross-reference in his car, confirming his grim prediction: Thorn’s requested menu—a deceptively simple-sounding *Poulet au Miel et Lavande*—was, in its original 14th-century Provençal form, a ceremonial dish. It was served not with common honey, but with *miel fou*, “mad honey,” harvested from rhododendron flowers. In small doses, a euphoric; in the quantity a sauce would require, a neurotoxin causing paralysis, cardiac arrest.

The kitchen was a brutalist cathedral of stainless steel and black granite, a stark contrast to the antique opulence of the house. In its center, a stranger moved with quiet, lethal efficiency. He was tall, shrouded in a pristine white jacket, his face all sharp angles and deep hollows. His eyes, when they flicked up to meet Leo’s, were the color of dishwater. He didn’t speak. The only sounds were the hiss of a reducing stock and the precise *thock-thock-thock* of his knife on a board, mincing lavender.

“This is Chef Arto,” Thorn said, waving a dismissive hand. “He came highly recommended.”

Leo’s own knives, the familiar weight of them in their roll, felt like a useless anchor. He approached the central station. The ingredients were laid out with an almost surgical precision: the plump Bresse chicken, trussed; the bundle of Provençal lavender; a small, unlabeled jar of amber honey.

“May I?” Leo asked, reaching for the jar.

Arto’s hand shot out, covering his. The grip was cold, strong as a steel clamp. “The mise is set,” he said, his voice a low monotone. “Do not disturb.”

“Mr. Thorn,” Leo said, not breaking eye contact with the chef. “My terms for coming were explicit. I oversee. I taste. Every component.”

Thorn wrung his hands. “Is that necessary? The time—”

“It is the only reason I am here.” Leo put steel into his voice, the ghost of his old authority. “Or you can dine with your associate alone.”

A bead of sweat traced a path from Thorn’s temple to his jaw. He gave a tight, jerky nod.

Arto’s hand withdrew slowly. Leo unscrewed the jar. He dipped the tip of a small tasting spoon into the honey. He didn’t taste it yet. First, he smelled. The aroma was complex, floral, but with a faint, greenish undertone—a hint of damp earth and something vaguely medicinal. He touched a minuscule drop to the inside of his wrist, waited, felt a faint, unusual warmth. Finally, he brought the spoon to his lips.

The flavor bloomed: a burst of cloying sweetness, then a swift, aggressive bitterness that clawed at the back of his throat. A subtle numbness tingled on his tongue. His heart hammered against his ribs.

“This honey,” Leo said, his mouth dry. “Where did you source it?”

“A private apiary in the mountains,” Arto said, his gaze fixed on the chicken. “It is rare. Appropriate for the dish.”

“It’s toxic.” Leo turned to Thorn, whose face had gone the color of parchment. “Rhododendron honey. Even two tablespoons in the sauce would induce vomiting, dizziness, potentially fatal arrhythmias. This isn’t an ingredient. It’s a weapon.”

The silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the frantic drip of a tap. Thorn stared at the innocent-looking jar as if it were a coiled viper. His eyes darted to Arto, who had gone very still.

“You’re certain?” Thorn whispered.

“My palate,” Leo said flatly, “has never been wrong about poison.”

A strange sound escaped Arto—a sigh that was almost a hiss. He looked not at Thorn, but at Leo, and in those flat eyes, Leo saw a flash of something cold and appraising, the look of a master whose intricate work has been discovered by an unexpected connoisseur. Then, chaos.

With a sudden, violent sweep of his arm, Arto sent the heavy cast-iron skillet of hot stock flying across the range. It hit the controls. There was a spark, a *whump* of igniting gas, and a wall of flame roared up the stainless steel hood, greedily licking at the grease-caked filters.

“Fire!” Thorn shrieked, stumbling back.

Smoke, thick and black and smelling of burning fat and electronics, billowed forth, filling the kitchen with terrifying speed. The alarms screamed. Sprinklers erupted, a chaotic, drenching rain. In the strobe-like flash of the emergency lights and the orange dance of the flames, Leo lost sight of Arto. He lunged forward, not toward the exit, but toward the ingredient station, grabbing the toxic honey jar—evidence.

A shape barreled into him—Thorn, blind with panic, clawing his way to the door. They went down in a tangle of limbs on the wet floor. Leo’s head cracked against a cabinet handle. Stars exploded in his vision. By the time he shoved the sobbing mogul off him and staggered to his feet, the kitchen was a nightmare of steam, smoke, and cascading water. Arto was gone.

The fire, contained but vicious, was finally dying under the torrent from the sprinklers. The room was a wreck, dripping and scorched. Thorn, soaked and shaking, was being helped up by two wide-eyed security guards who had finally arrived.

“He tried to kill me!” Thorn jabbed a trembling finger at the spot where Arto had vanished.

Leo’s eyes scanned the room, searching for any sign of the chef. He spotted a small, almost imperceptible smudge of honey on the edge of the counter. He made a mental note to investigate further.

As the guards led Thorn away, Leo remained in the kitchen, surveying the damage. The air was thick with the acrid smell of smoke and the taste of fear. He knew that he had stumbled into something much larger than a simple poisoning plot. The game had just begun, and Leo was ready to play.

He took a deep breath, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that he had to get to the bottom of this, to uncover the truth behind the poisoned honey and the sinister forces that had orchestrated this attack. He was a man on a mission, driven by a burning desire for justice and a need to uncover the truth.

As he walked out of the kitchen, Leo couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced over his shoulder, but there was no one there. The feeling persisted, however, and he knew that he had to be careful. He was in a game of cat and mouse, and he had to stay one step ahead of his opponents.

Leo made his way back to his car, his mind racing with thoughts of the case. He knew that he had to get to the bottom of this, to uncover the truth behind the poisoned honey and the sinister forces that had orchestrated this attack. He was a man on a mission, driven by a burning desire for justice and a need to uncover the truth.

As he drove away from the Thorn Estate, Leo couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched. He glanced in his rearview mirror, but there was no one there. The feeling persisted, however, and he knew that he had to be careful. He was in a game of cat and mouse, and he had to stay one step ahead of his opponents.

Leo pulled out his phone and dialed a number. It was a number he knew well, a number that he had dialed many times before. It was the number of his old friend and colleague, Alex.

“Hey, Leo,” Alex said, answering on the first ring. “What’s up?”

“I need your help,” Leo said, his voice low and serious. “I’ve got a case that I need to crack, and I need your expertise.”

There was a pause on the other end of the line. “What kind of case?” Alex asked, his voice cautious.

“A poisoning plot,” Leo said, his voice firm. “I think it’s bigger than just a simple poisoning, though. I think it’s a conspiracy, and I need your help to uncover the truth.”

There was another pause on the other end of the line. “I’m in,” Alex said finally. “When do we start?”

Leo smiled, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. He knew that he had found the right person to help him crack this case. “Let’s meet up tomorrow at 9 am,” he said. “We’ll start digging into this thing and see where it takes us.”

“Sounds good to me,” Alex said. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”

Leo hung up the phone, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation. He knew that he was in for a wild ride, but he was ready for it. He was a man on a mission, driven by a burning desire for justice and a need to uncover the truth.

Leo pulled out his phone and dialed another number. It was a number he knew well, a number that he had dialed many times before. It was the number of his old friend and colleague, Rachel.

“Hey, Leo,” Rachel said, answering on the first ring. “What’s up?”


The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving in the early hours. The flickering streetlights cast long shadows, like skeletal fingers reaching out to snatch the unwary. It was a night that seemed to cling to the city like a damp shroud, weighing down the pavement and the buildings with its relentless, grey mist.

Inside the cramped, cluttered office of Ravenswood Investigations, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and yesterday's cigarette smoke. The walls were lined with dusty files and flickering fluorescent lights, casting an eerie glow over the cramped space. A lone, flickering computer screen cast an otherworldly light on the face of Emily Wilson, a petite, raven-haired woman with a sharp jawline and a look of perpetual exhaustion.

She sat hunched over the desk, her eyes fixed on the screen as she pored over a stack of documents. The words blurred together on the screen, a jumbled mess of names and dates and cryptic references to "Project Erebus." Emily's eyes narrowed as she read, her brow furrowed in concentration.

The door creaked open, and a tall, lanky man with a mop of unruly brown hair and a scattering of stubble across his chin walked in. He was dressed in a crumpled suit, the collar of his shirt open at the neck, and his eyes looked like they hadn't slept in days.

"Hey," he said, dropping into the chair opposite Emily's desk. "I'm running late. Traffic."

Emily raised an eyebrow, her eyes flicking to the clock on the wall. "You're always running late," she said, her voice dry.

The man, Leo, smiled wryly. "Hey, I resent that," he said. "I'm a punctual man."

Emily snorted. "Save it," she said. "You're a man who's always running late, and I'm a woman who's always waiting up for you."

Leo chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "That's not fair," he said. "I'm a man of my word."

Emily raised an eyebrow, her expression skeptical. "Really?" she said. "Then why are you always late?"

Leo shrugged, his shoulders rolling in a slow, languid motion. "I don't know," he said. "I guess I just like to take my time."

Emily sighed, her eyes rolling in exasperation. "You're a man of leisure," she said. "You have all the time in the world."

Leo grinned, his eyes sparkling with amusement. "That's true," he said. "But sometimes, I like to make the most of it."

The two of them sat in silence for a moment, the only sound the soft hum of the computer and the distant rumble of thunder outside. Then, without warning, Emily spoke up.

"Leo, I need to ask you something," she said, her voice low and serious.

"Anything," Leo said, his eyes locking onto hers.

"What's going on with you and Sarah?" Emily asked, her eyes narrowing. "You two seem to be working together on something, but I don't know what it is."

Leo's expression turned guarded, his eyes clouding over like a stormy sky. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said, his voice flat.

Emily raised an eyebrow, her eyes sparkling with amusement. "Don't play dumb with me, Leo," she said. "I know you two are working together. And I know you're hiding something from me."

Leo sighed, his shoulders rolling in a slow, defeated motion. "Okay, fine," he said. "We're working on a case. But it's not what you think."

Emily leaned forward, her eyes locked onto his. "Tell me," she said, her voice low and urgent.

Leo hesitated, his eyes darting around the room like a trapped animal. Then, without warning, he spoke up.

"It's about the Thorn Estate," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I've been hired to investigate some... irregularities."

Emily's eyes narrowed, her expression skeptical. "What kind of irregularities?" she asked, her voice dry.

Leo hesitated, his eyes clouding over like a stormy sky. "I'm not sure yet," he said. "But I have a feeling it's going to be big."

The two of them sat in silence for a moment, the only sound the soft hum of the computer and the distant rumble of thunder outside. Then, without warning, Emily spoke up.

"I'm in," she said, her voice low and serious. "When do we start?"

Leo smiled, his eyes sparkling with amusement. "Let's meet up tomorrow at 9 am," he said. "We'll start digging into this thing and see where it takes us."

As they made plans, the storm outside seemed to grow in intensity, the thunder booming and crackling like a living thing. Inside the cramped, cluttered office, the air was thick with anticipation, the sense of possibility hanging in the air like a challenge.

“I need your help,” Leo said, his voice low and serious. “I’ve got a case that I need to crack, and I need your expertise.”

There was a pause on the other end of the line. “What kind of case?” Rachel asked, her voice cautious.

“A poisoning plot,” Leo said, his voice firm. “I think it’s bigger than just a simple poisoning, though. I think it’s a conspiracy, and I need your help to uncover the truth.”

There was another pause on the other end of the line. “I’m in,” Rachel said finally. “When do we start?”
