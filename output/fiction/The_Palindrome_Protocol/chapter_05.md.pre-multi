Chapter 5: Personal Reflection

The rain had stopped, leaving London glazed under a pewter sky. In the incident room, the air was thick with stale coffee and frustration. Thorne stood before the map, its surface a constellation of red pins and black marker lines. The city was no longer just a geography; it was a manuscript, and someone was writing in a language of blood and bone.

Superintendent Riggs’s voice had been a blunt instrument over the phone an hour earlier. “You’re too close, Thorne. The synesthesia, the theories… it’s not procedure. I’m pulling you. Effective immediately. Hand everything to DCI Walsh.”

Thorne hadn’t argued. Arguing was for people who planned to obey. He’d simply placed the receiver back in its cradle, the click echoing in the silent, empty lab. Then he’d called Cruz.

Now, they worked in the borrowed light of a reading room at the British Library, surrounded by the ghostly breath of centuries of words. Their ‘unofficial’ command centre was a carrel littered with photographs, maps, and Thorne’s own notebooks, their margins crawling with his jagged, colour-coded script.

“Riggs thinks I’m seeing patterns in the tea leaves,” Thorne said, his voice low. He wasn’t looking at Cruz, but at the list of victims and their corresponding letters.

Oliver Hayes – O
Hannah Shaw – H
Benjamin Vale – B
Vivian Cross – V
Natalie Ames – N
Arthur Lloyd – A

“Maybe you are,” Cruz said, not unkindly. She was cleaning her glasses with a soft cloth, a habitual gesture that meant she was thinking. “But the tea leaves are all we have. What’s the latest from your… labyrinth?”

Thorne closed his eyes. The labyrinth was no longer a quiet, internal architecture. It had been colonized. The clean, geometric corridors now echoed with sensory ghosts: the coppery scent of Benjamin Vale’s studio, the cold, damp texture of the riverbank where they’d found Vivian Cross, the blinding, sterile white of Natalie Ames’s bathroom. His synesthesia, once a subtle translator, had become a relentless projector. The letter ‘V’ didn’t just feel sharp and taste of cold metal; it now sounded like Vivian’s last, wet gasp.

“It’s louder,” he admitted, opening his eyes. “The crime scenes have bled into it. The letters aren’t just symbols anymore. They’re… rooms. Chambers in his design. And mine.”

He took a fresh map of London, one not defaced by the task force’s pins. With a precise, clinical hand, he began to plot. Oliver Hayes, found in the symmetrical perfection of the Painted Hall, in Greenwich. Hannah Shaw, in the mirrored lobby of the Barbican. Benjamin Vale, in his studio in Shoreditch. Vivian Cross, on the south bank of the Thames, directly opposite the Houses of Parliament. Natalie Ames, in a flat in Mayfair. Arthur Lloyd, in his bookshop in Hampstead.

He connected the dots not by proximity, but by the sequence of the letters left behind. O to H to B to V to N to A.

The shape that emerged was not yet clear, but it was undeniably deliberate. It was a wide, arcing sweep across the city, a curve that seemed to be folding back on itself. It wasn’t a circle. It was a parabola, or one half of a grand, geographic ellipse.

“He’s not just killing them,” Thorne murmured, his finger tracing the invisible line. “He’s placing them. Like type in a typesetter’s case. Or notes on a stave.”

Cruz leaned in, her shoulder brushing his. He caught a faint scent of her perfume—jasmine, simple, real—a anchor in the swirling sensory storm. “A word, you said. Or a pattern. The letters spell nothing. OHBVNA. It’s nonsense.”

“To us. To him, it’s a foundation.” Thorne’s head throbbed. Behind his eyes, the letters danced in his labyrinth, each in its own painful colour. The O, a pulsing, deep blue ring. The H, two stark, vertical black bars. The B, a green that felt like mould. The V, a shard of violet lightning. The N, a rusty brown angle. The A, a sharp, arterial red triangle. They floated, disconnected, demanding order.

He took a clean sheet of paper and wrote the sequence vertically, down the left margin.

O
H
B
V
N
A

“He sees the world in reverse as well as forward,” Thorne said. “A palindrome isn’t just a line. It’s an axis. A mirror placed in the centre.” He drew a vertical line down the centre of the page. “The axis of symmetry.”

He began writing the letters again, this time horizontally, radiating out from the axis. He paired them, searching for the mirror. O opposite… O. H opposite… what mirrored H? His pen hovered. The labyrinth churned. The letters bled their sensations into his mind.

Then, it snapped.

It wasn’t a gradual realization. It was a visceral, geometric click, as if a magnetic lock in his brain had been engaged. The vertical axis he’d drawn in his mind for the labyrinth—the central spine of his own consciousness—suddenly aligned with the killer’s pattern. The letters didn’t need to be read left to right. They were a column. A column that could be rotated, reflected.

He wrote the sequence again, but now as a single string: OHBVNA.

Then, below it, he wrote it in reverse: ANVBHO.

He stared at the two lines. The killer’s mind wasn’t just working linearly. It was working in three dimensions, folding the sequence back on itself like a Möbius strip. The anagram wasn’t in the victims’ names alone. It was in the letters he left.

“Oh, God,” Thorne breathed.

“What?” Cruz’s voice was tight.

“It’s not just the names. It’s the letters. He’s not spelling a word with them. He’s making a word from them. The sequence is a pool of letters. He’s constructing something in the middle.” His hands were trembling slightly as he scrambled the letters of OHBVNA, rearranging them, testing them against the axis.

BOVHNA. VOHBAN. HANBOV. None fit. None felt symmetrical.

The axis demanded balance. The centre point. If the pattern held, the next victim, the next letter, would be the fulcrum. The mirror point.

His mobile buzzed, a harsh, electronic vibration that shattered his concentration. The caller ID was blocked. He exchanged a glance with Cruz and answered.

“Yes?”

The voice on the other end was not the Superintendent’s. It was calm, cultured, and utterly devoid of life, like a text-to-speech program reading a love poem. It had a strange, flattened quality, digitally altered, but the precision of the diction was chilling.

“Detective Inspector Thorne. You are looking at the map. You are connecting the dots. Do you see the curve?”

Thorne’s blood turned to ice. He motioned frantically for Cruz to get tech on it. She was already texting, her face pale.

“Who is this?”

“A fellow cartographer. You appreciate symmetry. I know this. The labyrinth in your mind… is it beautiful today? Or is it cluttered with the wrong colours?”

Thorne’s breath caught. No one knew about the labyrinth. No one but his old therapist, and Cruz, whom he’d told in a moment of exhausted vulnerability.

“What do you want?”

“I want you to understand it. Truly understand it. You look at the victims, at the letters, and you seek a pattern out there. But the first symmetry is always personal. Look at your own life, Inspector. The axis runs through you, too. The failed marriage. The estranged sister. The career built on order, to compensate for the chaotic wiring of your own senses. You seek my pattern to avoid seeing your own.”

The words were scalpels, probing old, tender scars with clinical accuracy. Thorne felt exposed, as if the caller was in the room, reading from his private files.

“You’re not a prophet,” Thorne said, forcing steel into his voice. “You’re a murderer. Your pattern is just a trail of gore.”

A soft, electronic sigh. “Gore is organic. It decays. I work with purer materials. Names. Letters. Ideas. The victims… they are the clay. The palindrome is the ideal form. I am merely the sculptor, removing the excess.”

“Why contact me?”

“Because you are the only one trying to read the sculpture, not just count the chips on the floor. The task force sees accidents. You see design. But
