Greer's voice was a hesitant whisper, as if the words themselves were a fragile, crumbling structure that might collapse at any moment. "He... he was taken. By A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City). They needed him, you see. They needed his genius, his vision. They took him, and they... they made him one of them."

Thorne's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with the implications. "What do you mean?"

Greer's eyes darted around the room, as if searching for an escape route. "They... they changed him. They made him into a tool, a machine. They took his creativity, his passion, and they... they channeled it into something else. Something... symmetrical."

Cruz leaned forward, her voice low and urgent. "What happened to him, Mr. Greer? What did they do to him?"

Greer's face contorted in a mixture of pain and fear. "They... they broke him. They broke his spirit, his soul. They took away his free will, his creativity. They made him into a... a puppet, a slave to their symmetry."

Thorne's mind reeled as he processed the implications. Alistair Hovenab, the brilliant architect, had been taken by A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City) and transformed into a tool for their sinister purposes. The murders, the palindromes, the symmetry – it all made sense now. The killer was not just a madman, but a product of A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s twisted vision.

As they left Greer's apartment, Thorne couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched, that A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City) itself was observing them, waiting for them to uncover the truth. The rain continued to fall, casting a gloomy shadow over the streets, but Thorne knew that the real darkness lay within A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s twisted heart.

As they walked back to the task force room, Cruz turned to Thorne with a look of determination. "We need to find out what happened to Hovenab. We need to know what A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City) did to him, and how we can stop him."

Thorne nodded, his mind racing with the possibilities. "I think I know where to start. Let's pay a visit to A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s archives. I have a feeling that we're going to find some... interesting documents."

The city's archives were a labyrinthine complex of dusty shelves and forgotten files. Thorne and Cruz navigated the narrow aisles, their footsteps echoing off the walls as they searched for any mention of Alistair Hovenab. Finally, after what seemed like hours of searching, they stumbled upon a hidden room deep in the archives.

 Inside, they found a series of files, bound in black leather and adorned with strange symbols. Thorne's heart sank as he opened the first file, revealing a series of documents that detailed A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s experiments on Hovenab. The files were cryptic, but one phrase stood out: "Project Symmetry: Phase II – Human Subject 001."

Thorne's eyes locked onto the phrase, his mind racing with the implications. "This is it," he whispered to Cruz. "This is what we've been searching for. We need to get this to the DA, now."

As they left the archives, Thorne couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched, that A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City) itself was waiting for them to uncover the truth. The rain continued to fall, casting a gloomy shadow over the streets, but Thorne knew that the real darkness lay within A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s twisted heart.

The DA's office was a fortress of steel and glass, a symbol of A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s power and corruption. Thorne and Cruz arrived just as the sun was setting, casting a golden glow over A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City). They were greeted by the DA's assistant, a young woman with a look of determination.

"Can I help you?" she asked, her voice firm.

Thorne handed her the files, his eyes locked onto hers. "We need to see the DA. We have evidence of a conspiracy, a cover-up that goes all the way to the top."

The assistant's eyes widened as she scanned the files, her face pale. "I'll take you to the DA," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

As they waited in the DA's office, Thorne couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched, that A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City) itself was waiting for them to uncover the truth. The rain continued to fall, casting a gloomy shadow over the streets, but Thorne knew that the real darkness lay within A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s twisted heart.

Finally, the DA emerged from his office, a look of determination on his face. "I've read the files," he said, his voice firm. "I believe you. We need to take action, now."

Thorne nodded, his mind racing with the possibilities. "We need to expose A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s corruption, to bring the truth to light. We need to stop the killer, and we need to stop A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s sinister plans."

The DA nodded, his eyes locked onto Thorne's. "I'll do everything in my power to help you. We'll take down A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s corrupt officials, and we'll bring justice to the victims."

As they left the DA's office, Thorne couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched, that A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City) itself was waiting for them to uncover the truth.

Thorne and Cruz knew that they had to act fast, to expose the truth and bring A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)'s corrupt officials to justice.
