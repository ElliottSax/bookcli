Thorne's hand shook as he wrote the mirrored sequence. The letters on the right side of the axis were the inverted reflections of the left. O mirrored O. H mirrored... not H, but something else. The killer was playing with the symmetry, bending the rules of the palindrome. The H was mirrored not by another H, but by a U. The B mirrored a Q. The V mirrored a C. The N mirrored a Z. The A mirrored an X.
