Chapter 3: The Ava Gambit

Stale coffee, the ozone of overheating projectors, and the sharp scent of dry-erase markers thickened the air in the Incident Room, transforming it into a cathedral of dread. Across one wall sprawled a terrifying mosaic. Photographs of the victims—Otto Green, Hannah Lee, and the newly confirmed Eve Caravelle—formed a column of pale islands in a sea of red string, maps, and frantic script. On a separate board, Aris Thorne’s labyrinth model grew like a crystalline fungus, its geometric lines and nodes drawn with a draughtsman’s precision.

Motionless before it, Thorne stood with a piece of white chalk poised in his fingers. For ten minutes he had been silent, tracing invisible paths in the air while the rest of the task force—Detective Chen, a handful of uniforms, and the newly assigned FBI liaison, Special Agent Curtis—buzzed with strained energy around him.

“The list.” Chen’s voice cut through the murmur. She slapped a printout onto the central table, a waterfall of names fanning out. “Every resident in the tri-county area with a palindromic first name. Four hundred and eighty-seven. Otto, Hannah, and Eve are here.” Her red pen circled three names, the ink like blood.

Built like a refrigerator with a haircut to match, Agent Curtis scowled. “This is the profile? A spelling bee? He’s picking people because their parents had a fondness for symmetry?”

“He’s not ‘picking’ them.” Thorne’s low rumble came without turning. Finally, the chalk touched the board, adding a new node to his labyrinth. It sat above and to the left of the others, connected by a diagonal line. “He’s visiting them. Like stations on a pilgrimage. The name is the gate. The murder is the ritual. The arrangement… the arrangement is the prayer.”

Turning, his shadowed eyes scanned the list, their intellectual fervor burning too bright, too cold. “The sequence isn’t alphabetical. It’s not chronological by victim. It’s spatial and conceptual. Otto was the center. A locked room, a perfect, still point. Hannah was motion—the fall, the shattered symmetry of the body on the stairs. Eve was consumption, the pattern internalized, literally eaten. He’s moving through ideas. Through a logic we perceive as disorder.”

Leaning over the list, Chen frowned. “So we can’t just guard the next name alphabetically after ‘Eve’.”

“No. We must consider the pressure in the system. The pattern wants to resolve.” Thorne’s gaze swept the names. “He’s moved from the ontological center, to kinetic energy, to internal dissolution. What’s the inverse of consumption? Not regurgitation. Projection. Expression.” His chalk-dusted finger landed on a name halfway down the page. “Ava. A-V-A. A voice. A sound. The first utterance. A palindrome of perfect balance, the V as its axis.”

“Ava Mercer.” Chen pulled up a file on her laptop, the key clicks unnaturally loud. “Thirty-two. Local news reporter for Channel 7. Did a human-interest segment on… Otto Green. Two weeks before his death. ‘The Quiet Genius of Local Horticulture.’” Color drained from her face. “She interviewed him. She was in his house.”

The room stilled, the hum of the computers swelling in the silence.

“He watches the coverage.” Thorne murmured. “Of course. The ritual isn’t private. It needs a witness, even an oblivious one. She didn’t just report on Otto. She became part of the narrative. She’s the echo.”

Shifting his bulk, Agent Curtis grunted. “So we put her under protection. Round-the-clock. We use her as bait, but in a sealed jar.”

A slow, pendulum shake of Thorne’s head. “He’ll know. He’s anticipated our linearity. A direct, obvious guard detail is a wall in his labyrinth. He’ll simply find another path, and we’ll lose him.” Staring at the model, his mind raced through the permutations. “We don’t just guard Ava Mercer. We create a perimeter of misdirection. Identify every ‘Ava’ within a twenty-mile radius. Put casual, visible watches on three of them—obvious unmarked cars, a patrol car drive-by every hour. For Ava Mercer, we do the opposite. We make her safehouse invisible.”

He outlined the plan with clinical detail. Ava Mercer would be extracted from her downtown apartment under the cover of a fake gas leak scare, then installed in her sister’s vacant row house in the historic, maze-like Bramble Court district—a place not listed in any easily accessible database. Electronic surveillance only. No visible officers. The killer, drawn to the obvious staked-out decoys, would either reveal himself or be confounded.

Chen argued for heavier protection, but Thorne remained adamant. “We are not dealing with a brute force predator. We are dealing with a composer. We must play the notes he doesn’t expect.”

Bramble Court was a relic, a cobblestoned cul-de-sac where old-fashioned gas-style globes cast pools of buttery, inadequate light. The houses stood tall and narrow, pressed together like nervous spines. Ava Mercer’s temporary safehouse was the end unit, its small rear garden backing onto a tangled, city-owned thicket.

From a van parked three streets over, Thorne and Chen watched the feeds: crisp, black-and-white visions of emptiness. The silent living room with its sheet-draped furniture, the dark kitchen, the narrow staircase leading to the bedroom where Ava was, presumably, trying to sleep. A camera hidden in a smoke detector watched the front door from the inside. Another, in a birdhouse facing the back garden, showed the overgrown patch of lawn and the sagging wooden gate.

Only the hollow hum of an empty house and the occasional, muffled sound of pacing from upstairs came through the audio feed.

Hours into the shift, Chen whispered, “It feels wrong.” The van smelled of cold metal, synthetic carpet, and their shared anxiety. “Leaving her that alone.”

“She’s not alone,” Thorne said, his eyes fixed on the screens. “We are here. He is not. That is the optimal equation.”

But the equation was flawed. They had calculated for a killerwho sought confrontation or who would be lured by a symbol. They had not calculated for one who understood surveillance itself as a medium.

At 2:17 AM, the back garden feed flickered.

Not a figure. Not a shadow. It was a subtle change in the texture of the darkness. The overgrown foxgloves near the back fence seemed to shiver, though there was no wind.

“Chen,” Thorne said, his voice a taut wire.

“I see it. A cat? The light…”

Then, the back gate—unlocked, they’d checked it themselves—swung inward an inch. And stopped. On the screen, it was a minimal shift, a slight alteration in the angle of a vertical line. Nothing breached the threshold.

For five minutes, nothing moved. The tension in the van was a physical thing, pressing on their eardrums.

Then, the front door camera.

A shape filled the fish-eye lens, distorted and sudden. A man, his back to the camera, standing on the front step. He wore a dark, long coat. His hair was neat, nondescript. He didn’t try the handle. He didn’t peer through the sidelight. He simply stood there, as if listening to the house breathe.

Ava’s pacing upstairs stopped.

The figure on the front step raised a hand. In it was not a tool, not a weapon, but a small, rectangular card. He bent, with a strange, formal grace, and slid it under the door. The white rectangle appeared on the dark floorboards of the foyer, stark as a scar.

Then he turned. The camera caught his profile for a fraction of a second—a plain, forgettable face, glasses, a look not of malice but of profound, unsettling focus—before he stepped out of frame, walking calmly away.

“Go!” Thorne barked, already throwing open the van door. Chen was on the radio, screaming for backup and an ambulance, her professionalism shattered by the visceral horror of the violation. The safehouse wasn’t safe. It had never been safe. It had been the chosen stage.

They crashed into the row house, weapons drawn, shouting Ava’s name. The interior was cold, the still air now pregnant with threat. Thorne’s eyes went to the card on the floor. He left it, taking the stairs two at a time.

Ava Mercer was in the bedroom, backed into a corner, a baseball bat clutched in shaking hands. She was a woman made of angles and wide, terror-glazed eyes. She saw Thorne’s badge and didn’t relax; the scream just coiled tighter inside her.

“He was here,” she gasped. “At the front. I saw his shadow through the window. I heard… a scratch.”

“Did he enter? Did you see him?”

“No. No, he just… stood there.”

Chen secured the room as Thorne went back downstairs, his heart a cold, heavy stone in his chest. He approached the front door. From the outside, it looked pristine. It was only when he stood directly before it, his own breath fogging the painted wood, that he saw it.

Centered at eye-level, nailed with a single, small brass nail, was a piece of polished steel, cut into a shape. It was a letter ‘V’. But it was mirrored. The left side reflected the right perfectly. It was a palindrome of form, not just text. It caught the dim hall light and threw it back, warped and cruel.

He didn’t touch it. He turned and looked at the card on the floor. Using a pen from his pocket, he flipped it over.

It was a plain piece of high-quality ivory stock. Typed on it, in a classic Courier font, was a single, stark sentence:

A VA REED

The space was intentional. It broke her name into a new palindrome. ‘Ava’ became a fragment, framing the central, shrieking command: REED. A fragile, hollow tube. An instrument that requires breath to make sound.

He bagged it, his hands steady but his mind reeling. The killer hadn’t come to kill. He’d come to deliver a message. To correct their understanding.

Backup swarmed the house and the surrounding streets, but Thorne knew they would find nothing. The killer had dissolved back into A major, rain-slicked metropolis (implied to be New York City)’s grid, his point made.

In the sterile brightness of the Incident Room an hour later, Ava Mercer, wrapped in a grey police-issue blanket, sat shivering. The shock had subsided, leaving a raw, intelligent fear. She was a reporter. She understood narrative. And she knew she was now trapped in one.

“He gave you a note,” Thorne said, kneeling before her, his voice softer than Chen had ever heard it. “The one under the door. Did he give you anything else? At any other time?”

Ava’s eyes, red-rimmed and huge, focused on him. She nodded, a tiny, brittle motion. “Yesterday. At my real apartment. Before you moved me. It was in my mailbox. Typed. I thought it was a weird fan letter. It didn’t make sense, so I threw it away.”

Thorne’s blood went still. “What did it say, Ava? Try to remember exactly.”

She closed her eyes, her reporter’s memory clicking in, despite the terror. She recited it, her voice a flat, haunted monotone:

“‘You are not the center. You are the axis. The sound turns. It will come back for you.’”

The words hung in the air, freezing the room.

You are not the center. You are the axis.

The killer hadn’t been outmaneuvered. He had orchestrated their entire operation. He had let them scurry, let them set up their decoys and their invisible safehouse, all the while knowing exactly where Ava was. He had watched them, studied their moves, and then had walked directly to their queen, not to take her, but to tap the glass of her cage. He had proven their protection was a fiction, their logic a child’s sketch compared to his master blueprint.

Ava was not a target to be killed. Not yet. She was a pivot. A fulcrum. The ‘V’ around which the next phase would turn.

Thorne stood, his bones feeling ancient. He looked at his labyrinth model on the wall. He saw it now, the arrogance of his own design. He had drawn the paths, but the killer was the Minotaur, and he was not lost in the labyrinth—he was the labyrinth. And Ava’s words were the key to a more terrifying truth: the killer’s pattern wasn’t just progressing. It was revolving*. It was going to turn back on itself.

The hook was no longer a question of who would be next. It was a dreadful, gathering certainty.

The sound was turning. And it was all coming back.
