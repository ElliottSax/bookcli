  "premise": "A meticulous serial killer is targeting victims whose names are palindromes, leaving behind a single mirrored letter at each scene. Detective Aris Thorne, a synesthete who sees time as a spatial labyrinth, must decipher the killer's obsession with symmetry before the pattern completes itself with a final, catastrophic victim whose name reads the same forward, backward, and upside down.",
  "protagonist": "Detective Aris Thorne, a brilliant but isolated synesthete whose condition allows him to perceive patterns in time and evidence that others miss, but who struggles with the overwhelming sensory noise of a modern city.",
  "conflict": "Thorne must race against a mathematically-precise killer who believes he is restoring balance to a chaotic world, while battling his own department's skepticism of his unconventional methods and the personal toll of his sensory perceptions being weaponized by the case.",
  "setting": "Present-day Boston, specifically its historic districts and modern tech corridors, during a relentlessly gray New England autumn.",
  "tone": "Cerebral, tense, and atmospheric, blending the clinical precision of forensic investigation with the unsettling, almost poetic obsession of the killer, creating a mood of intellectual dread."
