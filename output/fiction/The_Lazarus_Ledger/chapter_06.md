Chapter 6: Going Underground

CHAPTER SIX: GOING UNDERGROUND

The rain on Transitory Spaces: Taxis, safe houses, airport lounges—places of movement and impermanence. window blurred London into a smear of sodium-orange and bruised purple. Elena watched the digits on the fare meter tick upward with a cold, detached focus. Each click was a unit of her old life, spent and gone. Her phone, a dead slab of glass and metal, lay in her lap. She had powered it down after the last call, the one from her brother, Leo. His voice, trying so hard to be brave, had been the final thread connecting her to the person she used to be.
“They came to the flat, El,” he’d said, the words rushed, hushed. “Two men. Asked if I’d heard from you. Said it was a welfare check from your employer. They were… polite. Too polite.”

That was three hours ago. In the intervening time, Elena had become a ghost. She’d walked out of her own life with nothing but a backpack containing a change of clothes, a burner phone, four passports in different names, and £8,000 in used notes from a safety deposit box her father had insisted she open a decade ago. “For a rainy day, kotik,” he’d replied, his rough engineer’s hands closing hers over the key. This wasn’t rain. This was a flash flood.
“Here’s fine,” she told the driver, her voice unfamiliar to her own ears. They were in Camden, away from the cameras of the city centre. She handed over a twenty, told him to keep the change, and stepped into the damp, diesel-scented night. The taxi pulled away, its red taillights swallowed by the traffic. She stood for a full minute, feeling the vulnerability of a stationary target, before moving.
She walked for six blocks, the backpack a lead weight, her senses hyper-alert. The flicker of a CCTV camera made her neck prickle. A man walking his dog appeared to slow his pace. Paranoia is just pattern recognition applied to your own survival, she thought, a mantra she’d adopted since finding the abandoned retreat in Norway. She ducked into a 24-hour internet café, the air thick with the smell of stale coffee and teenage anxiety. In a corner booth, she paid cash for an hour.
Her fingers flew over the keyboard, accessing a series of encrypted cloud lockers, using passphrases constructed from half-remembered lines of Pushkin and her mother’s maiden name. This was the hidden backup—the Lazarus Ledger, Version Zero. Not the sanitized spreadsheets she’d presented to the Foundation’s board, but the raw, messy data she’d compiled in the beginning: donor lists cross-referenced with shell companies, flight manifests, property holdings in jurisdictions that didn’t ask questions.
On another tab, she pulled up news archives. Not the financial pages, but the dark underbelly of the global news cycle: short articles about a village in the Democratic Republic of Congo where a mysterious haemorrhagic fever had killed 300 before vanishing from reports; a investigative journalist in Buenos Aires found dead in an apparent robbery, his notes on a privatized water scheme missing; a groundbreaking paper on room-temperature superconductivity retracted by its authors without explanation.
Before, she had looked at the who. The donors. The Lazarus Candidates. Now, she looked for the why. The cost. The silence purchased.
She draw lines, her clinical analyst’s mind divorcing itself from the horror of the connections. Donor #47, a petrochemical billionaire from Saudi Arabia. His ‘death’ and Lazarus relocation coincided perfectly with the suppression of a UN report detailing his company’s role in a catastrophic oil spill that had poisoned an entire coastline in Southeast Asia. The report had been buried, the activist lawyer leading the case had ‘disappeared’ while hiking. The billionaire’s Foundation donation? A conveniently timed $50 million for marine conservation.
Donor #12, a former Eastern European intelligence chief. His Lazarus event dovetailed with the assassination of a reformist politician who had been compiling evidence of state-sanctioned death squads. The investigation died with the politician. The Foundation had received a generous ‘bequest’ from the intelligence chief’s ‘estate’.
It wasn’t philanthropy. It was a laundering service. Not for money, but for consequence. The Foundation was a metaphysical offshore account. You paid your dues in blood and secrets, and they gave you a new ledger, starting at zero. Your past atrocities became non-performing assets, written off. The world’s worst evils weren’t just hidden; they were the foundational capital, the dark matter upon which this gleaming edifice of benevolence was constructed.
A dry heave rose in Elena’s throat. She swallowed it down, the taste bitter. She had been a custodian of this. She had optimized it.
She opened the burner phone and made the call she’d been dreading. It rang once, twice.
“Hello?” Leo’s voice.
“It’s me. Don’t say my name. Listen. You have two hours. Pack a bag. Essentials only. Go to Victoria, the mainline station. Lockers. You remember the code from Dad’s birthday?”

A pause. She could hear his breathing quicken. “Yeah. I remember.”

“There’s a key taped under the third bench from the left, near the ticket office for the Gatwick Express. It opens locker 214. Inside is another key, cash, and a train ticket to Penzance. Go there. A woman named Martha will meet you at the station. She has a cottage. You stay there. You tell no one. You are sick, you are grieving a breakup, you are writing a novel—I don’t care. You vanish.”

“Elena… what did you do?” His whisper was frayed with fear.
“My job,” she said, the words ash in her mouth. “Too well. I love you. I will find you when it’s safe.”

“How will you know?”

“I won’t,” she answered, and ended the call. She removed the SIM card, snapped it, and dropped the pieces into separate bins on her way out. The severance was complete. A surgical amputation. The coldness of the act settled into her bones.
For three days, Elena moved through the city’s interstices. She slept in a different budget hotel each night, paying cash, using a passport that identified her as Klara Schmidt, a German graphic designer. She ate prepackaged sandwiches from supermarkets, her appetite gone. The paranoia was a constant companion, a chemical buzz in her bloodstream. Every reflection in a shop window was a potential tail. Every ringtone was a knell.
Her work continued in libraries, in cafés, on the stolen Wi-Fi of anonymous businesses. The Ledger was now a map of calamity. Each Lazarus donor was a sinkhole into which some truth had collapsed. A cured cancer was linked to a donor whose pharmaceutical company had buried data on fatal side effects. A revived ancient forest project was funded by a mining magnate whose illegal operations had levelled an entire ecosystem elsewhere.
The scale was vertiginous. It wasn’t a conspiracy in the sense of a smoky room and a grand plan. It was an ecosystem. The Foundation provided a necessary service for a certain tier of monster: existential crisis management. When your sin was too vast to be buried by conventional means, when the reckoning was at the door, they offered you the ultimate escape clause. Die. Be reborn. Your legacy, carefully curated by their PR machine, becomes one of generosity. Your poison is transformed, through alchemy, into medicine.
On the fourth day, hunched over a terminal in the basement of the British Library, she found him.
Dr. Aris Thorne. Founder and CEO of Vektor Glyph, a biotech firm hailed as a pioneer in rapid-response vaccine development. Forty-eight years old. Photogenic, charismatic, a frequent TED talker. Recently, a whisper campaign had begun. A leak from a contract research organization in West Africa. Rumours of a Phase III trial for a novel meningitis vaccine that had gone catastrophically wrong. Over two hundred children dead, the data manipulated, the local officials paid off. A crusading NGO was weeks, maybe days, from publishing a forensic report. Thorne had denied everything vehemently, calling it a smear campaign by anti-vaxxers.
Elena pulled up his financials. Clean. Too clean. His philanthropic giving was modest, public. No obvious link to New York Citythe estate.
But then she glanced not at his money, but at his life. She cross-referenced his calendar, his travel, with the Foundation’s known operational patterns. Eight months ago, Thorne had taken a sudden, unpublicized ‘wellness retreat’ to a private island in the Seychelles. Satellite imagery showed a compound matching the architecture of the Norwegian waystation. Six weeks ago, he had transferred the majority of his personal art collection—valued at over $200 million—into a blind trust with a fiduciary entity that, after three layers of dissection, Elena traced back to a Luxembourg holding company used by the Foundation to manage ‘incoming assets.’

Then, the clincher. A paragraph deep in a year-old society column: Thorne had been diagnosed with a rare, inoperable cardiomyopathy. A death sentence. The column wished him well. In all subsequent interviews, Thorne looked vibrant, healthy. He’d spoken of a revolutionary new treatment in Switzerland.
Elena’s blood turned to ice. He wasn’t sick anymore. He had traded his death.
The timeline was clear. The NGO report was the ticking clock. Once it hit, Thorne’s reputation, his company, his freedom would be obliterated. He was a perfect candidate. A man on the brink of exposure for an atrocity that would shock the world, with the means to pay, and a pre-existing, plausible medical reason to die.
He was next. The Foundation was preparing to make Aris Thorne disappear, and resurrect him as a saint.
She had to move. But to where? To whom? The police were out—her own credentials were suspended, and the Foundation’s reach was clearly supra-governmental. The press? She had no proof, only a web of inferences a journalist would need months to verify. Thorne had days, maybe hours.
There was only one source left: the origin point. The donor’s sister, Magda. The woman who had received the letter from beyond the grave. She was the only living person Elena had met who had touched this machinery and wasn’t part of it. She lived in Wrocław.
Elena booked a one-way ticket on a budget airline under another name, paying with cash at a travel agent’s. The flight left at dawn.
The safe house was a flat above a kebab shop in a nondescript part of Warsaw—she’d disembarked early, taking a series of buses to throw off any possible pattern. The room smelled of grease and damp plaster. She lay on a single bed, listening to the thump of bass from the shop below, and stared at the water-stained ceiling.
Her mind wouldn’t quiet. It replayed the connections, the elegant, horrifying logic of the Foundation. It was the ultimate hedge fund, shorting on human conscience. They bet on the inevitability of monstrous men being caught, and offered them the only commodity that mattered: a new timeline.
A memory surfaced, unbidden. Her first week at the Foundation. A senior partner, a man with kind eyes named Charles, had taken her to lunch. “We deal in second chances, Elena,” he’d said, sipping his mineral water. “The world is unforgiving. We provide a… softer landing.” She had thought it beautiful. Now she understood. The landing was soft for the falling angel. Not for the people they’d crushed on the way down.
She slept fitfully, dreaming of ledgers where the numbers bled, and of her brother’s face, fading like a signal lost.
The next morning, she took a train to Wrocław. Magda, the donor’s sister, lived in a communist-era apartment block, its concrete face stained with decades of pollution. Elena approached with a rodent’s caution, circling the block twice, watching windows, noting the single old man tending pigeons on a bench.
She knocked. The door opened a crack, a chain still secured. Magda’s eyes, red-rimmed and wary, peered out. They widened in recognition, then fear.
“You,” she breathed in Polish.murmuredey said you would come. They said you would bring troubwhispered

“Who said?” Elena asked, her Polish slow, formal.
“Men. After you visited. Asking questions. Polite, like you.” Magda made to shut the door.
“Please. I know what happened to your brother. I know he’s not dead. Not the way you think.”

The door stopped. Magda’s eyes searched Elena’s face, looking for the lie, finding only a reflection of her own exhausted desperation. The chain rattled, and the door swung open.
The apartment was a shrine to loss. Photographs of a smiling man—the donor—at every age. The air was thick with the smell of boiled cabbage and old grief. Magda didn’t offer tea.
“He sent another letter,” she said abruptly, her back to Elena as she stared out the grimy window. “A week ago. Postmarked from… Mauritius.” She laughed, a short, broken sound. “He always wanted to go.”

“What did it say?”

“Nothing. Everything. It was a birthday card for my daughter. His statedwriting. It said, ‘Tell Anya her uncle thinks of her. I am at peace. The sun is warm.’” Magda turned, her face a mask of fury and agony. “He is at peace? He is at peace? While I mourned? While I buried an empty box?”

“The letter,” Elena pressed, gently. “Do you have it?”

Magda hesitated, then shuffled to a sideboard, pulling a simple birthday card from a drawer. She handed it to Elena as if it were contaminated.
Elena examined it. A generic card with tropical flowers. The message was brief, handwritten. But it was the paper that caught her eye. Thick, high-quality. She held it to the weak light from the window. Nothing. She ran a finger over the Foundation logo embossed on the back of the envelope—a stylized ‘L’ entwined with a phoenix. Standard. Then, almost absently, she brought the card close to her face and inhaled.
A scent. Faint, almost gone. Not Magda’s perfume, or the smell of the apartment. Something clean, medicinal, and beneath it, a hint of something else… aloe vera, and ozone. The exact same combination she had smelled in the pristine, abandoned bathrooms of the Norwegian waystation. A proprietary soap, perhaps. A signature.
“He’s telling you he’s alive,” Elena said. “And he’s telling you where. This smell… it’s from a place. A Foundation place.”

“Why?” Magda whispered. “Why torture me like this?”

“Because he’s not allowed to contact you. This is him breaking the rules. A tiny rebellion. He wants you to know.” Elena’s mind was racing. Mauritius. A known jurisdiction for discreet wealth. A possible endpoint, not a waystation. “Magda, I need your help. The people who did this… they’re about to do it again. For a man who killed children. I can’t let it happen.”

“What can I do? I am an old woman in a flat.”

“You have his letters. You have his life before. You are proof the system isn’t perfect. They couldn’t make you forget.” Elena took a risk. “Come with me. To the authorities. To the media. Your story, with what I have…”

Magda’s face closed. “And then what? They make me disappear too? Or make it look like I fell down the stairs? No. You leave. You take your war and you go. I have my daughter. I have this ghost of a brother. It is all I have left.”

The resignation in her voice was absolute. Elena saw the Foundation’s true victory: not simply in hiding people, but in silencing those left behind through a cocktail of fear, confusion, and the sheer, soul-crushing weirdness of the truth.
Defeated, Elena handed back the card. As she did, a sliver of paper, thin as a razor blade, fluttered from where it had been tucked behind the inner fold. It landed on the linoleum floor.
Both women stared at it.
Elena bent and picked it up. It was a receipt. For a boat charter. Le Morne, Mauritius. Date: two days from now. Vessel: “Aeolus.” Time: 0700. Paid in cash.
On the back, in the same handwriting, two words: Forgive me.
Magda’s hand flew to her mouth. Her brother wasn’t just sending comfort. He was sending a coordinate. A time. A chance.
Elenagazedd from the slip of paper to Magda’s horrified eyes. The Foundation’s flaw was human sentiment. A brother’s guilt. A sister’s love. It was a crack, microscopic, but real.
“They’re mremarkedg him,” Elena said, her voice low and urgent. “This receipt is for a transfer. From a safe house to a more permanent location, probably a ship or a private island. He’s giving you a window. A final chance to see he’s alive.”

“Or it is a trap,” Magda said, but the hope in her voice was a painful thing to hear.
“Maybe,” Elena conceded. But it was the only thread she had. Aris Thorne was being prepared for his death. This donor, years into his Lazarus life, was risking everything to send a signal. The beginning and the end of the process, connected by this fragile paper trail.
She had to get to Mauritius. She had to intercept that boat. The donor on it was a link, a potential witness who could blow the entire operation wide open. And if the Foundation was in its final stages with Thorne, their protocols would be at their most intense, and potentially, their most vulnerablenotedI’m going,” Elena said, folding the receipt into her pocket.
“You will die,” Magda stated, not unkindly.
“Not before I see his face,” Elena replied. “Not before I get the truth.”

She left Magda standing amid the ghosts of her family, a still point in the turning world. Outside, the air was cold and sharp. Elena pulled her coat tight and melted into the flow of pedestrians, her mind already moving through logistics: passports, routes, currencies. The paranoid buzz had crystallized into a single, focused frequency: Mauritius. Le Morne. 0700. The “Aeolus.”

She had a date with a ghost. And on the horizon, another man was preparing to die, so that his sins could live forever, purified by a foundation built on bones.
The race was no longe merely st for truth. It was for a soul, stepping off a boat in the morning sun, before it could vanish into the light forever.
