Chapter 2: The First Thread

The key to the west tower was iron, cold and heavy, and it fought the lock with a grudging, metallic shriek that echoed in the stone throat of the stairwell. Elara flinched, the sound too much like a warning. Mrs. Pugh had handed it over after a silent breakfast of porridge and strong tea, her eyes fixed on the rain-streaked window. “You’ll find it as it was left,” was all she’d said, the Welsh lilt flattening the words into a statement of grim fact, not promise.

The air in the tower was different. Not just stale, but still, as if it had been waiting. It smelled of dust, yes, and the faint, sweet decay of old wood, but underneath was something else: a dry, mineral scent like cold earth, and the ghost of lanolin from wool long since spun. Elara’s professional curiosity, a brittle shell over her lingering shame, began to crack. Her heartbeat, a dull companion since her arrival, found a new, quicker rhythm.

The room took up the whole top floor, a vast cylinder of stone. Slitted windows, too narrow for anything but a blade of grey daylight, cast faint, sharp lines across the flagstones. And in the centre, taking over the space, was the loom.

It was a beast. A colossal frame of blackened oak, so dark it seemed to drink the scant light. It stood twice her height, a hulking testament to forgotten craftsmanship. The uprights were carved, not with the expected floral motifs of Welsh love spoons, but with dense, interlocking patterns that hurt the eye to follow—spirals that became teeth, knots that looked like barbed wire. The wood wasn’t polished; it was seared, as if by some immense, contained heat.

And on the frame, stretched tight, was the tapestry.

Elara moved closer, her boots whispering on the stone. Her first awe soured into a deep unease. The work was half-finished, the woven part covering the left side, the right just a skeletal grid of warped, unbleached linen threads waiting for their fate. The woven image showed a forest, but no forest she knew. The trees were twisted into black forms, their branches like clutching fingers, their roots like exposed veins. The weave was impossibly fine, the colours muted but unnervingly vivid: deep moss greens that looked black, murky ochres, the dull red of old rust. And in the middle of the scene, a large, human-shaped void. A space where the background weave kept going, but it showed nothing, a blank silhouette waiting to be filled.

But it was the pattern around it that stole her breath. In the borders, in the texture of the bark and leaves, were repeating motifs. They looked runic, but not from any alphabet she recognized. They were sharp, obsessive, woven with a frantic precision. Some looked like barred gates. Others, like simplified, screaming faces. She felt a familiar, academic itch—the need to document, to decipher—but it was drowned by a deeper, primal recoil. This wasn’t decoration. It was an incantation.

“Just thread and dye,” she whispered.
