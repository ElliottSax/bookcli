# Chapter 3: Whispers in the Wool

The rain had settled into a permanent state of being, a fine, whispering mist that blurred the line between the slate-grey sky and the darker grey of the mountains. It seeped into the stone of the old chapel, making the air inside taste of damp wool and cold earth. Elara had been working for a week, and the initial, methodical pace of her conservation had fractured.

It began with her hands.

She would settle before the loom, her tools arranged with clinical precision: the fine-tipped tweezers, the squirrel-hair brushes, the custom-mixed adhesives. She would focus on a damaged section—a frayed warp thread where the green of a hill had unspooled, a weft of black wool chewed by time or something else. She would begin the painstaking process of cleaning, aligning, securing. And then, a strange lassitude would wash over her. Her thoughts, usually a sharp, critical monologue about tensile strength and dye stability, would go quiet. Her hands, competent but never extraordinary, would move with a fluid, unconscious grace. They didn’t seem to be repairing the tapestry so much as *re-membering* it. Threads slipped into place as if drawn by magnets. Knots tied themselves with impossible neatness. A section that should have taken a full day’s concentrated effort would be completed in two hours, leaving her blinking, her neck stiff, her fingers tingling as if with a mild electric current.

It was a conservator’s dream, this preternatural skill. It was also profoundly terrifying.

Then there was the tapestry itself. As she repaired it, it didn’t just regain its former glory; it surpassed it. The colours, once muted by centuries of smoke and light, grew preternaturally vivid. The red of the berries on the thorn bush in the lower left corner became a livid, arterial crimson. The black of the raven’s wing in the upper border deepened into an abyssal void that seemed to swallow the light around it. More unsettling were the subtle shifts. The pattern of leaves on the oak tree, which she had meticulously documented, now seemed to curl in a slightly different direction, suggesting grasping fingers. The expression on the face of the lone female figure—the Bride—was unchanged in direct light, but from the corner of Elara’s eye, the set of the mouth seemed less serene, more… expectant.

She tried to discuss it with Mr. Griffith during his daily visit. He would arrive precisely at eleven, smelling of pipe tobacco and damp wool, and perform a slow circuit of the chapel, his eyes rarely leaving the loom.

“The palette is intensifying beyond normal conservation parameters,” she said one morning, her voice echoing thinly in the vaulted space. She pointed to the repaired hill. “The verdigris and weld compounds couldn’t account for this chroma. It’s as if the dyes are… revitalising.”

Griffith stopped his pacing and looked at her, not at the tapestry. His eyes, the colour of tarnished pewter, held no scholarly curiosity. “You
