Chapter 4: The Keeper of the Pact

The rain had settled into a fine, persistent mist by the time Elara Hughes found the path to Bronwyn’s cottage. It wasn’t on any map from the village shop, and Mrs. Pugh at the B&B had never mentioned it. She’d only heard of it in whispers, the kind that stopped when she entered the pub, leaving behind a silence that felt heavier than noise. She’d caught a fragment of conversation between two old men about “the old woman up in Coed y Ddraig.” The Dragon’s Wood. It felt like a children’s tale, but the dread in her stomach was adult and cold, a leaden weight that had settled there since she first touched the loom.

She left the last cobbled lane of The Village of Llanfair behind, the sound of her boots swallowed by thick moss and decaying leaves. The woods here were ancient, the oaks gnarled and bearded with lichen that felt like damp, crumbling sponge when her shoulder brushed against a trunk. Their branches formed a vaulted ceiling that turned the afternoon into a green-tinged twilight, a submarine gloom where light fell in shattered pieces. The air smelled of damp earth, rotting wood sweet as spoiled fruit, and something else—a faint, astringent scent she couldn’t place. It was the smell of the loom room, only stronger here, threaded through the wet bark and leaf mould like a poison. It coated the back of her throat, metallic and bitter.

Her fingers, tucked into her coat pockets, traced the rough seam of the lining. Every rustle in the undergrowth—the scuttle of a beetle, the fall of a rotten branch—made her muscles tighten. She thought of the ledger’s entries, the names and dates, a chain of obligation that led to her. I didn’t ask for this, she thought, the protest childish even in her own mind. The woods didn’t care. They simply absorbed her footsteps and her fear with the same indifference.

After twenty minutes of climbing, her calves burning, the trees thinned around a small, stony clearing. The cottage hunched against the hillside like an animal seeking shelter, its back pressed to the rock as if for protection. It was older than anything in the village, its stone walls bulging unevenly, the mortar between them gnawed by weather and time. Its roof slate was patched with velvety moss that glowed a lurid, luminous green in the gloom. But it was the doorway that stopped her breath, icing the air in her lungs.

Nailed to the heavy oak door was a cross woven from red-berried rowan twigs, the berries like flecks of fresh blood against the grey wood. They were bound with black thread wound so tightly it bit into the bark. Around the frame, driven deep into the mortar, were iron nails—dozens of them, their heads rusted into flaky, reddish-brown blossoms. More charms hung in the small, leaded windows: bundles of dried herbs that gave off a dusty, medicinal smell, intricate knots of coarse horsehair, circles of woven straw that were too perfect, too symmetrical to be mere folk art. They were not decorations. They were fortifications. A silent, bristling announcement: Keep Out. Or Keep In.

Elara Hughes’s knock was a timid sound against the wood, three soft raps that seemed to die against the surface. For a long moment, there was only the drip of water from the eaves—a slow, irregular plink… plink…—onto a stone already worn smooth by the rhythm, and the thud of her own heart against her ribs. Then a bolt scraped with a sound of protesting metal, and the door opened just wide enough to reveal a slice of a face, pale as parchment and deeply lined, each crease a valley of shadow.

Bronwyn’s eyes were the colour of wet slate, and they held no surprise, only a weary, measured recognition. “You took your time,” she said, her voice a dry rustle like dead leaves skittering on stone. “Come in then. Quickly.” The last word was sharp, a command that brooked no hesitation. Her hand, spotted and sinewy, gestured impatiently.

The inside was a cave of shadows and strange, specific order. A peat fire smouldered in the hearth, filling the single room with a smoky, sweet scent that layered over the underlying smells of dried herbs, old paper, and wool. Every surface was crammed, but not with clutter. There was a terrifying precision to it. More rowan crosses hung above the doorframe inside, their shadows dancing on the ceiling. Horseshoes hung with the open end down from the blackened beams, cold iron against the thatch. On a rough-hewn table, bowls of water held floating holly leaves, their edges sharp and waxy. On the mantel, a line of smooth, black stones, each identical in size, sat like a row of blind eyes. Books were stacked precariously beside jars of roots that twisted like arthritic fingers and feathers from birds she couldn’t name, their colours dulled by dust. In one corner, a simple spinning wheel stood, a half-formed cloud of grey wool on its spindle, waiting. The air was thick, pressurised, heavy with intention. It pressed on Elara Hughes’s eardrums, like the inside of a bell jar just before it seals.

“Sit,” Bronwyn commanded, pointing to a worn settle by the fire. The wood was dark with age and the oil of countless hands. Elara Hughes sat, the settle creaking under her weight, its cushions exhaling a scent of woodsmoke and camphor. She felt exposed, her modern waterproof jacket absurdly bright in the dim room. Bronwyn herself remained standing, a slight, brittle figure wrapped in a shawl that might once have been indigo but was now the colour of a deep bruise, the wool so thin in places it was nearly sheer. She moved to the fire, not to warm herself, but to stir the small iron pot hanging over it with a long, wooden spoon. The contents bubbled thickly, releasing a smell of pine resin and something earthy, like turned soil.

“You’ve been poking at the history,” Bronwyn said without turning. Her back was a curve of bone and thin wool. “Asking about the patterns. Stirring the pot.” She gave the pot in the fire a final, emphatic stir. “Did you think it wouldn’t notice? That they wouldn’t notice?”

“I didn’t know what I was poking at,” Elara Hughes said, her voice sounding too loud, too young. “My great-aunt left me the house. The loom. I found a ledger…”

Bronwyn turned then, her slate eyes pinning Elara Hughes to the settle. “A ledger. Is that what you call it? A book of debts. A roster of the bound.” She set the spoon down on the hearthstone with a deliberate click. “Margred was the last Keeper. A thankless task. She kept the accounts, made sure the work was done. And now she’s gone, and it’s fallen to you. Not because she chose you. Because the blood did. Because the Pattern knows its own.”

Elara Hughes’s hands were cold. She rubbed them together, feeling the callus on her right thumb from the shuttle. “What is the Pattern? What is it for?”

A humourless smile touched Bronwyn’s lips, a crack in dry clay. “For? It’s not for anything. It is. It’s a cage. A beautiful, terrible cage woven over generations. To hold something back. Or to hold something in.” She finally took the chair opposite Elara Hughes, a stiff-backed thing that looked painfully uncomfortable. She sat perfectly upright, her hands folded in her lap. “You’ve felt it. In the threads. A… presence. A hunger that isn’t yours.”

The memory washed over Elara Hughes—the way the wool had seemed to pull through her fingers of its own volition, the dark shape coalescing in the weave, the feeling of being watched from within the itself. She nodded, unable to speak.

“The old stories call it by many names,” Bronwyn continued, her gaze drifting to the fire. “The Entity. The Price. The Guest. It came from the deep places, long before this village had a name. It is old hunger and cold intelligence. And it made a bargain.”

“With who?”

“With us,” Bronwyn said flatly. “Or with the first of us desperate or foolish enough to listen. It offered protection. From plague, from famine, from the wolves in the wood and the raiders from the sea. In return, it asked for a vessel. A home woven from the world’s substance, renewed each generation. A masterpiece that is also a prison.” Her fingers tightened on each other, the knuckles white. “The craft. The beautiful, sacred craft of the weaver. Twisted into this. We don’t create beauty. We spin a jail cell. We weave bars.”

The horror of it unfolded in Elara Hughes’s mind, vast and suffocating. The intricate patterns she’d admired in the old tapestries—they weren’t art. They were architecture for a monster. Tradition wasn’t just a custom; it was a life sentence of forced labour. “And the ledger… the names…”

“Are the weavers,” Bronwyn finished. “One per generation. Chosen by bloodline. They take on the duty. They do the work. And they pay the personal price.” Her eyes met Elara Hughes’s again, and in them was a depth of pity that was worse than anger. “The Entity feeds on more than just the bargain. It feeds on the weaver. On their memories, their dreams, their… vitality. Slowly. Over the years. Until there’s just a husk left, sitting at the loom, following the pattern laid down centuries ago. That is the corruption of your craft, girl. You don’t pour your soul into your work. Your work eats it.”

Elara Hughes’s stomach turned. The astringent smell in the room seemed to coil in her nostrils. “Old Idris…?”

“Is the last weaver before Margred. What’s left of him. He tends the sheep now, the special flock whose wool is used. He doesn’t remember much else. The Pattern took the rest.” Bronwyn leaned forward slightly, the firelight carving hollows in her cheeks. “Margred held on to her mind longer than most. She was strong. She tried to find another way. I believe that’s why she left the house to an outsider. A Hail Mary pass into the darkness.” She snorted softly. “It hasn’t worked. The Pattern is waking. It knows the Keeper is gone and the new weaver is… untrained. Resistant. It’s growing restless. The charms on this door aren’t for show. The old ways are a prison, but breaking them has consequences. The thing in the wood gets hungry.”

A log collapsed in the hearth, sending up a shower of sparks that lit the room in a sudden, violent orange flash. In that instant, the hanging charms cast long, writhing shadows that looked like grasping fingers.

“What happens if the weaving isn’t done?” Elara Hughes asked, her mouth dry.

Bronwyn’s expression closed. “The pact breaks. The protection fails. And the Entity, unbound from its woven cell, is free to take what it’s been owed directly. It won’t be just the weaver it feeds on then. It will be the whole village. The land. Everything.” She said it with the grim certainty of someone who has seen the truth in the bottom of a bowl of water, in the arrangement of stones. “That is the horror of your inheritance, Elara Hughes Hughes. You are bound to a debt you did not create, to a craft turned monstrous, to maintain a prison that also protects. Your choice is not between freedom and obligation. It is between one kind of damnation and another.”

Silence fell, broken only by the crackle of peat and the distant, mournful cry of a bird outside. The weight of it crushed down on Elara Hughes. She saw her future unspool: years at the loom, her hands moving, her self dissolving, weaving a cage for a horror to save a village that whispered about her in fear. A tradition of sacrifice masquerading as survival.

“Is there no way to break it? To destroy it?”

Bronwyn studied her for a long time. “Destroy the Pattern, you destroy the cage. Nothing left to hold it. Others have tried. They’re not in the ledger anymore. They’re in the ground, or worse.” She stood up, moving to a small, dark cupboard. She took out a chipped cup and poured a measure of clear liquid from a stone bottle. It smelled of sharp, fermented herbs. She offered it to Elara Hughes.

Elara Hughes shook her head.

Bronwyn shrugged and took a small sip herself, wincing as it went down. “I am the hedge-witch. The keeper of the old knowledge outside the Pattern. I set the wards. I read the signs. I try to keep the balance from tipping too far. I cannot break the pact. I can only…” She searched for the word. “Interpret. And warn. And when the time comes, prepare the weaver.”

“Prepare me for what?”

“For the next time you sit at the loom,” Bronwyn said, her voice dropping to a near whisper. “It will be waiting for you. It will try to… persuade you. To show you things. To make the work feel necessary, even righteous. It is a seducer as much as a predator. You must learn to hold a part of yourself back, even as your hands work. You must build a wall inside your mind. A pattern of your own.”

She moved to the spinning wheel in the corner. With a practiced touch, she fed a tuft of dirty grey wool onto the spindle and set the wheel turning with a push of her foot. The wheel whirred, a low, rhythmic hum that filled the room. The wool twisted, tightened, became thread. It was a simple, domestic act, but here, in this room, it felt like a ritual. A tiny defiance.

“I can teach you that,” Bronwyn said, her eyes on the growing thread. “Not how to weave the Pattern. That knowledge is in the loom itself; it will guide your hands. I can teach you how to not be eaten by it. How to keep your name, and your memories, a little longer. It’s not freedom. But it’s a few more years of being Elara Hughes Hughes, before you become just ‘the weaver’.”

The offer hung in the smoky air. It was a lifeline thrown from one prisoner to another. Elara Hughes looked around the cottage, at the fortifications against the unseen, at the old woman spinning her thread of resistance. This was what survival looked like here. Not triumph. Not escape. A grim, stubborn holding action in a war that was already lost, fought for the sake of those who didn’t even know the battle existed.

The taste in her mouth was bitter, the same astringent tang from the woods, now understood. It was the taste of the pact. The taste of her future.

“Yes,” she heard herself say, the word leaving her lips before she had fully formed the thought. It wasn’t agreement; it was surrender to the only terms offered. “Teach me.”

Bronwyn nodded, once, a sharp downward motion. “Good. We start now. The first lesson: names have power. Yours is still your own. Never speak it aloud in the loom room. Never think it while you work. Keep it here.” She tapped her own temple. “A secret you keep from yourself. A seed buried deep where it can’t be found and devoured.”

She began to speak then, not of weaving, but of boundaries. Of herbs like vervain and rue that could be tucked into a hem to ground the spirit. Of the practice of visualising a circle of cold iron around one’s thoughts. Of memorising a simple, meaningless rhyme to repeat inwardly, a noise to drown out the whispers that would come. The instructions were practical, earthy, but their purpose was profoundly bleak: how to hollow out a hiding place within your own soul.

As Bronwyn spoke, the green twilight through the leaded windows deepened into proper night. The mist had turned back to rain, a soft patter on the thatch above them. The fire burned lower. Elara Hughes listened, committing the details to memory, building her first, fragile internal barricade. She was learning the rules of her prison, and how to pace her cell. The horror was no longer a mystery; it was a syllabus. The inheritance was not just a house and a loom, but a war for the scraps of her own mind, a war she had already been conscripted to fight, long before she was born.
