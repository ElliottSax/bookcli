# Chapter 5: The Weaving Dream

The dream didn’t start as a nightmare. It started as a memory of touch.

Elara Hughes felt the rough-hewn wood of the upright loom, smooth in places from centuries of handling, the grooves worn by thumbs seeking purchase. She smelled the dense, mineral scent of raw wool, the ghost of peat smoke in the threads, and beneath it, the iron-tang of old blood and the sourness of cold sweat. Her hands—her hands were not her own. They were large, knotted with arthritis and strength, the nails thick and yellowed like old horn, the skin mapped with scars that spoke of blades and brambles. A silvery weal crossed the left knuckle, pulsing with a remembered sting. She held a shuttle of dark, oiled oak, and it felt like an extension of her bones, its weight a familiar promise of strain.

She was looking at the tapestry, but from the wrong side. The world was a chaos of tangled ends, of loose warp threads whispering against each other like dry grass, a labyrinth of potential. This was the view from the loom itself, from within the cage. And she was weaving.

A profound, yawning loneliness filled her, a hollow that stretched back through centuries. It was the loneliness of the hill under the frost, of the standing stone that feels no sun, of a story told so often it has worn away its own meaning. It was coupled with a rage so cold it had become a geological feature, a seam of black ice running through the soul. The rhythm of the treadles under her feet—the left with a faint, protesting squeal, the right with a solid, heart-like thump—was the pounding of a captive heart. The clack of the batten beating the weft into place was the sound of a door sealing shut, over and over again, a percussive finality that vibrated up her forearms and into the hollow of her skull.

*Let me in,* the loneliness whispered, not with sound, but with the pull of the shed, the invitation of the open warp, a vertical mouth begging to be fed. *Let me out,* the rage countered, with the finality of the batten’s blow, compressing the threads into an unyielding wall.

Elara Hughes tried to scream, to drop the shuttle, but the hands worked on, muscles in the forearm bunching and releasing with a will of their own. She was not weaving an image; she was weaving a boundary. Each thread was a bar. Each colour—the dismal brown of turned earth, the grey of old rain, the bruised purple of twilight—was a mood, a piece of the entity’s eternal sentence. The wool felt greasy, alive, as she passed the shuttle through. She felt the prison tightening with every pass, the fabric growing denser, heavier, and yet, perversely, she was also weaving its only conduit to the world. The tapestry was a lock, and she was meticulously setting each tiny, terrible tumbler, her breath coming in ragged sync with the loom’s mechanical sighs.

A final, thunderous beat of the batten. The hands stilled. From the chaos of the back, a face seemed to coalesce in the knotted ends—a suggestion of hollow eyes, a slack mouth formed The dream-fabric dissolved, but the scent of soil and rot clung to the inside of her skull, a phantom residue as tangible as the damp cottage air. In that suspended moment between worlds, the communion held—a silent, The awful understanding passed from the dream’s captive hands to her own waking flesh, a covenant written in fatigue. Then, the real world rushed in, not with light, but with a violent, physical rupture—a final, convulsive shudder that expelled her from one world and into the next.

A gasp sawed from her throat, raw and searing, as she jerked upright in the narrow bed. The dream’s vision was replaced by the close, dark confines of the cottage, the rough blanket tangled around her legs like a snare. For a disoriented moment, the two realities bled together: the phantom sensation of the covenant still prickling on her skin, the taste of the dream still metallic in her mouth. She pressed a hand to her chest, feeling the frantic drum of her heart against her ribs, a stark counter-rhythm to the deep silence of the sleeping house. The details of the room—the faint outline of the shuttered window, the smell of cold ash from the hearth—slowly anchored her, pulling her fully back into the weight of her own body, into the tangible now where the blanket was merely wool and the dark was merely empty. legs. Her hands, still held before her, were not reaching but locked into rigid claws, every tendon standing in a ridge of strain. A deep, borrowed ache throbbed within them, a weary echo of the touch that had never, in truth, occurred.e. She could still feel the phantom weight of the shuttle, the burn of the warp thread against a callous that did not exist on her own soft palm. Dawn was a feeble suggestion at the window, a grey smear leaching the colour from the room, turning the quilt to ash, the washstand to a hulking shadow. The air was chill and still, holding its breath.

She stumbled to the bathroom, her feet numb on the floorboards. Splashing icy water on her face did nothing; the dream-sensation clung like a film. In the mirror, her eyes were hollow, her skin pale as parchment beneath the freckles. She flexed her fingers, watching them tremble, trying to dispel the persistent, alien muscle memory of a grip stronger than her own. The face in the mirror was hers, but the exhaustion in it belonged to someone else, accumulated over decades. *Whose hands?* she thought, the question a dull echo. *Whose loneliness am I wearing?*

A dry, coppery taste filled her mouth—fear, or the ghost of peat-tainted water from the dream. She dressed slowly, the wool of her sweater scratching like a reminder, the texture suddenly foreign and accusing against her skin.

The workshop waited. A low dread pulsed in time with her headache as she crossed the dewy grass, each blade bent under a crystal weight. The village was silent, but not peacefully so; it was the silence of a held breath, of watched windows. She felt the weight of eyes from behind lace curtains, the collective vigilance of a people who knew the signs. She unlocked the door, the iron click absurdly loud in the morning silence, a sound that seemed to ripple outwards over the damp stones. The smell that rushed out was stronger now: damp stone, yes, but underneath, the sweet-rot scent of the wool, and something else, metallic and sharp, like ozone after a lightning strike.

The Bride’s Loom sat in the centre of the room, a silent, waiting beast. Dust motes, stirred by her entrance, drifted through a weak sunbeam and across its frame like insects avoiding a web.

And the tapestry had grown.

Not a little. A full eight-inch band across the middle section was complete. It showed a stretch of the valley under a lowering, stitch-rendered sky, the trees a twisted mass of dark green and black thread. But it was the details that froze the air in her lungs. There, in the corner of the new section, was a tiny, perfect figure. It was rendered in a few strokes of dull brown and grey, but its posture—head down, shoulders hunched—was unmistakably hers, seen from behind, walking the path from the cottage. The stitches that formed her were tighter, denser, than the surrounding landscape, as if the loom had pressed her into the fabric with particular force.

A sound escaped her, not a word, but a thin exhalation of pure disbelief. She took a step closer, her shadow falling across the woven image. As it did, the threads within that small figure seemed to darken, drinking the light. The back of her neck prickled. This wasn’t observation. It was registration.

“It knows your shape now.”

Elara Hughes jumped, her hand flying to her chest. Old Idris stood in the doorway, a silhouette against the bright grey outside. He hadn’t made a sound. He stepped in, his boots scraping grit on the stone floor. He didn’t look at her, his milky eyes fixed on the loom as if he could see every terrible thread.

“What does that mean?” Her voice was rough from sleep and shock.

“Means it’s learning you.” He moved closer, his gnarled hand hovering near the new section, not touching it. His fingers traced the air an inch above the woven Elara Hughes. “The pattern takes what it’s fed. Feeds on what it takes. You dreamt of the weaving last night.”

It wasn’t a question. She nodded, then remembered he couldn’t see it. “Yes. I was… I was the weaver. It was horrible.”

“Aye. That’s the memory in the wood. The last one’s hands. You’re walking in her footprints.” He finally turned his head toward her, his nostrils flaring as if scenting her fear. “The loneliness. The cold rage. You felt it.”

“I felt it.” The admission was a stone in her throat. “It felt… ancient. And personal.”

“It’s both,” Idris said, moving to lean against the cold stone wall. “The thing in the hill is ancient. The woman who bound it… her anger was as fresh as a split lip. You think she wanted this? To be the village’s sacrificial needle?” He barked a short, dry laugh. “She was in love with a man from the next valley. A mason. Had a laugh that could shake apples from a tree. The elders told her she couldn’t leave. The work was coming on her. She wove her fury into every pass. That’s what makes it strong. Not peace. Never peace.”

Elara Hughes wrapped her arms around herself. “That’s monstrous.”

“It’s necessity,” he corrected, his voice like stone grinding. “You think tradition is songs and sweet bread? It’s a chain. Sometimes the links are made of bone. My grandmother, she wove the ’38 binding. Smiled at me with a mouth full of blood from where she’d bitten her tongue through to keep from screaming the thing’s name. She never smiled right again. Her face just… settled wrong afterwards.” He gestured at the loom, a sweeping, dismissive motion. “This is the prettier version. The hidden version. The bride who takes the curse so the family don’t have to see its face. You’re the veil.”

The small, woven Elara Hughes in the tapestry seemed to mock her. A prisoner in a progress report. “I can’t do that. I can’t become that hollow, angry thing. I’m not from here. This isn’t my sacrifice to make.”

Idris was silent for a long moment, his sightless gaze turned toward the window. “The wool chose you. The moment you touched it, your ‘from here’ or ‘not from here’ stopped mattering. You’re in the pattern now. You think you have a choice? Your choice is *how* you weave your anger, your fear. You can let it be a weakness, a tangle that ruins the cloth. Or you can spin it tight, beat it hard, and make it part of the wall. That’s the only freedom this craft offers.”

“You make it sound like a battle.”

“It is,” he said simply. “A quiet, slow one. Fought with thumbs and patience. Every weaver loses a piece of herself on this field. The question is, what piece will you let it take? The soft, scared bit that wants to run? Or the hard, sharp bit that can learn to hold a line?”

He pushed himself off the wall. “You already are becoming it,” Idris said, not unkindly, but with devastating finality. “Every hour you’re near it, it drinks a little of you. Every dream, you drink a little of it. You’re mixing. The work asks for a complete blend. That’s the inheritance. You don’t get the skill without the stain. The craft *is* the corruption here. The beautiful, terrible, necessary corruption.”

He turned to leave, then paused, his hand on the doorframe. “Margred will be up later. She’ll bring you the yarn for the next section. The black, from the peat-dyed fleece. For the crow’s wing. It’s a strong thread. It’ll fight you. Let it. The fight is part of the binding. The resistance is what sets the twist.”

After he left, the silence in the workshop thickened, became a tangible thing with weight and temperature. Elara Hughes stood, caught between the loom and the door, the dream still coiled in her muscles like a dormant vine. She looked at her own hands, soft and unscarred, the hands of a restorer, a preserver of beauty. Then she looked at the hands of the figure in the tapestry, crude stubs of thread. They were pointed toward the centre of the valley, where the next, un-woven section gaped like a waiting mouth—a void that demanded filling.

The dread wasn’t a pulse anymore. It was a constant hum, the sound of the warp under impossible tension. She walked to the bench, her legs moving without her conscious command. She sat. The seat was worn smooth, shaped by generations of weary bodies. She reached out, her fingers a hair’s breadth from the shuttle that lay in the race. She didn’t pick it up. Not yet.

*What piece of me?* she thought, Idris’s question echoing. The scared bit wanted to flee, to pack her car and drive until the taste of peat was gone from her tongue. But beneath that, another feeling stirred, sluggish and dark. It was the same cold ember she’d felt in the dream. It was anger. Anger at being chosen, at being trapped, at the serene, complicit faces of the village elders who had handed her this poisoned chalice. It was a clean, sharp feeling amidst the fog of fear.

She let her fingertips brush the oak of the shuttle. It was warm, as if recently held.

Perhaps that was the piece. Not the soft love for beauty she’d brought with her, but the hard, unyielding anger at its perversion. She could feel the ghost of the last weaver’s rage in the wood, a sister to her own. It was a dark thread, but a strong one.

The woven Elara Hughes in the tapestry stared out, a tiny, trapped sentinel. The un-woven void waited. The workshop held its breath. She was not just weaving a tapestry. She was weaving herself into a tomb of tradition, one terrible, beautiful thread at a time. The shuttle, when she would next pick it up, would feel like her own bone. And part of her, she knew with a sick, thrilling certainty, was already eager for the weight of it, for the clarity of the battle, for the chance to beat her own sharp, defiant thread into the ancient, hungry wall.
