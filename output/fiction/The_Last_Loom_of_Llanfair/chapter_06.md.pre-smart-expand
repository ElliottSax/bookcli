Chapter 6: A History of Blood

The silence in the cottage after Bronwyn’s departure wasn't empty. It was a thick, listening quiet, as if the very walls had absorbed her whispered terror and now held it, suspended. Elara sat at the rough-hewn table for a long time, her fingers tracing the whorls in the wood grain. Her academic mind, that neat filing cabinet of historical cause and effect, had been shattered. Now there was only a raw, animal understanding. The loom wasn't just a relic; it was an altar. The tapestry wasn't just art; it was a contract. And she, Elara Pembrooke, was the ink with which it would be signed.

Bronwyn’s final, choked words echoed: ‘The woods behind the old Davies farm. Where the stream forks. You’ll see.’ It felt less like an invitation and more like a condemnation. Elara knew she was walking into a trap, maybe one set by the old woman herself under duress. But the alternative—sitting, weaving, waiting for the final thread to be placed—was a slower, more exquisite trap. She had to see. She needed proof, not of folklore, but of fact. Blood and stone.

She waited until the deep of night, when the village was a cluster of sleeping shadows. The moon was a paring of bone behind scudding clouds. Dressed in dark jeans and a navy jumper, she slipped from the cottage, the key turning with a click that sounded like a gunshot in the hush. The lane was a river of ink. She kept to the verges, her senses straining. Every rustle in the hedgerow was a pursuing footstep, every sigh of wind the village drawing a collective breath. The Davies farm was a slumped silhouette on the western edge of Llanfair. She passed it, the smell of dung and damp hay thick in the air, and found the stile leading to the copse beyond.

These woods were different. Not the picturesque stands of birch and oak that ringed the village green, but a dense, ancient tangle of yew and thorn. The air grew colder, tasting of damp earth and something else—a metallic tang, like old coins on the tongue. She used the torch on her phone, its beam a frail, blasphemous thing against the primordial dark. The ground sloped downwards, and the sound of water grew from a murmur to a chatter. She found the fork in the stream, two silver veins splitting around a mossy hummock.

And there, in a small clearing the moon suddenly deigned to illuminate, she saw it.

It was a slab of grey stone, maybe six feet long and three wide, half-sunk into the earth as if it had grown there. It sat precisely between the two branches of the stream, a dark island. Moss clothed its sides in velvet green, but its surface had been scoured clean by time and weather, and something else. Elara approached, her breath pluming. The beam of her phone trembled over the stone.

The stains weren't uniform. They were a map of violence, seeped deep into the stone’s pores. At the centre, a large, dark patch, almost black, bloomed like a rotten flower. From it, rivulets of darker hue traced paths towards the edges.
