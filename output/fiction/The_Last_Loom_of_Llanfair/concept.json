  "subgenre": "folk horror",
  "premise": "A disgraced textile conservator accepts a lucrative job to restore a centuries-old 'Bride's Loom' from a remote Welsh village, only to learn its intricate patterns are not decorative but a prison for an ancient, jealous entity. Each thread she repairs grants the spirit more power to weave itself into our world, and the final tapestry she is compelled to complete will name her as its next eternal bride. The villagers, who have secretly maintained the curse for generations, see her not as a savior, but as the perfect sacrificial offering to keep their own families safe.",
  "protagonist": "Elara Vance, a brilliant but ethically-compromised conservator desperate for redemption and a fresh start.",
  "conflict": "Elara must unravel the physical and supernatural tapestry of the loom's curse before she completes the restoration, fighting against both the manipulating entity and the insular village that views her death as necessary folklore.",
  "setting": "Present-day, the isolated fictional village of Llanfair-y-Bryn in the misty hills of Wales.",
  "tone": "Atmospheric, slow-burn dread and mounting paranoia, blending academic intrigue with primal folk terror and a pervasive sense of inescapable tradition."
