Chapter 7: Symbiosis

The hunger was not in her stomach. It was in her hands.

It began as a low hum in the marrow of her knuckles, a vibration that travelled up her tendons and settled as a dull ache in the meat of her palms. If she ignored it, the hum became a throb. The throb became a sharp, staccato pain that shot up her forearms and drilled into her temples. For two days, Elara had tried to resist. She had barricaded the door of the weaver’s cottage with a heavy oak dresser, had sat in the farthest corner, knees drawn to her chest, reciting her doctoral thesis on pre-Roman textile patterns in a desperate, whispered mantra. The logic of academia was her last fortress.

But the entity didn't attack the fortress. It just poisoned the well.

The migraine on the second afternoon was a white-hot spike driven through her right eye. The world swam in a nauseating blur. When she stumbled to the small, cracked washbasin to splash water on her face, the water in the bowl turned pink. A single, perfect crimson droplet fell from her nostril, rippling the surface, before another followed. The nosebleed was brisk and clinical, a quiet, physical verdict. Her body was no longer entirely her own. It was a contested territory, and the ancient thing in the loom was enforcing a brutal treaty.

With the resignation of a prisoner walking to a cell she already occupied, Elara pushed the dresser aside. The scrape of wood on stone was a defeat. The main room of the cottage was cold, the fire Bronwyn had lit that morning now grey ash. But the loom seemed to generate its own warmth, a subtle, fungal heat that radiated from the dark, oil-rubbed wood and the partially woven tapestry upon it. The work she had left—a chaotic, instinctual section of stormy sky and gnarled roots—was now different. The threads had… settled. The chaos had resolved into a clear, grim story.

She approached, her breath pluming in the chill. The tapestry no longer showed just patterns. It told a story.

On the left, a grove of enormous, heart-shaped leaves, woven with such vivid green silk it seemed to pulse. In the centre of the grove stood a woman. She was not rendered in human form, but as a confluence of natural elements: hair of cascading willow fronds, eyes like deep pools of dark water, a dress that was the forest floor itself, blooming with embroidered fungi and tiny, thread-born flowers. This was the entity. Not a monster, but a presence. A genius loci. The next panel showed betrayal. Men in rough, Iron Age tunics, their faces stern and fearful, were driving iron rods—woven with lurid, metallic thread—into the ground around her. The woman’s form was contorted, threads of earthy brown and vibrant green snagged and trapped by the grey lines of iron. The Binding.

Elara’s fingers trembled as she traced the air above the weaving. The next sequence was a procession. A line of women, each dressed in a simple, dark bridal shift, their faces pale ovals of undyed li
