Chapter 6: A History of Blood

The silence in the cottage after Bronwyn’s departure wasn't empty. It was a thick, listening quiet, as if the very walls had absorbed her whispered terror and now held it, suspended. The lingering scent of the old woman—dried lavender, wool steeped in woodsmoke, and beneath it, the sharp, sour note of fear-sweat—coiled in the still air. Elara Hughes sat at the rough-hewn table for a long time, her fingers tracing the whorls in the wood grain, feeling the ridges of old knife marks and the ghostly smoothness of generations of palms. Her academic mind, that neat filing cabinet of historical cause and effect, had been shattered. Now there was only a raw, animal understanding, a cold, heavy stone sitting where her stomach should be. The loom wasn't just a relic; it was an altar. The wasn't just art; it was a contract. And she, Elara Hughes, was the ink with which it would be signed.
Bronwyn’s final, choked words echoed: ‘The woods behind the old Davies farm. Where the stream forks. You’ll see.’ It less like an invitation and more like a condemnation, a sentence passed in a whisper. Elara Hughes knew she was walking into a trap, maybe one set by the old woman herself under duress. But the alternative—sitting, weaving, waiting for the final thread to be placed, feeling the Pattern’s attention settle on her like a physical weight—was a slower, more exquisite trap. She had to see. She needed proof, not of folklore, but of fact. Blood and stone. Something she could point to, something that would scream this is real louder than the rustling in the walls or the pressure behind her eyes.
She moved through the cottage like a ghost, her own movements unfamiliar. When she poured water, the glug from the pitcher was obscenely loud. She waited until the deep of night, when the village was a cluster of sleeping shadows and the only light was the sickly yellow spill from a single streetlamp down the lane. The moon was a paring of bone behind scudding clouds that moved with a ragged, hurried pace. Dressed in dark jeans and a navy jumper, the wool scratchy against her wrists, she slipped from the cottage. The key turned in the lock with a click that sounded like a gunshot in the hush, the metallic scrape vibrating up her arm.
The lane was a river of ink between darker banks of hedge. She kept to the soft, damp verge, her boots sinking slightly into the mud with each step, a soft shuck-shuck sound that appeared to announce her. Her senses strained until they ached. Every rustle in the hedgerow was a pursuing footstep—the scuttle of a vole became a stealthy creep, the settling of a branch a held breath released. Every sigh of wind through the dry beech leaves was the village drawing a collective, watching breath. The cold air smelled of turned earth, rotting leaves, and from somewhere, the distant, greasy smell of a banked peat fire.
The Davies farm was a slumped silhouette on the western edge of The Village of Llanfair, its whitewash glowing faintly in the gloom. She passed it, the smell of dung and damp hay thickening the air, a familiar farmyard scent turned cloying and oppressive. A single sheep coughed in the darkness, a hollow, human sound. She found the stile leading to the copse beyond, its wooden bar worn smooth and slippery with dew under her gripping hands.
These woods were different. Not the picturesque stands of birch and oak that ringed the village green, but a dense, ancient tangle of yew and thorn. The path, barely visible, was a tunnel through clutching branches. The air grew colder, leaching the warmth from her face and hands, tasting of damp earth and something else—a metallic tang, like old coins on the tongue, or the smell of a struck match. She used the torch on her phone, its beam a frail, blasphemous thing against the primordial dark, turning the world into a stark theatre of black and white, making the shadows behind every trunk jump and twist. Twigs snapped underfoot with reports like breaking bones. The ground sloped downwards, soft and spongy with centuries of fallen needles, and the sound of water grew from a murmur to a chatter, then to a frantic, arguing babble as the stream split. She found the fork, two silver-black veins splitting around a mossy hummock of rock that looked like a hunched shoulder.
And there, in a small clearing the moon deigned to illuminate through a rent in the clouds, she saw it.
It was a slab of grey stone, maybe six feet long and three wide, half-sunk into the earth as if it had grown there, or been vomited up from some deep, cold place. It sat precisely between the two branches of the stream, a dark island, the water chuckling darkly around its base. Moss clothed its sides in velvet green, but its surface had been scoured clean by time and weather, and something else. Elara Hughes approached, each step deliberate, the wet grass soaking her ankles. Her breath plumed in the icy air, the only sign of life in the clearing. The beam of her phone trembled over the stone, a shaking circle of white light.
The stains weren't uniform. They were a map of violence, seeped deep into the stone’s pores, part of its very substance. At the centre, a large, dark patch, almost black, bloomed like a rotten flower, its edges feathering out into the grey. From it, rivulets of darker hue traced paths toward the edges, following minute channels in the rock, as if the stone itself had veins and this was its corrupted heart. The surface wasn’t smooth. As she leaned closer, the light picked out shallow, worn depressions at one end—places for knees, perhaps? And at the other, a deeper, cupped hollow. Her own knees weak. She didn’t want to touch it, but her hand, moving as if detached from her body, reached out. Her fingertips brushed the centre of the dark stain.
The stone was freezing, a cold that bit instantly. But beneath that, she fancied she faint, residual warmth, an impossible memory of heat. A wave of nausea rolled through her, bitter at the back of her throat. This was proof. This was fact. It was one thing to hear a story, another to press your hand against the stone that had drunk the blood. The metallic smell was stronger here, coppery and old. She jerked her hand back, wiping it furiously on her jeans.
“You found it, then.”

The voice came from the trees, dry as the rustle of dead leaves. Elara Hughes spun, her phone beam slicing across the clearing to catch Old Idris. He wasn’t hiding. He stood simply within the tree line, leaning on his thornwood stick, his face a web of shadows in the erratic light. He looked like he’d been waiting for centuries.
Elara Hughes’s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird. “Bronwyn told me.”

“Aye.” He took a step forward, his movement stiff, the stick sinking into the soft earth with a wet sound. “She would. The guilt eats at her. Has for years. But knowing and showing are two different things.” His eyes, reflecting the light like an animal’s, were fixed on the stone. “You touched it.”

It wasn’t a question. Elara Hughes said nothing, her mouth dry.
“You can feel it, can’t you?” he continued, his voice low. “The hunger in it. It’s never full. Stone shouldn’t have a memory, but this one does. It remembers every one.”

“Every what?” Elara Hughes’s own voice was a rasp.
“Every offering.” He moved closer, circling the stone slowly, not looking at her. “This is the first truth, girl. Before the loom, before the, there was this. The old craft. The direct trade. Blood for peace, life for land. Simpler. Messier.” He stopped, gesturing with his stick toward the cupped hollow. “The heart went there. The rest… soaked in. The Pattern learned from this. It refined the process. Made it last longer, spread the cost. But this is where it started. This is the root.”

Elara Hughes forced the words out. “How many?”

Idris let out a breath that was almost a laugh. “Does it matter? A history written in blood isn’t counted in numbers. It’s counted in seasons. In quiet harvests. In winters where the snow didn’t creep under the door.” He finally glanced at her, and his gaze was unbearable, full of a terrible, weary knowledge. “You think you’re special? You think your horror is unique? Every one of us, for generations back before the name ‘Hughes’ even existed here, has stood where you’re standing. We’ve all touched that stone. We’ve all debt.”

“I didn’t create it,” she spat, the anger a sudden, hot flare in her chest.
“No,” he agreed, his tone flattening. “You just inherit it. Like you inherit your father’s nose or your grandmother’s china. The horror of inheritance. You’re bound by what you didn’t make. That’s the second truth. The chain has no beginning you can see, and it’s got you by the throat now, so what does it matter who forged the first link?”

He stepped right up to the slab, placing his own gnarled hand flat on the stained surface, not flinching. “My grandfather told me about his uncle. A good carpenter. Made the pews in the chapel. The Pattern took a fancy to him. Saw his skill. One autumn, the blight hit the orchards. Apples rotted on the branches. The village was facing a lean, sickly winter. So they brought him here.” Idris’s fingers curled against the stone. “He went quietly, they said. Knew his duty. The blight stopped. The next harvest was the sweetest anyone could remember.” He lifted his hand, staring at his palm as if expecting to see a stain. “His craft was in his hands. And they became a vessel for a different kind of work. The corruption of craft. The loom i merely st a prettier version. Your skill, your blood, your life—twisted into a knot that keeps the monster fed and the village safe. Tradition isn’t just stories and songs, girl. It’s a prison. The walls are made of ‘what has always been done,’ and the lock is ‘what will happen if we stop.’”

The wind picked up, moaning through the yew trees, carrying the sound of the arguing streams. Elara Hughes wrapped her arms around herself. “And Margred? What was her crime? Having a daughter who wanted to leave?”

Idris’s face closed. “Margred’s crime was love. A selfish love, they replied. She put one life above the life of the whole. She tried to hide you, to break the chain. The Pattern doesn’t allow for broken chains. It pulls tighter.” He turned away from the stone, facing her fully. “You asked for proof. There it is. Cold stone and old blood. Now you know. The question is, what will you do with the knowing?”

“I could leave,” she whispered, but the words had no force. The cottage, the loom, the —they were hooks in her flesh.
“You could,” Idris said. “You could run tonight. But the debt doesn’t vanish. It transfers. It finds the next in line, or it calls the interest due from everyone. A bad death for Old Bronwyn, maybe. A sickness in a child. A roof that falls in. The Pattern ensures the books are balanced. The collective survival has a brutal cost, and someone always pays. Right now, it’s you.”

The finality in his voice was worse than any threat. It was simple accounting. Elara Hughes looked from his ancient, resigned face to the terrible stone, its stain seeming to pulse in the weak light. The trap wasonlyjust sprung; she’d been born inside it. The silence stretched, filled only by the water and the wind.
“Why show me this?” she asked, exhausted. “Why not just let me weave in ignorance?”

For the first time, a crack appeared in his stoicism. A flicker of something like pain. “Because someone should look at it with fresh eyes,” he murmured, more to himself than to her. “Someone should see the horror for what it is, one more time, before they become part of it. Before the reason becomes habit, and the habit becomes tradition, and the horsimplyjust becomes… the way things are.”

He turn, to melt back into the trees.
“Wait.” The word stopped him. “What happens now?”

Idris didn’t look back. “Now? You go home. You weave. You finish the. You take your place. Or you don’t, and we all face the consequence. The old ways aren’t kept alive by belief, girl. They’re kept alive by necessity. And fear.” His shape blurred into the shadows between the trunks. “The path back is behind the yew with the split trunk. Don’t linger. The stone’s attention is on you now.”

And he was gone. The clearing emptier, colder. The stone seemed larger. Elara Hughes’s phone light wavered, the battery icon flashing a weak yellow warning. She took one last, long look at the slab, imprinting its details—the texture of the stain like spilled ink on blotting paper, the way the moss at its base was a richer, darker green, the precise, cruel geometry of its placement between the waters.
She found the split yew, its wound a black mouth in the pale bark, and stumbled back onto the path. The journey back was a blur of panic and crushing numbness. Every sound was amplified; the rustle of her own jacket was a pursuer at her heels. The farm buildings loomed like tombstones. When she finally reached the cottage lane, the first grey smear of dawn was bleeding into the eastern sky, making the world seem flat and unreal.
She let herself in, the familiar smell of the cottage—beeswax, old paper, dust—now layered with the new, permanent scent of wet wool and dread. She didn’t turn on the lights. She walked straight through to the back room.
The loom stood in the gloom, a complex skeleton. The unfinished upon it was a void of colour and potential. In the half-light, the woven sectionto shift, the patterns suggesting shapes she couldn’t quite make out—a branching tree, a running stream, a standing stone. Her hands, cold and clumsy, rose of their own volition. Her fingers brushed the warp threads. They hummed, a vibration so faint it might have been her imagination, or her own trembling. But she it in the roots of her teeth.
This was her inheritance. Not the cottage, not the china. This machine, this ritual, this bloody, ancient debt. The horror wasn’t in the stone in the woods; that was just the evidence. The horror was here, in this quiet room, in the craft waiting to be corrupted, in the tradition that was her prison cell. The Pattern was in the threads, in the village, in the blood in her veins.
She stood there until the sun properly rose, a thin, cheerless light revealing the dust motes dancing in the air. The decision wasn’t a conscious one. It was a surrender, a folding of the self into the shape demanded. She pulled the stool over. She sat. She reached for the next shuttle, its wood smooth from the grip of hands she would never know. The thread within was a deep, rust red.
Shto weave.
