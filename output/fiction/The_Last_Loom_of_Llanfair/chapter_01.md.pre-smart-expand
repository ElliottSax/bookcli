# Chapter 1: The Offer

The dust in the London museum’s conservation lab had a particular quality. It wasn’t the soft, forgiving dust of attics, but a sharp, particulate grime—a silt of dead skin, eroded stone, and pulverized history. Elara Hughes watched a mote of it spiral through a slant of afternoon light. This was her final act as Senior Textile Conservator. The box on the desk, a cardboard cube of profound emptiness, held the pitiful sum of her professional life: a half-empty mug that read ‘I ♥ Baroque Bobbins’, a bone folder, her personal set of micro-tools. The rest—the solvents, the humidification tents, the peer-reviewed journals—stayed behind. They belonged to the institution, just like her reputation had.

“It’s not personal, Elara,” Charles had said, his voice a study in mortified bureaucracy. He couldn’t meet her eyes, focusing instead on the disastrous before-and-after photographs on his monitor. “The Donor… the public outcry… we need accountability.”

*Accountability.* The word tasted of ash. The 18th-century *Devonshire Hunting Tapestry* had come to her brittle and faded, its silks gnawed by time. The verdant hills were a sickly grey-green, the crimson of the hunters’ coats bled to a watery pink. Her sin had been ambition. She’d tried a new, experimental enzymatic bath, peer-tested and promising gentle revitalization. It worked, magnificently—for forty-eight hours. Then, like a cruel magic trick, the restored colours began to leach away, faster than before, taking fragments of the original weave with them. The scene was left ghostly, patchy, *wounded*. The headline in the arts section said it all: **‘Restoration or Ruination? Museum’s “Miracle Cure” Destroys National Treasure.’**

She was a cautionary tale now. A ghost in the halls she’d walked for twelve years.

Her flat that evening was a silent accusation. The rent was due. The specialized world of textile conservation was a small, gossipy village; news of her disgrace would have already seeped into every curatorial office in the country. She poured a large gin, the ice cracking like tiny bones, and stared at the blank screen of her laptop. Job sites offered nothing. ‘Textile Specialist’ roles demanded flawless records. ‘Museum Assistant’ positions paid less than her student loans demanded.

That’s when the post slithered through her letterbox. As the London sky deepened to a bruised purple, it arrived. Not a bill, not junk. A thick, cream envelope of heavy, watermarked paper. It felt substantial, expensive. The address was handwritten in a precise, spidery copperplate that seemed to belong to another century. The return address simply read: *The Llanfair Historical Trust, Llanfair, Gwynedd.*

Frowning, she slit it open. Inside, on matching paper, the same hand laid out its stark, astonishing terms.

*To Ms. Elara Hughes,*

*The Trustees of the Llanfair Historical Trust extend to you an invitation to undertake a private conservation project of a unique and delicate nature. The*
