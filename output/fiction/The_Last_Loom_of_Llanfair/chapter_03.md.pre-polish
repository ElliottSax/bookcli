Chapter 3: Whispers in the Wool

The rain had settled into a permanent state of being, a fine, whispering mist that blurred the line between the slate-grey sky and the darker grey of the mountains. It wasn't a storm, but a slow, patient leaching of moisture from the world, a sound like static between stations. It seeped into the stone of the old chapel, making the air inside taste of damp wool and cold earth, of moss and something faintly metallic, like a penny held under the tongue. Every surface held a chill that crept through the soles of Elara Hughes’s boots. She had been working for a week, and the initial, methodical pace of her conservation had fractured.

It began with her hands.

She would settle before the loom, the oak bench groaning under her weight. Her tools were arranged with clinical precision on a strip of raw linen: the fine-tipped tweezers, cold against her palm; the squirrel-hair brushes, their handles worn smooth by generations of unknown fingers; the custom-mixed adhesives in small ceramic pots, smelling of strange, sharp resins. She would focus on a damaged section—a frayed warp thread where the green of a hill had unspooled like a loose nerve, a weft of black wool chewed by time or something with finer, more deliberate teeth. She would begin the painstaking process: the breath held, the magnifying lens swung into place, the world narrowing to a single, decaying fibre.

And then, a strange lassitude would wash over her, starting at the base of her skull. It was a heavy, warm feeling, like sinking into a bath after being too long in the cold. Her thoughts, usually a sharp, critical monologue about tensile strength and dye stability, would go quiet, not absent but muffled, as if heard through thick felt. Her hands, competent but never extraordinary, would move with a fluid, unconscious grace. They didn’t seem to be repairing the so much as re-membering it. Threads slipped into place as if drawn by magnets, the ends marrying seamlessly. Knots tied themselves with impossible neatness, tiny, perfect nodes of restoration. A section that should have taken a full day’s concentrated effort would be completed in two hours, leaving her blinking, her neck stiff with a deep ache, her fingers tingling as if with a mild electric current, the ghost sensation of threads still moving between them.

It was a conservator’s dream, this preternatural skill. It was also profoundly terrifying. The first time it happened, she’d jerked back from the loom, knocking over a pot of distilled water. The clear liquid had spread across the flagstones, darkening the grey stone to black, and for a dizzying second, she saw not her own reflection, but a rippling, distorted version of the thorn bush from the . She’d put it down to fatigue. By the third time, she could no longer pretend.

Then there was the itself. As she repaired it, it didn’t just regain its former glory; it surpassed it. The colours, once muted by centuries of smoke and light, grew preternaturally vivid. The red of the berries on the thorn bush in the lower left corner became a livid, arterial crimson that seemed to glisten under the work lamp. The black of the raven’s wing in the upper border deepened into an abyssal void that seemed to swallow the light around it, a pocket of absolute nothingness in the woven field.

More unsettling were the subtle shifts. The pattern of leaves on the great oak tree, which she had meticulously documented in her notebook with precise, measured sketches, now seemed to curl in a slightly different direction, the serrated edges suggesting grasping fingers rather than foliage. The expression on the face of the lone female figure—the Bride—was unchanged in direct light, but from the corner of Elara Hughes’s eye, or in the shifting shadows of a cloud passing outside, the set of the mouth seemed less serene, more… expectant. The lips were not quite parted, but they had lost their sealed neutrality. They held the potential for a word, or a sigh.

One afternoon, repairing a section of sky near the figure, her own breath fogged slightly on the glass of her magnifier. When it cleared, she was certain the Bride’s embroidered eye, a stitch of deep indigo wool, was no longer fixed on the distant standing stone in the scene, but had shifted minutely downward. Toward her.

She tried to discuss it with Mr. Griffith during his daily visit. He would arrive precisely at eleven, the heavy chapel door groaning on its iron hinges. He smelled of pipe tobacco, damp wool, and the faint, sweet-sour scent of turned earth that clung to everything here. He performed a slow circuit of the chapel, his boots scraping on the stone, his eyes rarely leaving the loom. He never touched anything. He simply orbited.

“The palette is intensifying beyond normal conservation parameters,” she said one morning, her voice echoing thinly in the vaulted space, swallowed by the damp. She pointed to the repaired hill with a brush handle, her hand steady but her insides feeling loose. “The verdigris and weld compounds I’ve used couldn’t account for this chroma. It’s chemically improbable. It’s as if the dyes are… revitalising themselves.”

Griffith stopped his pacing. The sound of his footsteps ceased, leaving only the whisper of the rain on the high, narrow windows. He looked at her, not at the . His eyes, the colour of tarnished pewter, held no scholarly curiosity, only a flat, assessing patience. “You are doing precisely what is required, Miss Hughes.” His voice was like gravel shifting. “The work accepts your hand. That is the important thing.”

“Accepts my hand?” Elara Hughes echoed, a cold knot tightening in her stomach. “It’s not a question of acceptance. It’s a question of material science. These threads…” She reached toward the vibrant green hill, then pulled her fingers back, curling them into her palm. “They feel warm sometimes. After I work on them.”

A flicker of something passed over Griffith’s face—not surprise, but recognition. He turned his gaze back to the , his profile sharp against the grey light from a window. “The Pattern holds more than colour. It holds memory. Sunlight on grass. The chill of deep soil. You are not merely applying adhesive to thread. You are restoring a state of being.” He said it as if explaining why a roof leaked, with a mundane certainty that made her skin prickle.

“That’s not conservation,” she said, her professional outrage a thin shield against a rising dread. “That’s… animism. Or psychosis.”

He finally looked at her again, and his expression was almost pitying. “It is tradition, Miss Hughes. The only kind that matters. The kind that keeps the walls standing.” He gestured vaguely upward, not toward the roof, but toward the invisible mountains beyond the stone. “Your predecessor, Mr. Clarke, he understood the theory. The chemistry. But his hands were… reluctant. The work fought him. It does not fight you.”

The word predecessor hung in the damp air. She thought of the neat, unanswered emails, the disconnected phone number. “Where is Mr. Clarke now?”

Griffith’s gaze drifted away, toward the chapel’s small, plain altar. “He completed his contract. He left.” There was a finality in the statement that closed like a door.

After he left, Elara Hughes found she couldn’t return to the loom. The silence in the chapel was no longer empty; it was thick, attentive. She could hear the faint, settling sounds of the stone, the drip of water finding a new path down the far wall. She walked to the north window, where the glass was murky with age and condensation. Rubbing a clear spot with her sleeve, she peered out toward the village.

Through the veil of rain, she saw a figure standing at the edge of the overgrown churchyard. It was Margred. She was not moving, not looking toward the chapel, but standing perfectly still, her shawl a dark blotch against the grey-green of the thorny hedgerow. She seemed to be waiting. Watching the weather, perhaps. Or watching the chapel. A gust of wind pulled at her skirts, but she didn’t shift to steady herself. She was as still as the standing stones on the high moor.

Elara Hughes stepped back from the window, her breath catching. When she looked again a moment later, the spot was empty, leaving only the thrashing hedge and the relentless rain.

That night, in the cramped, low-beamed bedroom of the cottage, sleep refused to come. The wind had risen, moaning in the chimney and rattling the ill-fitting window latch. Every sound was amplified. The creak of a floorboard downstairs became a footfall. The scrabble of a branch against slate became fingernails seeking purchase. She lay rigid, her eyes open, tracing the cracks in the plaster ceiling.

And then, she heard the loom.

It was not a loud sound. It was the soft, rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the beater bar compressing weft, and the whisper-shush of a shuttle passing through the shed. It came from downstairs, clear and unmistakable beneath the wind.

Her blood turned to ice. She was alone in the cottage. The loom was in the chapel.

She sat up, the wool blankets scratching her skin. The sound continued, a steady, patient, mechanical heartbeat. Thump-thump-thump. Shush. Thump-thump-thump.

Logic fought with raw sensation. A trick of the wind. Water in the pipes. But she knew the sound of a loom the way a sailor knows the sound of rigging. This was no trick.

She swung her legs out of bed, the floorboards biting cold against her feet. She didn’t turn on the light. She crept to her bedroom door, opened it a crack. The narrow staircase was a pit of blackness. The sound was slightly louder here, but it wasn’t coming from the cottage’s downstairs. It was directionless, woven into the fabric of the night itself, seeming to emanate from the walls, from the air.

She stood there, shivering, for what felt like an hour, until the sound gradually faded, not into silence, but into the pattern of the wind, as if it had been part of it all along. She returned to bed, but did not sleep. She stared at the dark, thinking of Griffith’s words: The work accepts your hand.

At dawn, hollow-eyed, she went to the chapel earlier than usual. The key turned stiffly in the lock. The interior was frigid, the air stale. She went straight to the loom, her heart a frantic bird in her chest.

Nothing was out of place. Her tools lay as she had left them. The sat, immense and silent. But when she leaned close, her nose inches from the section she had repaired yesterday—the vibrant, impossible green hill—she inhaled. Beneath the smells of old wool, adhesive, and stone, she caught a new scent. It was the green, crushed smell of a meadow after rain. A smell that had no business in a sealed, centuries-old chapel.

She worked that day in a state of hyper-alert exhaustion. Every movement of her own hands felt watched. The fluid grace returned in the afternoon, as she worked on the black wool of the raven’s other wing. Her consciousness seemed to retreat to a small, observant room at the back of her skull. From there, she watched her hands move, independent and sure, weaving in new threads of black that were not quite black—they held a blue sheen like a starling’s feather, a colour she knew she had not mixed, had never seen in her supplies. As her hands worked, a low hum began in her ears, a vibration more than a sound, resonating in her jawbone. It was not unpleasant. It felt like the purr of a vast, stone cat.

When the episode passed, she was clammy with sweat. The raven’s wing was complete. It was magnificent. It was horrifying. The bird now seemed poised not for flight, but for a downward plunge, its new eye (had it always had two?) a tiny bead of polished jet that caught the light and held it, glinting.

She fled the chapel, not bothering to cover the loom. She needed air that didn’t taste of history.

She walked blindly, past her cottage, down the single muddy track toward the village. The rain had softened to a drizzle. The mountains were hidden in cloud, their presence only a heavier grey in the sky. She passed the first stone cottages, smoke struggling from their chimneys. A child’s face appeared at a window, pale and round, and then ducked away.

She found herself outside the small, dim shop. The bell jangled a harsh, tinny sound as she entered. The air inside was warm and close, smelling of paraffin, cured meat, and dust. Old Idris was behind the counter, wrapping a piece of hard cheese in waxed paper for a woman Elara Hughes didn’t recognise. The woman took her parcel, glanced at Elara Hughes with swift, appraising eyes, and left without a word.

Idris wiped his hands on his apron. “Miss Hughes. You’re far from your post.” His voice was neutral, but his eyes, deep-set in a web of wrinkles, were keen.

“I needed… supplies,” she said lamely, her mind blank. She gestured vaguely at the shelves. “Tea.”

He nodded slowly, not moving to fetch anything. “The work is going well, then?”

The question felt like a trap. “It’s… complex. The is unlike anything I’ve encountered.”

“Aye,” he said, the single word heavy. “It would be.”

She gathered her courage, leaning slightly against the counter, feeling the rough, worn wood under her fingertips. “Mr. Griffith says it holds memory. That I’m restoring a state of being.”

Idris was silent for a long moment. He looked past her, out the smeared window to the empty street. “Griffith talks of the Pattern like it’s a ledger. All debits and credits.” He shifted his gaze back to her. His voice dropped, not to a whisper, but to a low, gravelly register meant for her alone. “My grandmother, she worked the wool for the last full cleaning, near eighty year ago. She said the black wasn’t dyed with oak gall or iron. She said they’d set the vat under a moonless sky, and the wool drank the darkness. She said the red… the red had to be stirred with a rowan stick, and the stirrer couldn’t look down into the pot.” He paused, letting the image settle in the dusty air. “You don’t just fix a thing like that, girl. You treat with it. And it treats with you.”

Elara Hughes’s mouth was dry. “Treats for what?”

Idris’s face closed, the shutters coming down. He turned and took a box of tea from a shelf, placing it on the counter with a soft thud. “That’ll be two pound sixty.” The transaction was a wall. When she handed him the money, his fingers, dry and cold as twigs, brushed hers. He didn’t let go immediately. “You hear the loom at night?”

She froze. The admission felt dangerous. She gave the slightest nod.

A shadow of something like sorrow crossed his face. “Aye. It’s making itself ready. And so must you.” He released her hand. “Good day, Miss Hughes.”

She stumbled back out into the drizzle, the box of tea clutched to her chest like a shield. The walk back to the chapel was a blur of grey stone and green, dripping bracken. The sense of being in a story with pre-written pages was overwhelming. She was not an expert here. She was a material, a thread being selected for a purpose she didn’t comprehend.

She didn’t enter the chapel. She went to her cottage, built a meagre fire, and sat before it, staring at the weak, orange flames. Her hands, resting on her knees, looked alien to her. They were the instruments of this unsettling grace. They had touched the Pattern and the Pattern had touched them back. She thought of the warm threads, the scent of meadow, the night-time rhythm of a phantom loom. You are not merely applying adhesive to thread.

As dusk fell, painting the room in shades of charcoal and blue, she made a decision. She would document it. Not in her official log for Griffith, but in her private notebook. She would record every anomaly, every shift, every moment of lost time. It was the only way to hold onto a reality that was fraying at the edges. She fetched the book, a simple black moleskine, and a pen. By the fire’s dying light, she began to write, her script hurried and sharp.

Day Eight. Tactile hallucination? Section 7A (green hill) emits thermal anomaly, approx 2-3 degrees above ambient. Confirmed with back of hand. Olfactory hallucination concurrent – phantosmia of cut grass/hay. Note: Idris, village shopkeeper, implies ritual dye processes beyond documented history. Mentions grandmother ‘treating’ with the material. Subject: ‘The Pattern’. He heard the loom sound at night. I am not the only one.

She paused, chewing on the end of the pen. The fire popped, sending up a spray of sparks. She added, the pen digging into the paper:

My hands are not my own when I work. They are skilled in ways I have never learned. It feels like being borrowed.

She closed the book sharply, as if to trap the words inside. The final line felt like a confession, and confessions, once made, have a power of their own. Outside, the wind picked up again, and in its moan, she feared she could hear, just on the threshold of perception, the distant, patient thump-thump-thump of the beater, beating the world into a shape it was meant to hold.
