Chapter 8: The Run

The air in the weaving room had become a second skin, thick with the smell of lanolin, old dust, and something else—a sweet, vegetal decay that seemed to come from the tapestry itself. Elara’s fingers, moving on their own, passed the shuttle through the warp. Clack of the batten. Swish of the thread. The rhythm was inside her skull now, a kind of parasitic heartbeat. The figure in the weaving—the Bride—was no longer a distant, stylized symbol. Under Elara’s hands, it had gained dimension. There was the hint of a face, turned slightly, as if listening. The folds of the gown held pockets of deep blackness that seemed to swallow the light from the single, guttering oil lamp.

Bronwyn’s entrance was so quiet it took a moment to sink in. She stood in the doorway, a silhouette against the deep blue twilight of the hall. For days, the old woman had been a ghost, bringing meals, removing chamber pots, her eyes always downcast, her silence heavier than any threat. But now, she held Elara’s gaze. Her wrinkled face was the colour and texture of old parchment, but her eyes were fiercely, terrifyingly alive.

“They’re at the long table,” Bronwyn whispered, her voice a dry rustle. “The Choosing Feast. They’ll be there for hours, drinking the strong cider. They’ll be loud. Then they’ll be slow.”

Elara’s hands froze. The shuttle slipped from her numb fingers, rolling across the half-formed web. “What are you saying?”

“I’m saying the mountains are dark now. And I’m saying I left the postern gate in the old wall unbarred.” Bronwyn stepped into the room, her movements quick and birdlike. From the deep pockets of her apron she pulled a small, greasy cloth bundle. “Cheese. Oatcake. It isn’t much. Your map is in your satchel, by your bed. Take it.”

Hope, so long buried it had turned to stone, cracked open in Elara’s chest. It was a painful, dazzling feeling. “Why? After all this… why would you help me?”

Bronwyn’s gaze flickered to the tapestry, to the emerging Bride, and a spasm of old grief twisted her features. “My daughter had your colour hair. A flame in the wind, she was. The loom took her voice first. Then her dreams. Then it asked for the rest.” She looked back at Elara, her eyes wells of pure, undiluted hatred—not for Elara, but for the room, the loom, the very stones of the house. “It isn’t a sacrifice. It’s a consumption. I won’t grease its throat again. Now, go. While there’s still a ‘you’ left to go.”

The plan was absurdly simple, which was its only strength. Bronwyn would create a diversion—a dropped lantern in the hayloft, she muttered. The old men would shuffle to investigate, the younger ones too deep in their cups to move quickly. Elara was to slip out the back of the house, through the kitchen garden, find the crumbled section of the village’s ancient perimeter wall, and run. Not toward the road—that would be watched—but up, into the teeth of the Black Mountains, using her o
