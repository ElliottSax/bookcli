Chapter 11: The Unraveling

The chant was a living thing. It rose from the throats of the villagers encircling the stone loom, a low, guttural drone that seemed less a product of human lungs than a vibration drawn up from the deep earth itself. It thrummed through the flagstones, up through the soles of Elara’s bare feet—a cold, insistent pulse that matched the frantic beat of her heart. The air in the old tithe barn was thick with the smell of damp wool, peat smoke, and the iron-tang of her own fear. Before her, the Loom of Llanfair stood complete, a monolith of dark, oil-rubbed oak and taut, ghost-pale warp threads. And upon it, the Tapestry.

Her Tapestry.

It glowed with a sickly internal light, a phosphorescence that had nothing to do with the guttering torches. The complex, beautiful, terrible pattern she had woven under duress was no longer just wool and dye. It was a membrane, a spiritual skin stretched taut over a screaming void. And it was breathing. Subtly, the hills and woven stars within it swelled and contracted, as if the landscape it depicted had its own horrid respiration.

Elara stood at the loom-post, her hands resting on the finished web. The villagers’ eyes were upon her, but they did not see her. They saw the Weaver, the vessel, the final thread in their own ancient, desperate pattern. Mrs. Pugh’s face was a mask of ecstatic devotion, tears cutting clean tracks through the wrinkles on her cheeks. Old Idris’s mouth moved soundlessly, his gnarled fingers clutching a moth-eaten scrap of wool—a relic of a previous weaving. Bronwyn was not there. The memory of her friend’s face, pale and furious as the men dragged her back into the mist-shrouded woods hours before, was a shard of ice in Elara’s chest.

But the cold was nothing compared to the presence now flooding into her.

It started as a pressure behind her eyes, a sense of another consciousness pressing against the fragile bone of her skull. Then came the whispers, not in her ears, but directly into the fabric of her thoughts. They were not words, but impressions: the crushing weight of centuries, the dry, desperate thirst of barren soil, the possessive, covetous love of a thing that had never known warmth.

My home, the entity sighed into her. My beautiful, final home. You have built it so well.

Elara’s jaw ached from clenching. She had to let it in. That was the brutal, elegant horror of the ritual. The tapestry was not a cage; it was a conduit, a meticulously crafted welcome mat. To destroy it from the outside was impossible—the village’s belief, the accumulated power of generations, protected it. But from within the pattern itself, a flaw could be catastrophic.

Her sabotage wasn’t a slash or a burned hole. It was a whisper of wrongness woven into the song. In the lower left quadrant, where the pattern called for the “Knot of Sure Foundation,” she had woven the “Moth’s Promise.” A tiny, almost indistinguishable deviation: a thread of undyed, weak-spun yarn.
