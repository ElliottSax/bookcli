Chapter 4: The Keeper of the Pact

The rain had settled into a fine, persistent mist by the time Elara found the path to Bronwyn’s cottage. It wasn’t on any map from the village shop, and Mrs. Pugh at the B&B had never mentioned it. She’d only heard of it in whispers, the kind that stopped when she entered the pub. She’d caught a fragment of conversation between two old men about “the old woman up in Coed y Ddraig.” The Dragon’s Wood. It felt like a children’s tale, but the dread in her stomach was adult and cold.

She left the last cobbled lane of Llanfair behind, the sound of her boots swallowed by thick moss and decaying leaves. The woods here were ancient, the oaks gnarled and bearded with lichen, their branches forming a vaulted ceiling that turned the afternoon into a green-tinged twilight. The air smelled of damp earth, rotting wood, and something else—a faint, astringent scent she couldn’t place. It was the smell of the loom room, only stronger.

After twenty minutes of climbing, the trees thinned around a small, stony clearing. The cottage hunched against the hillside like an animal seeking shelter. It was older than anything in the village, its stone walls bulging, its roof slate patched with velvety moss. But it was the doorway that stopped her breath.

Nailed to the heavy oak door was a cross woven from red-berried rowan twigs, bound with black thread. Around the frame, driven deep into the mortar, were iron nails—dozens of them, their heads rusted into bloody blossoms. More charms hung in the small, leaded windows: bundles of dried herbs, intricate knots of horsehair, circles of woven straw. They were not decorations. They were fortifications.

Elara’s knock was a timid sound against the wood. For a long moment, there was only the drip of water from the eaves and the thud of her own heart. Then a bolt scraped, and the door opened just wide enough to reveal a slice of a face, pale as parchment and deeply lined.

Bronwyn’s eyes were the colour of slate, and they held no surprise. “You took your time,” she said, her voice a dry rustle. “Come in then. Quickly.”

The inside was a cave of shadows and strange, specific order. A peat fire smouldered in the hearth, filling the single room with a smoky, sweet scent. Every surface was crammed, but not with clutter. There were more rowan crosses, horseshoes hung with the open end down, bowls of water with floating holly leaves, and on the mantel, a line of smooth, black stones. Books were stacked precariously beside jars of roots and feathers. In one corner, a simple spinning wheel stood, a half-formed cloud of grey wool on its spindle. The air was thick, pressurised, like the inside of a bell jar.

“Sit,” Bronwyn commanded, pointing to a worn settle by the fire. She herself remained standing, a slight, brittle figure wrapped in a shawl that might once have been indigo but was now the colour of a deep bruise. “You’ve been poking at the history. Asking about the patterns. Stirring the pot.”
