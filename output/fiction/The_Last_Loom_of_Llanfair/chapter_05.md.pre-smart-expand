Chapter 5: The Weaving Dream

The dream didn’t start as a nightmare. It started as a memory of touch.

Elara felt the rough-hewn wood of the uprights, smooth in places from centuries of handling. She smelled the dense, mineral scent of raw wool, the ghost of peat smoke in the threads. Her hands—her hands were not her own. They were large, knotted with arthritis and strength, the nails thick and yellowed, the skin mapped with scars that spoke of blades and brambles. She held a shuttle, and it felt like an extension of her bones.

She was looking at the tapestry, but from the wrong side. The world was a chaos of tangled ends, of loose warp threads, a labyrinth of potential. This was the view from the loom itself, from within the cage. And she was weaving.

A profound, yawning loneliness filled her, a hollow that stretched back through centuries. It was the loneliness of the hill under the frost, of the standing stone that feels no sun, of a story told so often it has worn away its own meaning. It was coupled with a rage so cold it had become a geological feature, a seam of black ice running through the soul. The rhythm of the treadles was the pounding of a captive heart. The clack of the batten beating the weft into place was the sound of a door sealing shut, over and over again.

Let me in, the loneliness whispered, not with sound, but with the pull of the shed, the invitation of the open warp. Let me out, the rage countered, with the finality of the batten’s blow.

Elara tried to scream, to drop the shuttle, but the hands worked on. She was not weaving an image; she was weaving a boundary. Each thread was a bar. Each colour—the dismal brown of turned earth, the grey of old rain, the bruised purple of twilight—was a mood, a piece of the entity’s eternal sentence. She felt the prison tightening with every pass, and yet, perversely, she was also weaving its only conduit to the world. The tapestry was a lock, and she was meticulously setting each tiny, terrible tumbler.

She woke with a gasp, sitting bolt upright in the narrow bed of the cottage. Her hands were clenched into claws, aching. She could still feel the phantom weight of the shuttle, the burn of the warp thread against a callous that did not exist on her own soft palm. Dawn was a feeble suggestion at the window, leaching the colour from the room. She stumbled to the bathroom, splashing icy water on her face. In the mirror, her eyes were hollow, her skin pale as parchment. She flexed her fingers, trying to dispel the persistent, alien muscle memory.

The workshop waited. A low dread pulsed in time with her headache as she approached the old stone building. She unlocked the door, the click absurdly loud in the morning silence. The Bride’s Loom sat in the centre of the room, a silent, waiting beast.

And the tapestry had grown.

Not a little. A full eight-inch band across the middle section was complete. It showed a stretch of the valley under a lowering, stitch-rendered sky, the trees
