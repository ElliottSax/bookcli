      ],
      "ending_hook": "On a train leaving Wales, Elara looks at her reflection. Sometimes, she sees the other face. She opens her portfolio; inside is a single, perfect thread of impossibly dark wool. She knows two things: she understands textiles now on a level no one else does, and somewhere, in the back of her mind, a phantom loom continues to weave. The work is never truly finished."
