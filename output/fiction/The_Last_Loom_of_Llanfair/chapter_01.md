Chapter 1: The Offer

Dust in the London Museum Conservation Lab possessed a particular quality. Not the soft, forgiving dust of attics, but a sharp, particulate grime—a silt of dead skin, eroded stone, and pulverized history that caught in the throat and left a mineral tang on the tongue. A mote of it spiraled through a slant of afternoon light, a tiny, chaotic planet in the sterile sunbeam. The light cut across her worktable, illuminating the ghost of a stain where a bottle of distilled water had once sat for seven years.
This was her final act as Senior Textile Conservator.
On the desk sat a cardboard cube of profound emptiness, smelling faintly of old apples and defeat. Inside lay the pitiful sum of her professional life: a half-empty mug that read ‘I ♥ Baroque Bobbins’—a gift from an intern, its rim chipped from the day the Donor first toured the lab—a bone folder worn smooth by the groove of her own thumb, her personal set of micro-tools laid in their velvet-lined case like surgical instruments for a doll. The rest—the solvents with their sharp, clarifying stench, the humidification tents that breathed like pale lungs, the peer-reviewed journals screaming with her own optimistic marginalia—stayed behind. They belonged to the institution, just like her reputation had.
From the corridor came the familiar, hollow clack of a janitor’s cart and the low murmur of two curators from Asian Ceramics discussing a symposium. Their voices passed the sealed door without pausing. She was already an absence.
“It’s not personal, Elara,” Charles had said three hours earlier, his voice a study in mortified bureaucracy. He’d positioned himself behind his vast, empty desk, a fortress of pale oak, and focused on the disastrous before-and-after photographs glowing on his monitor. The digital slider showed the Devonshire Tapestry in its initial state of mournful fade, then in the brief, glorious burst of false vitality she’d given it—the emerald hills shocking in their lushness, the crimson coats blazing as if fresh from the dyer’s vat—and finally, the horrific third state: a leprous, patchy dissolution, threads bared like nerves. He couldn’t meet her eyes. His fingers played a silent tune on a stress ball shaped like a terracotta warrior. “The Donor… the public outcry… we need accountability.”

*Accountability.* The word tasted of ash and the particular, flat bitterness of the institutional coffee she’d drunk for a decade. She’d stood there, the expensive wool-blend of her trousers—bought for confidence—turning clammy at the knees.
The 18th-century Devonshire Tapestry had arrived brittle and faded, its silks gnawed by time into a fragile, whispering web. The verdant hills were a sickly grey-green, the crimson of the hunters’ coats bled to a watery pink reminiscent of old meat. Her sin had been ambition, a desperate, prideful reach for something beautiful. She’d tried a new, experimental enzymatic bath, peer-tested and promising gentle revitalization. In the controlled quiet of the lab, under the cool eye of the magnifier lamp, it had seemed like a miracle. The colours swam back into the fibres, deep and true. For forty-eight hours, she believed she’d performed a resurrection.
Then, on the third morning, the change began subtly: a faint cloudiness to the restored green, like moss growing on a pond surface. By noon, the colour visibly leached away, not fading but retreating, pulling back from the threads and taking fragments of the original, centuries-old weave with it in a kind of panic. It didn’t fade; it unraveled from within. The scene was left ghostly, patchy, wounded.
The headline in the arts section said it all: ‘Restoration or Ruination? Museum’s “Miracle Cure” Destroys National Treasure.’ Beneath it, a photo from the staff page showed her smiling tightly, looking arrogant. A cautionary tale now. A ghost in the halls she’d walked for twelve years, her footsteps muffled by the same Turkish runner she’d helped choose for its low pile, ideal for rolling carts.
Her flat that evening was a silent accusation. The key turned in the lock with a sound like a final verdict. Stale air carried the faint, sweet-sour smell of overripe banana from the fruit bowl and the underlying, ever-present London damp that seeped through the brick. The rent was due in four days. The red light on her landline blinked—voicemail, probably her mother, her tone a careful, painful neutrality. The specialized world of textile conservation was a small, gossipy village; news of her disgrace would have already seeped into every curatorial office in the country, a stain spreading on clean linen.
She poured a large gin, the ice cracking like tiny bones, and stared at the blank, dark screen of her laptop, her own pale reflection a smudge against the black. Job sites, when forced open, offered nothing. ‘Textile Specialist’ roles demanded flawless records, ‘unimpeachable judgement’. ‘Museum Assistant’ positions paid less than her student loans demanded, the numbers a cold, impossible equation.
lengthening shadows swallowed the cheap IKEA bookcase with its rows of textile histories and conservation manuals. Each spine like a reproach. She thought of the threads, not as composite fibres, but as individual, screaming lines of colour being eaten from the inside out. Her hands, usually so steady, trembled slightly, making the gin shiver in the glass.
That’s when the post slithered through her letterbox. A single, thick sound in the evening quiet, more a thump than a rustle. As the London sky beyond her window deepened to a bruised purple, streaked with the sodium-orange glow of the city, it arrived. Not a bill—those came in thin, windowed envelopes—not junk mail—colourful, flimsy. A thick, cream envelope of heavy, watermarked paper that like pressed between her fingers. It had substantial weight, a dense promise. The address was handwritten in a precise, spidery copperplate that appeared to belong to another century, the ink a blue so dark it was nearly black, with subtle, hairline shading from a real nib. The return address, stamped in deep crimson wax rather than printed, simply read: The Village of Llanfair Historical Trust, The Village of Llanfair, Gwynedd. Frowning, she carried it to her kitchen table, the envelope seeming to grow heavier. The gin’s juniper scent was sharp in her nose. She used her bone folder—the very one from the box—to slit it open, the paper resisting with a soft, fibrous tear. Inside, on paper of the same weight and cream, the same hand laid out its stark, astonishing terms. The writing was flawless, but here and there, at the end of a line or the cross of a ‘t’, she detected a minute tremor, a faint scratch in the surface, as if the writer’s hand had been cold, or tired, or straining against a resistance. To Ms. Elara Hughes, The Trustees of the Village of Llanfair Historical Trust extend to you an invitation to undertake a private conservation project of a unique and delicate nature. The subject is a collection of domestic textiles, primarily embroideries, of significant local historical import. Their condition is fragile and their preservation is a matter of some urgency. The Trust offers a fixed fee of £25,000, payable upon satisfactory completion of the work. Accommodation will be provided in a cottage on the estate. All necessary materials and facilities will be supplied. The position requires your exclusive attention and residence in The Village of Llanfair for the duration, which is estimated not to exceed three months. We are aware of your recent professional difficulties. They are of no concern to us. Indeed, the specific nature of the failure suggests a certain… boldness of approach, which may suit our needs. You are asked to provide your answer by telephone to the number below within forty-eight hours. Should you agree, a car will be sent for you. Yours faithfully, Margred, For the Trustees. Below was a landline number with a Welsh dialling code. Elara Hughes read it twice. Then a third time, her eyes snagging on the phrases. ‘Aware of your recent professional difficulties.’ Heat flushed her neck and cheeks. ‘Of no concern to us.’ That was a lie, or a trap. Nobody hired a disgraced conservator out of charity. ‘The specific nature of the failure… boldness of approach.’ That was worse. It wasn’t forgiveness; it was selection. They wanted the very thing that had broken her. The fee was a lifeline, an absurd, glittering lifeline. Twenty-five thousand pounds. It would clear her debts, buy her time, maybe even a shred of a future. But the terms were a closed fist. Isolated residence. ‘Satisfactory completion.’ No details on the textiles, no condition reports, no images. Just ‘domestic embroideries’. It could be a pile of moth-eaten samplers. Or it could be something else entirely. She placed the letter on the table. The papeto drink the weak kitchen light, glowing with a faint, creamy luminescence. The wax seal on the envelope, now broken, showed a crude impression—not a crest, but what looked like a complex, interlocked knot, or perhaps a tangled briar. She ran her thumb over it. It was smooth, cold, and left a faint, powdery red residue on her skin that smelled not of beeswax, but of something earthier, like clay and dried herbs. For an hour, she sat in the darkening room, the city’s distant rumble a constant presence. She thought of the London Museum Conservation Lab (opening)’s silence, the feel of a fragile thread under her micro-tweezers, the profound satisfaction of stabilizing a tear, of granting not new life, but a reprieve from death. That was gone. This letter was something else. An exile, with a price tag. Her hand reached for her phone, then pulled back. She poured another gin, this time without ice. The alcohol burned a clean path down her throat, a temporary clarity. They know, she thought. They know and they want me anyway. Or because of it. The idea was repulsive. Seductive. She pictured a cottage in Wales. Silence that wasn’t accusatory, but simply quiet. Work for her hands. A task. The money was a wall between her and oblivion. But the wording… ‘a matter of some urgency’ for domestic embroideries? ‘Exclusive attention and residence’? It less like a job offer and more like a summoning. Finally, with the clock nearing eleven, the gin a low fire in her veins, she picked up her phone. Her finger hovered over the keypad. To call was to step into the unknown, to accept terms written in that strange, trembling hand. To refuse was to face the certain, grinding reality of tomorrow: the empty flat, the blinking voicemail light, the job sites with their digital closed doors. She dialled the number. It rang with a peculiar, hollow double tone, older than the standard British ring. Once, twice. On the third ring, it was answered. There was no greeting. A woman’s voice arrived down the line, clear but distant, as if speaking from the bottom of a well. It was aged, not with frailty, but with a kind of worn density, like stone steps smoothed by centuries. “Yes.” Elara Hughes’s mouth was dry. “I’m calling about the letter. For Elara Hughes.” “We know why you are calling.” The voice held no impatience, only a flat certainty. “Do you accept the terms?” No questions about her, no discussion. Simply the binary choice. Elara Hughes chill that had nothing to do with the draught from her window. “I… I need some details. What exactly am I to conserve? Can you send images? A condition report?” A pause. She heard what might have been the soft crackle of a fire, or static on the line. “The work is here. The details are here. The terms are as stated. Do you accept?” It was madness. Every professional instinct screamed. But her professional instincts had just burned her world down. What remained was fear, and need. The sharp, particulate dust of her old life was in her lungs. This was a door, even if it led into a dark room. “The fee,” Elara Hughes replied, her voice tighter than she intended. “Is it negotiable?” A faint sound, almost a sigh. “It is not. It is the fee. It is… appropriate to the task. Do you accept?” Appropriate to the task. The phrase hung in the air, loaded. Twenty-five thousand pounds for three months’ work on domestic embroidery was wildly over-generous. Unless the task was something else. “Yes,” Elara Hughes heard herself say. The word left her lips before her mind could fully cage it. “I accept.” “Extremely well.” There was no satisfaction in the voice, only a note of finality, like a key turning. “A car will collect you from your address at ten o’clock tomorrow morning. Bring only personal effects. Tools and materials are provided. Goodnight, Ms. Hughes.” The line went dead. Not a click, but a slow fade into silence, as if the connection had been stretched over a great distance and finally snapped. Elara Hughes sat holding the phone, the dial tone buzzing like an insect. It was done. She looked at the broken seal on the envelope, the tangled knot. The Horror of Inheritance, she thought randomly, a phrase from a long-ago university lecture. Being bound by debts you did not create. She ha merely st bound herself to one, for money. Tradition as a Prison. Was that what waited in Wales? Some mouldering pile of tradition, a family’s cursed linens? She spent the next hour packing a single suitcase with a numb, mechanical efficiency. Wool sweaters, sturdy trousers, her own worn-in apron. She packed the bone folder and her micro-tools case almost without thinking, a child’s security blanket. She left the ‘I ♥ Baroque Bobbins’ mug on the counter. Sleep, when it came, was thin and fractured. She dreamed not of tapestries, but of threads—single, endless threads being drawn from the dark, winding around her wrists, not tight, but insistent, pulling her forward. They were cold, and they hummed with a barely perceptible vibration. Morning arrived, grey and damp. At precisely ten, a car pulled up outside—a deep green, older-model Jaguar, polished to a liquid sheen but smelling faintly of damp leather and petrol when the driver opened the door for her. The driver was a man in his sixties, with a face like weathered oak and eyes that glanced at her, then through her. He nodded once. “Ms. Hughes. I’m Idris. The journey is long.” He loaded her case into the boot without another word. As they pulled away from the curb, Elara Hughes did not look back at her building. She watched London unravel behind her, the familiar streets giving way to motorways, then to smaller roads, the buildings shrinking, the air changing. The sharp, sooty tang of the city gradually faded, replaced by the wet green smell of fields and earth. Idris did not speak. The radio remained off. The only sounds were the purr of the engine and the rhythmic swipe of the windscreen wipers against a fine, misting rain. They crossed into Wales, and the land rose around them, becoming steeper, more muscular. Stone walls ribboned the hillsides. The sky lowered, a lid of soft, grey wool. After hours of driving, they turned onto a narrow lane hemmed by high, tangled hedges of hawthorn and blackthorn, their branches still clutching the ghosts of last year’s berries. The lane wound and dipped, and the daylight seemed appeared to, filtered through the dense canopy. The car’s headlights cut through a gathering twilight that premature. “The Village of Llanfair isn’t on the satnav,” Elara Hughes said, just to break the silence. Her voice sounded small in the quiet car. Idris’s eyes flicked to her in the mirror. They were a pale, watery blue. “No,” answeredaid, the word a stone dropped into a pool. “It keeps its own company.” Finally, the lane opened abruptly into a tiny, steep valley. The village of The Village of Llanfair lay nestled within it, a clutch of stone cottages with slate roofs the colour of a bruise, huddled around a thin ribbon of river. It was utterly still. No one moved in the gardens; no smoke rose from the chimneys, though the air had a deep, penetrating chill. The car rolled through the single street, its tires crunching on gravel. Faces, pale and indistinct, appeared briefly at windows, then withdrew. At the far end of the valley, set against a dark rise of wooded hillside, was a larger house. It was not a grand manor, but a severe, grey stone building with narrow windows, built into the slope as if it had grown there, a geological outcrop. Its walls were patched with lichen in sulphur-yellow and bone-white. This, she knew without asking, was the Trust’s estate. Idris drove past the house itself, following a rougher track that skirted its boundaries, and pulled up beside a small, solitary cottage a few hundred yards away. It was low, stone-built, with a squat chimney. A single light burned in its front window, a weak, yellow eye in the deepening gloom. “Here,” Idris said, cutting the engine. The sudden silence was immense, a physical pressure on the ears. It was broken only by the drip of water from the trees and the distant, cold chatter of the river. He got her case and set it by the cottage’s green-painted door. He did not offer to carry it inside. He stood for a moment, looking not at her, but at the dark bulk of the main house up the slope. His jaw worked slightly. “The workroom is in the big house. You’ll be shown tomorrow. Margred will come for you after breakfast.” He turned his pale eyes on her. For the first time, there was something in them—not warmth, but a kind of grim assessment. “The light is best before noon. After that… the shadows are long in the valley.” With that, he gave a curt nod and got back into the car, leaving her alone in the silent, damp clearing with her suitcase and the waiting cottage. The key was in the door. The interior was clean, spare, and cold. It smelled of woodsmoke, old stone, and a faint, sweet-under-rot scent of dried flowers left too long in a vase. The promised ‘facilities’ were basic: a slittlekitchen with an ancient electric stove, a sitting room with a hard sofa and a bookshelf empty save for a few mildewed paperback thrillers, a bedroom under the eaves with a narrow iron bed. The bathroom’s pipes groaned like wounded animals when she turned on the tap. The water thapproachedame out was ice-cold and tasted of peat. She built a fire in the small grate, her fingers clumsy with the unfamiliar kindling. The wood was damp and smoked bitterly before catching. The weak flame did little to push back the chill, only hollowed out a compact cave of flickering light in the room’s darkness. This was the silence after the mechanical sound ceased was worse than the noise itself. It was a held breath. Elara Hughes climbed into the iron bed, the sheets stiff and chilly, and lay listening to the nothing, and to the cottage’s inexplicable creaks—not the settling of old stone, but the subtle strain of a tightening griOnlyJust before a fitful sleep took her, the vision came: a needle, not her own fine conservator’s tool, but a large, blunt thing, being pushed slowly, with great effort, through a thickness of unyielding cloth. The sound it made was not a whisper, but a low, tearing groan.
She jerked awake, her own gasp loud in the dense dark. And in the echo of it, she heard the real sound—the one that wasn’t a dream. The same low, rhythmic scrape from the big house had returned. Only now, it was closer. It was in the garden.
Her hand flew to the coins of ice in her pocket, her mind to the letter’s trembling script: They understand the Corruption of Craft. They hadn’t just bought her skill. They had bought her presence here. The needle in her vision wasn’t mending; it was violating the weave. The sound outside her window was its echo in the real, breathing dark—a patient, methodical search. Not for her, she realized with a chill that stopped her heart. For the right thread to pull.
