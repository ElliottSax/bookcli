Chapter 10: The Naming

The final thread was not wool, but a filament of her own being. Elara sat before the monolithic loom, the weight of the unfinished pattern a physical pressure against her sternum. The workshop, her gilded cage for these last endless weeks, held its breath. Dust motes hung frozen in the thin, grey light seeping through the high window. The air smelled of lanolin, old wood, and the peculiar, sweet-rot scent of the dyestuffs—madder root and woad and something older, something dug from the black earth beneath the standing stones.

Her hands, once soft with academic ink-stains, now bore the map of her captivity: calluses, fine cuts from the spindles, a permanent, grimy crescent under each nail. They moved now without her conscious command, as they had more and more these past days. The entity within the loom—through the loom—guided them. It was a cold, silent puppeteer, its strings threaded into her motor nerves. She watched, a passenger in her own body, as her left hand lifted the silver shears.

A hank of her own hair, the colour of tarnished copper, lay on the bench beside her. She had cut it at dawn, a last, futile act of autonomy. Now, her right hand selected a single, long strand. It caught the light, a vibrant, human thread against the tapestry’s eldritch panorama.

The tapestry itself was a masterpiece of terror. It depicted Llanfair, but a Llanfair seen through a malevolent, timeless eye. The village was there, the chapel, the winding river, but the perspective was wrong—as if viewed from a great height, or from beneath the soil. The woods were not composed of individual trees, but of a single, creeping, woolen mass, like mould. And at the centre, where the village green should be, was the stone altar, a knot of such intricate, dark stitching it seemed to be a hole into which the rest of the world was draining. The border was not a geometric pattern, but a procession of figures, woven in a stark, simplified style. They carried a shrouded form. The last figure, the one just before the gap her hair would fill, was unmistakably Griffith, his woven face a mask of serene triumph.

Her hands brought the strand to the warp. The entity’s anticipation was a wave of glacial water rising up her spine. She could feel its consciousness, a vast, patient, hungry thing, woven into every fibre of the place. It had been tasting her memories—the smell of her mother’s perfume, the feel of a university library chair, the sharp grief for her grandmother—savouring them before consumption. It had shown her its own: endless cycles of seasons seen from a fixed point in the grove, the feel of rain on moss, the slow, delicious dread of generations of weavers, the final, screaming moment of transfer as one vessel was emptied and another filled.

“No grand defiance,” she whispered, her voice raspy from disuse. It was part of the plan, the pathetic, desperate plan she and Bronwyn had concocted in whispers after her failed escape. The old wo
