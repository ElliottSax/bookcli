    "Character names are inconsistent. Chapter 1 introduces 'Miss Sherlock Holmes' (a pseudonym). The middle chapter introduces a completely different group: 'Lady Arabella Fitzwilliam', 'Miss Eliza Bennett', 'Mrs. Charlotte Lucas', and 'Miss Lydia Wickham' as the 'Spinster Detective Society'. The final chapter returns to a Baker Street setting but with yet another new cast: 'Miss Eleanor Holmes', 'Mrs. Eliza Watson', 'Miss Charlotte Bronte', and 'Miss Ada Lovelace'.",
    "Setting details are contradictory. Chapter 1 establishes the detective agency's office on 'Gower Street' (above a haberdashery). The middle chapter places the 'Spinster Detective Society' in a 'quaint, ivy-covered cottage on the outskirts of London'. The final chapter places the society in a 'quaint townhouse on Baker Street'.",
    "The protagonist/leader of the detective agency changes completely. Chapter 1 focuses on a single woman (Miss Sherlock Holmes) starting her own agency. The middle and final chapters feature a pre-existing society/agency with a different leader and multiple core members from the outset, with no narrative bridge explaining this shift.",
    "The timeline and foundational plot are inconsistent. Chapter 1 is about the *founding moment* of 'London\u2019s first female detective agency'. The final chapter states the 'Spinster Detective Society' has been open for a year, but it features different characters and a different location than the one being founded in Chapter 1. The core premise from Chapter 1 is abandoned."
