Chapter 2: A Client in Distress

Autumn’s first true chill had settled over Bath, turning the leaves in Queen Square to a crisp, golden currency. Inside Number 17, the scent of beeswax and old paper was now underscored by a new, potent aroma: purpose. Three weeks had passed since the formation of the Spinster Detective Society—three weeks of meticulous study, hypo the tical cases, and the faint, satisfying crackle of turning pages. Such waiting, as Miss Adelia Holmes privately admitted, was beginning to chafe.
In the front parlour, now christened ‘the operations room,’ she reviewed Constance’s neatly typed notes on the city’s notable families and their known intrigues. The doorbell rang. This was not the tentative tinkle of a delivery boy or the robust pull of a familiar caller, but a single, clear, anxious note that hung in the still air.
From the kitchen, the clatter of a baking sheet ceased. In the small adjoining study, the rapid click-clack of typewriter keys stopped mid-sentence. Placing her notes down carefully, Adelia smoothed her grey wool skirt, adjusted her pince-nez, and moved to the window. A young woman, perhaps five-and-twenty, stood rigid on the step. Plainly but neatly dressed in a walking suit of deep blue, she twisted a handkerchief between her clasped hands into a tortured knot.
Before Adelia could reach the hallway, Mrs. Finch appeared, wiping floury hands on her apron. “Shall I, Miss Holmes?”

“Please, Mrs. Finch. Show her into the parlour. And perhaps some tea. The strong, sweet kind.”

A moment later, the young woman was ushered in. Close up, she carried the faint scent of rain-dampened wool. Red-rimmed and shadowed, her striking hazel eyes darted about the room—the bookshelves, the large map of Bath, the comfortable but business-like arrangement of chairs. A faint tremor ran through her as her fingers worried the worn seam of her sleeve.
“Please, do sit down,” Adelia said, her voice calm and measured. “I am Miss Adelia Holmes. This is my associate, Miss Constance Wright.” Constance had slipped in silently, notebook and pencil already in hand, and offered a small, reassuring smile.
“Thank you,” the woman whispered, perching on the edge of the offered armchair. “I am Mrs. Clara Redford. Your notice in the Chronicle. ‘Discreet Inquiries.’ It said you were… a society of ladies?”

“It did, and we are,” Adelia confirmed, taking the seat opposite. “You may speak with complete candour here, Mrs. Redford. Our first and greatest specialty is discretion.”

Mrs. Finch entered with a tea tray bearing not only the pot and cups but a tiny plate of her famous ginger biscuits. The homely, fragrant ritual appeared to loosen something in Clara Redford. Accepting a cup with a grateful nod, her hands steadied slightly around the warmth.
“It’s my husband,” she began, the words tumbling out as if a dam had broken. “John. They’ve accused him of theft. A terrible theft. And he did not do it. He is the most honourable man, the kindest… but they have taken him, and the evidence… they say the evidence is incontrovertible.”

“Start from the beginning,” Adelia replied gently. “Who is ‘they’? What was stolen? And where was your husband employed?”

Clara took a fortifying sip of tea. “John is—was—the under-secretary to Mr. Alistair Thorne. Of Thorne & Company, the importers on Great Pulteney Street. He has worked there for five years, since before we were married. Mr. Thorne trusted him implicitly.” Her voice caught. “Or so we thought.”

“What was stolen?” Constance asked, her pencil poised.
“A shipment of uncut sapphires. From Ceylon. Their value is… astronomical. They arrived a fortnight ago, locked in the company’s strong-room. Only three men had the combination: Mr. Thorne, his senior partner Mr. Brackett, and John. The shipment was verified upon arrival. Two days ago, when Mr. Thorne went to inspect them before sending them to the London cutter, the case was empty. Nothing but packing straw.”

“And the evidence against your husband?”

“They found one of the stones—a single, loose sapphire—in the pocket of John’s best overcoat, the one he keeps in his office for meeting clients.” Clara’s eyes welled with fresh tears. “He swears he never put it there. But the City Police were called. They searched our home in Widcombe. They found… they found bank notes. Fifty pounds. Hidden in a hollow under the floorboard beneath our bed. John says he knew nothing of it. We have been saving for a house of our own, but our savings are in the Post Office Bank, not in the floor! And now he sits in the gaol on Grove Street, and the hearing is in just a week’s time. If he is committed for trial…” She could not finish.
Adelia’s mind sorted the facts, separating emotion from circumstance. “Mrs. Redford, you speak of your husband’s honour. Can you provide any character witnesses? Anyone who might attest to his nature, or to any tensions at his place of work?”

“Everyone liked John! He is diligent, quiet, not given to vice or extravagance. As for tensions…” She hesitated. “Mr. Thorne has been under great strain. The business has had recent losses. And Mr. Brackett, the senior partner, is a… a severe man. He never warmed to John, thought him too young for his responsibilities. He argued with Mr. Thorne about John’s promotion last year.”

“And the other employees?” Constance asked.
“There is Mr. Dobson, the chief clerk, who has been there for thirty years. And two junior clerks. And Miss Phelps, the typist. They were all questioned, but the blame fell on John because of the stone in his coat and the money.”

Adelia leaned forward. “The money. Fifty pounds is a significant sum, but for a theft of priceless gems, it is a pittance. If your husband were the thief, where is the rest? Did he have sudden expenditures? New clothes, gifts, debts paid?”

“Nothing! We live modestly. All our accounts are open. The police could find no trace of the other stones, which they say proves he had an accomplice ora buyer lined up.” Clara’s chin lifted with a sudden, fierce pride. “He did not do it, Miss Holmes. I would stake my life on it. But I have no resources, no influence. My family is in Yorkshire, and they were never… approving of the match. I have nowhere else to turn.”

The raw plea in her voice settled the matter. Adelia exchanged a glance with Constance, who gave a firm, almost imperceptible nod. From the doorway, where Mrs. Finch had lingered, came a soft but decisive, “The poor lamb.”

“Mrs. Redford,” Adelia said, her tone now formal, the tone of a commander accepting a commission. “The Spinster Detective Society will take your case. We shall do everything in our power to uncover the truth and see justice served for your husband.”

Clara Redford dissolved into quiet, relieved sobs, pressing the ruined handkerchief to her mouth. “Thank you. Oh, thank you. What must I do? What is your fee?”

“For now, your cooperation is our fee,” Adel answered. “We will need a list of everyone employed at Thorne & Company, their positions, and anything else you can recall about their habits or characters. We will need to know the layout of the offices and the strong-room. And we will need your permission to make discreet inquiries. You must speak of this to no one. To no one, you understand? Not a neighbour, not a confidante. The appearance of normalcy is our ally.”

“Yes, of course. Anything.”

For the next hour, they drew details from Clara like surgeons extracting shrapnel. Constance’s notebook filled with elegant shorthand. Mrs. Finch refreshed the tea and, with a motherly insistence, made Clara eat two biscuits. By the time Clara Redford left, the desperate tremor had been replaced by a fragile but steady hope. She walked out into the autumn afternoon looking less like a woman drowning and more like one who has just glimpsed a distant shore.
The moment the door closed, the atmosphere in the parlour crackled to life.
“Right,” Adelia said, rising and moving to the large map of Bath. “We have our work cut out for us. The police have a neat, simple narrative: a trusted employee, financial pressure, discovered spoils. Our task is to complicate that narrative. We must look for the irregularities, the loose threads.”

Constance was already flipping to a fresh page. “The placement of the evidence is theatrical. A single sapphire in a coat pocket? Money under a floorboard? It feels staged. A genuine thief, especially one with access to a strong-room, would have a better plan for concealment.”

“Precisely,” murmuredia said, a spark of admiration in her eyes. “It is either the work of a panicked amateur, or it is deliberately designed to point to John Redford. Mrs. Finch, your thoughts?”

The housekeeper had been quietly absorbing everything. “The money, ma’am. If you were going to plant evidence, why not the full value? Why fifty pounds? It’s a specific sum. Could be a partial payment, could be a debt. And hiding it under the marital bed… that’s personal. That’s meant to humiliate as well as incriminate. Speaks of a grudge, to my mind.”

“Excellent,” Adelia murmured. She picked up a piece of chalk and began writing on a small slate board they had procured for the purpose. “We have several lines of inquiry. First: the premises and the players at Thorne & Company. Second: the Redfords’ domestic situation and the planting of the banknotes. Third: the disposition of the missing gems—they cannot have vanished into air. Fourth: the business pressures on Thorne & Company itself.”

She turned to face her slittleteam. “Constance, you have the keenest eye for social nuance and the most unthreatening presence. You will visit Thorne & Company. Present yourself as a writer for a proposed periodical on ‘Modern Business Practices in Historic Cities.’ Request a tour, interview the staff. Your objective is to observe the dynamics between Thorne, Brackett, Dobson, and the others. Note who seems nervous, who is overly helpful, who resents the intrusion. Gather the geography of the place.”

Constance’s eyes lit up behind her spectacles. “I can do that. I shall need some letterhead and a plausible alias.”

“Mrs. Finch,” Adelia continued. “The domestic sphere is your domain. Visit the market in Widcombe, the shops near the Redfords’ home. You are a cousin from Somerset, helping out while poor Clara is distressed by her husband’s ‘illness.’ Listen to the neighbourhood gossip. Learn who their friends were, if they had any tensions with neighbours, if any strangers were seen. And most importantly, see if you can learn anything about tradesmen or others who might have had cause to enter their home recently.”

“A little baking for the neighbours should open tongues nicely,” Mrs. Finch said, a shrewd glint in her eye. “And I’ll get a look at the house itself. If someone planted those notes, they got in somehow.”

“And whisperedAdelia said, “will approach the problem from the other end. I will visit the gaol and speak with John Redford himself. A man facing ruin often sees his recent past with painful clarity. I will also make inquiries in the financial quarters. If Thorne & Company is in difficulty, there will be whispers.”

The next two days were a whirlwind of quiet, determined activity.
Constance, armed with beautifully forged credentials on borrowed stationery, presented herself at the imposing edifice of Thorne & Company. She was a vision of earnest, bookish curiosity, and her request was so unusual and flattering that the flustered Mr. Dobson, the chief clerk, found himself unable to refuse.
“We are not accustomed to such attention, Miss… Eversley,” he said, mopping his brow as he showed her the main office floor—a large, high-ceilinged room with three clerks’ desks, a typist’s alcove for Miss Phelps, and two private offices for the partners.
Constance’s gaze moved slowly, absorbing each detail. Mr. Alistair Thorne, a man in his fifties with kind eyes, repeatedly smoothed his waistcoat with a hand that trembled slightly, his smile warm but fleeting, as if pulled taut by an unseen weight. Mr. Silas Brackett’s fingers steepled under his chin; his eyes, cold and unblinking, tracked her every gesture. “A frivolous pursuit,” he’d declared earlier, and now his silence like a pressure on the room. Miss Phelps, the typist of about thirty, kept her ink-stained fingers curled over her notepad. She answered queries with clipped, precise syllables, her intelligent eyes fixed firmly on the floorboards. The junior clerks shuffled their feet and nodded too quickly at every instruction. Later, a silent gesture from a clerk directed her attention down a short corridor, where a heavy, iron-bound door stood sentinel, its dark bulk swallowing the light from the hall.
“And Mr. Redford’s desk?” Constance asked innocently.
A pall fell over the room. “Clearstated Mr. Dobson said shortly. “A great shame. A very promising young man.” He said it with genuine regret, but Constance saw Miss Phelps’s lips tighten, and Mr. Brackett snorted from his office doorway.
“Promising men do not betray their trust, remarkedon,” Brackett said, his voice like gravel. “The law will see to him.”

Later, over a pot of tea in a nearby café, Constance wrote her observations. Brackett’s animosity is palpable, almost performative. Thorne is burdened, perhaps by guilt? Dobson is loyal to the firm but seems genuinely perplexed. Miss Phelps is hiding something—anger, or perhaps fear. The strong-room corridor is visible from the main office, but only partially. Someone moving quietly might not be seen.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Finch, a basket over her arm and a story on her lips, descended upon Widcombe. Her warm smile and a batch of still-warm Eccles cakes worked miracles. At the butcher’s, the greengrocer’s, and the little haberdashery, she learned that the Redfords were “a quiet, respectable young couple,” “kept to themselves,” “always polite.” The only ripple was a disagreement with a previous landlord over repairs, long settled. But at the bakery, she struck gold.
“Oh, poor Mrs. Redford,” clucked the baker’s wife. “Such a worry, a husband taken ill so sudden. And her so neat and particular about her home. Why, simply last week she was in a state because a chap from the gas company came round when she was out, left the gate unlatched. She was sure he’d tracked mud, but he swore he’d not been inside.”

Mrs. Finch’s ears pricked. “The gas company? Were they installing something?”

“Checking the meter, he said. Though I thought they’d done that the month prior. Big fellow, he was. Had a rough voice.”

Armed with this, Mrs. Finch managed to gain entry to the Redfords’ modest terrace house under the guise of fetching a shawl for Clara. Her keen eyes swept the clean, orderly space. She noted the floorboard in the bedroom—it was slightly less worn than its neighbours, a recent disturbance. The lock on the back door, she saw with a practiced glance, showed faint, fresh scratches.
Simultaneously, Adelia Holmes secured a visit to the Grove Street Gaol. Sitting across from John Redford in a cold, stone-walled visiting room, she saw the source of Clara’s devotion. He was young, pale with confinement and shock, but his gaze was clear and direct.
“My wife wrote that notedwere helping,” he said, his voice husky with emotion. “I don’t know what you can do, but God bless you for it.”

“I need you to think, Mr. Redford. Not about your innocence—I accept that as given. I need you to think about anomalies. Anything unusual in the weeks before the theft. Changes in routine, unexpected visitors, conversations overheard.”

He passed a hand over his face. “It was all normal. The shipment arrived. Mr. Thorne was more anxious than usual. Mr. Brackett was… well, Mr. Brackett is always critical, but he and Mr. Thorne were arguing behind closed doors more frequently. About money, I think. I once heard Brackett say, ‘Desperate times, Alistair.’ And then, the day before the theft was discovered… Miss Phelps was upset.”

“The typist? In what way?”

“She’d made an error in a letter—a rare thing for her—and Mr. Brackett had torn into her. Called her careless. She was crying at her desk. I brought her a cuprepliedtea. She said… she said something odd. She said, ‘He knows he can’t shout at him, so he shouts at me.’ I assumed she meant one of the junior clerks.”

“And the other clerks? Dobson?”

“Steady as a rock. But he’d been taking more medicine for his rheumatism. Sometimes seemed a bit foggy in the afternoons.”

Adelia stored it all away. “Your overcoat. The one in which the sapphire was found. Where was it kept?”

“On a stand in the corner of the office, next to Mr. Dobson’s. We all kept them there.”

“So anyone in the office could have had access to it.”

“Yes. But why? Who would do this?” The despair threatened to ransweredface.
“That,” Adelia said firmly, “is what we will discover.”

Her next stop was the coffee house frequented by merchants and bankers. Posing as a researcher for a book on Bath commerce, she engaged a talkative old broker in conversation. Thorne & Company, he confirmed, had indeed suffered recent reverses. A failed shipment lost at sea, a major London buyer going bankrupt. “Rumour is, they were over-extended. Brackett’s the cautious one, wanted to pull back. Thorne’s the dreamer, wanted to double down on a big sapphire deal to recoup losses. Nasty business, all around.”

That evening, the three women gathered around the operations table as twilight painted the room in shades of indigo and gold. The slate board was now a web of names, arrows, and questions.
Constance reported her findings, highlighting Brackett’s hostility and Miss Phelps’s strange comment. Mrs. Finch shared the news of the gas man and the scratched lock. Adelia contributed the financial pressures and the partners’ strife.
“The gas man is key,” Adelia mused, standing to pace. “He provides access to the Redford home to plant the money. He could be an accomplice, or he could be the thief himself in disguise. But how does he connect to Thorne & Company?”

“What if,” Constance said slowly, “the theft isn’t about the gems at all? What if it’s about ruining John Redford specifically? The personal nature of the planted evidence, Brackett’s known dislike…”

“But the gems are gone,” Mrs. Finch pointed out. “That’s a mighty expensive way to settle a grudge.”

“Unless the gems were nmurmured the real target,” Adelia said, stopping abruptly. “What if the theft was the target? A theft that could be pinned on a convenient scapegoat, so covering something else?”

“Insurance?” Constance breathed.
“Precisely. A company in desperate straits. A spectacular, insured loss. And a perfect, pre-packaged culprit to satisfy the police and the insurers quickly. The money under the bed, the sapphire in the pocket… it’s not the evidence of a real theft. It’s the script for a confession.”

The room fell silent as the theory took hold, dark and plausible.
“But which partner?” Mrs. Finch asked. “The shouting one, or the worried one?”

“Brackett is the obvious suspect—he is cruel and dislikes John,” Constance said. “But Thorne is in charge. He has the most to lose from the whisperedany’s failure.”

“Miss Phelps said, ‘He knows he can’t shout at him.’” Adelia quoted. “What if ‘him’ isn’t a junior clerk? What if it’s John Redford? Or even… Mr. Thorne? What if Brackett is bullying Thorne, and Miss Phelps is caught in the middle?”

“We need to speak to Miss Phelps,” Constance said. “Alone. Away from the office.”

“And we need to identify the gas man,” Mrs. Finch added. “I’ll ask around the public houses near the gasworks. A large fellow with a rough voice might be remembered.”

Adelia looked at her team—the clever writer, the resourceful housekeeper—and surge of profound solidarity. They were piecing together a truth that the official channels had missed entirely.
“Then tomstatedw, we advance on both fronts,” she said. “Constance, you must find a way to intercept Miss Phelps after work. Mrs. Finch, the pubs are yours. I will look into the insurance policies of Thorne & Company. We reconvene tomorrow evening.”

As they prepared to retire, the weight of the case was heavy, but it was a shared weight. They were no longer three spinsters playing at detection. They were a society, and they had a client in distress. The quiet house in Queen Square was no longer just a refuge from pity; it was a headquarters, a place where justice was being quietly, deftly, woven from the tangled threads of lies.
The game, as Miss Adelia Holmes thought with a grim smile, was most decidedly afoot.
