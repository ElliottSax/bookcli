    "chapter_01.md: SCORE: 6/10 | ISSUES: exposition-heavy narration, anachronistic phrasing (\"gap in the market\"), abrupt scene transition\n\n**Writing Quality:** 7/10. Competent and clear, but leans heavily on telling rather than showing.\n**Dialogue Naturalness:** 6/10. Functional but slightly stiff and expository (e.g., Mr. Thompson's speech).\n**Pacing:** 5/10. Rushed; major life decisions (lease, team) are handled in summary without tension or depth.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n1. **Exposition-heavy:** The opening is an info-dump of backstory and motive.\n2. **Anachronistic language:** Phrases like \"gap in the market\" and \"TLC\" feel modern for 1895.\n3. **Rushed plotting:** The lease signing lacks conflict or detail, and the interview scene cuts off abruptly.",
    "chapter_06.md: SCORE: 6/10 | ISSUES: Info-dump character introductions, stilted dialogue, abrupt ending.\n\n1. **Writing Quality:** 7/10. Competent and descriptive, but leans into clich\u00e9 (\"crisp air,\" \"heart and soul,\" \"wild card\").\n2. **Dialogue Naturalness:** 5/10. Feels expository and functional; characters speak to assign plot tasks rather than converse naturally.\n3. **Pacing:** 6/10. Halts completely for a full paragraph of character introductions, making the start feel static before the plot resumes.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n1. **Character Intro Info-Dump:** The sequential, detailed descriptions of each character are a static block of exposition.\n2. **On-the-Nose Dialogue:** The conversation is purely for planning and defining roles, lacking subtext or natural flow.\n3. **Incomplete Excerpt:** The chapter cuts off mid-sentence (\"the Spinst\"), which",
    "chapter_10.md: SCORE: 6/10 | ISSUES: exposition-heavy dialogue, \"as you know, Bob\" syndrome, static scene\n\n**Writing Quality:** 7/10. Competent and clear, but leans toward clich\u00e9 (\"warm, golden hue,\" \"heart swelled with pride\").\n\n**Dialogue Naturalness:** 4/10. Stilted and expositional. Characters tell each other things they already know to inform the reader (\"I remember the first time we received a case...\").\n\n**Pacing:** 5/10. The scene is static and reflective, lacking forward momentum or tension until the final paragraph.\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n1. **\"As you know, Bob\" Dialogue:** The conversation exists solely for recap, not natural character interaction.\n2. **Tell-don't-show:** The society's history and impact are stated directly rather than revealed through action or subtext.\n3. **Character Introduction Overload:** The first paragraph is a checklist of names"
