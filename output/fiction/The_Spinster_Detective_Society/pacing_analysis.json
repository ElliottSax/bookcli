  "analysis": "HOOK: 7 | TENSION: 4 | TRANSITIONS: 6 | FIX: Overly detailed character introductions in Chapter 6.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Hook Strength (7):** The opening is strong and establishes a clear, intriguing premise\u2014a woman in Victorian London adopting the \"Sherlock Holmes\" name to start a female detective agency. It efficiently sets character, setting, and central conflict (societal expectations vs. ambition). It loses points for a slight dip into exposition after the initial grab.\n\n2.  **Tension Building (4):** The pacing is largely expository and atmospheric, prioritizing setup over immediate narrative drive. In Chapter 1, the tension is potential (the risk of her venture) rather than active. Chapter 6 halts the plot entirely for a detailed, static introduction of a new cast. The \"sense of anticipation\" is told, not shown through action or dialogue, causing the tension to stall.\n\n3. ",
