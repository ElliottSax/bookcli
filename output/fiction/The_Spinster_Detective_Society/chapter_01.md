Chapter 1: The Unlikely Entrepreneur

London, 1895. Overnight, the persistent fog had retreated to the river, leaving the city washed in a thin, aqueous light that did little to warm the red-brick facades of Baker Street. In a first-floor sitting room, the woman known to a select, desperate few as the city’s most logical mind sat perfectly still, her gaze fixed on the open ledger before her. Columned in her own precise hand, the numbers were a lie. A deliberate, necessary fiction. Beside the inkwell, a brass astrolabe’s intricate cogs sat frozen in silent, celestial testimony—the only key to the murder it concealed, a murder the official records called a tragic accident.

Her name was Miss Sherlock Holmes.

Of course, she was no relation. The name was a borrowed weapon, a piece of psychological armour donned seven years ago. Then, a clever woman of five-and-twenty, facing a blackmailer with evidence to ruin a duchess, required immediate, intimidating credibility. “Holmes” conjured a gaunt, relentless figure in a deerstalker, a genius of deduction whose very name silenced questions. “Miss” was the twist, the subversion, the detail that made people lean in, confused and curious. Now thirty-two, a ‘confirmed spinster’ by society’s ledger, she wore the title not as a scar but as a hidden dagger. It freed her from the exhausting theatre of marriage markets and drawing-room politics. Her true vocation was a silent, relentless engine within: the solving of things. Puzzles of human motive, patterns in chaos, the lies people told not just with their tongues but with a hand’s tremble, a boot’s scuff, the contradictions in their accounting books.

Today, however, the puzzle was her own future. The astrolabe’s case—solved three weeks prior for a grieving astronomer—had provided the final fee. The last of the old life.

With a decisive stroke, she blotted the final figure. Deep indigo ink soaked into the thick paper. At last, the numbers agreed. They did not sing; they simply ceased their argument, whispering a single, terrifying, exhilarating possibility: London’s first female detective agency, a phantom in her mind for years, was not a daydream. It was a balance sheet. Rent, a discreet advertisement in The Times, coal, stationery, and the sturdy lock for the office—all were accounted for, with a slender, defiant buffer of seventeen pounds, four shillings, and sixpence remaining.

A profound, settling quiet descended, like the final, oiled piece of a complex lock sliding home. The morning sounds—the distant clatter of a milk cart, the murmur of the landlady, Mrs. Turner, in the hall—receded. She stood, her practical navy skirts of heavy wool whispering a soft counter-rhythm against the horsehair chair. Beyond the window, the world became a diorama of ordinary miracles. A hansom cab rattled past, the horse’s breath pluming in the chill air. From a window above the bakery, a maid in a faded blue dress shook a rug, her movements a study in violent, practical grace. Beneath a gas lamp, its flame pale in the daylight, a gentleman in a top-hat paused to consult his pocket watch, his face a mask of peevish urgency.

How many secrets did that single street scene hold? The cabbie perhaps hid a debt. The maid possibly pocketed a lost shilling. The gentleman was likely late for an appointment that was not what he told his wife. How many desperate clients, how many hidden crimes and festering injustices waited just beyond the pane, believing they had nowhere to turn?

She would be the turn. The name on the door. The mind behind the inquiry.

Crisp and waiting in her portmanteau beside the desk lay the lease for the Gower Street office. The space was raw: two rooms above a haberdashery, smelling of dust, sizing starch, and immense, echoing potential. The front room, with its large window overlooking the street, would be her consulting room. The smaller, interior room would serve as a private study, a laboratory for thought. Imperfect. Perfect.

At eleven, Mr. Alistair Thompson would be waiting at his solicitor’s office in Chancery Lane, his kindness tinged with a paternalistic doubt—a metallic, familiar taste at the back of her throat. To him, she was a genteel woman of moderate means with an eccentric, perhaps tragic, hobby. The forensic mind remained invisible, though it had already catalogued everything during their single viewing: the three separate wear patterns on his shoes (outer right heel, inner left sole, a curious scrape on the toe—a man who stood with uneven weight, favoured his left side, and kicked a stubborn doorstop); his fondness for peppermints (a faint, sharp scent clinging to his waistcoat, a tiny crystalline smear on his cuff); his anxiety over a daughter in Brighton (the postmark on the letter half-protruding from his coat pocket, the feminine script, the way his fingers had brushed it unconsciously, a talisman of worry).

Miss Holmes placed a wide-brimmed, unadorned hat upon her chestnut hair, anchoring it with a single, sharp pin. Her usually steady fingers betrayed a minute tremor, which she observed with clinical detachment. Adrenaline, not fear. The body’s preparation for engagement. A bright, sharp thread of excitement—a sensation she so rarely permitted—ran through her blood, woven through with the colder, stronger fibre of dread. This was no lady’s charitable endeavour, no polite pastime like watercolours or good works. It was a declaration of war on obscurity, on the assumption that complexity was the sole province of men. Failure meant not just financial ruin and a retreat to genteel poverty, but the smug, silent validation of every raised eyebrow, every condescending smile, every “I-told-you-so” from a society that believed a woman’s mind was a shallow pond, not a deep, dark well.

A final glance took in the chaotic desk: the ledger, now closed; the astrolabe, its brass dull in the grey light; a magnifying glass; a pile of newspapers with certain articles circled in red ink; arevolver, unloaded, in a drawer—a tool of psychological theatre more than violence. This room had been her cockpit for years. Now, she was leaving the nest. She turned, her hand lingering for a moment on the cool doorknob, and descended to the street.

The city’s great, hungry murmur—the rumble of wheels, the cry of vendors, the composite hum of a million lives—swallowed the sound of her footsteps on the pavement. She drew the air deep into her lungs: coal smoke, horse dung, the faint, sweet decay of autumn leaves from the square, the ever-present tang of the Thames. The game, she thought, the old, familiar phrase taking on a new, profound weight, at long last, is mine to play. The board is set. The pieces are moving.
The conviction carried her across London, from the brisk, anonymous streets of Marylebone to the hushed, wood-panelled sanctums of Chancery Lane. The mental armour she had donned that morning did not shed with her coat in the solicitor’s vestibule; it merely shifted, its plates becoming less about physical anonymity and more about impenetrable professionalism. Here, the weapons were documents and precedent, not footprints and cigarette ash. Here, the battlefield was a desk, and the victory a signature.

As the cab halted before the imposing granite facade of Number 42, she felt the familiar, sharpening focus, the world narrowing to essential details. The time for preparation was over. The performance had begun.

She paid the cabbie, noting the raw redness of his knuckles—a new driver, still learning the reins—and stepped onto the curb. The building loomed like a silent judge, its windows blind eyes of polished glass. A deep breath of chilled city air, now flavoured with stone dust and the faint, acrid scent of legal ink from a nearby print-shop, steeled her nerves. She adjusted her gloves, a simple pair of grey kid leather, and pushed through the heavy brass and oak door.

Inside, the street’s chaos was snuffed out as if by a bell jar. A carpeted silence, thick and expensive, absorbed all sound. The air was warm, still, smelling of lemon oil, old paper, and a faint, floral perfume from the vase of hothouse lilies on the reception desk. The distant, muffled groan of a hydraulic elevator felt a world away. This lobby was a temple of quiet power, designed to intimidate the uncertain and reassure the wealthy.

“Miss Holmes for Mr. Thompson,” she said to the young clerk, his hair parted with razor precision. Her voice was neither timid nor strident, but a clear statement of fact.

“Of course. He is expecting you. Third floor, second door on the right.” The clerk’s eyes flickered over her, a quick, professional assessment that categorised her as ‘unremarkable, female, possibly a secretary or poor relation.’ She was grateful for the invisibility.

Her heels sank into the deep, burgundy pile of the staircase runner as she ascended, eschewing the elevator. The physical act of climbing focused her. With each step, the strategist within her settled, her mind cooling from the fervour of creation to the calm of execution. She reviewed her opening gambit: firm, polite, devoid of justification. The lease was a business proposition, not a petition.

On the third floor, the silence was even deeper. She found the door: a dark oak slab with a polished brass plaque: Alistair Thompson, Solicitor & Commissioner for Oaths. She knocked, twice, firm and even.

“Enter.”
Mr. Thompson’s office was a capsule of curated warmth, smelling richly of beeswax, fine pipe tobacco (Latakia, she noted), and the faint, sweet scent of port lingering in a crystal decanter. He rose from a chair that was more a throne of green leather, his smile a practiced curve of goodwill that reached his mouth but left his pale blue eyes watchful and assessing.

“Miss Holmes. Punctual as the noon bell. Please, come in.”

The room was a stage set for his performance. Every leather-bound book, every curated antique paperweight, every diploma in its heavy frame was a prop designed to impress and disarm, to speak of stability, tradition, and unassailable authority. The light from a tall window fell across a Persian rug, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air like tiny, suspended worlds.

She accepted his offered hand, her grip firm and measured, meeting his pressure exactly without exceeding it. A familiar dance, she thought, her mind partitioning itself: one part engaged in the social ritual, another, colder part observing from a height. False comfort before the real conversation begins. The offer of sherry, the comment on the weather—the prelude to negotiation.

“Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Thompson.”

“Not at all, not at all. A pleasure.” He released her hand and gestured to a chair opposite his desk, its leather less supple, its posture subtly less comfortable than his own. “Do sit. May I offer you some tea? Or perhaps a little sherry? It’s a sharp morning.”

“No, thank you. I am quite well.” She sat, arranging her skirts, her back not touching the chair’s spine. Alert posture. Readiness. She placed her portmanteau on the floor beside her, within easy reach.

As she took the seat, her eyes, seeming to wander politely over the shelves, catalogued the details: the carefully placed silver-framed photograph of a wife and two daughters (the wife’s smile tight, the daughters’ likenesses several years out of date); the prestigious awards from the Law Society on the wall (the newest, five years old); a small, exquisite model of a clipper ship under glass (a father’s profession, perhaps; a nostalgia for adventure he himself did not pursue). Testaments to a life of curated success. She also noted the slight, shiny wear on the right arm of the visitor’s chair, the too-perfect alignment of the ivory-handled pens on his blotter, the complete absence of any pending paperwork on the vast desktop. A man who controls every detail, who stages his own competence, and who is, at this moment, slightly bored.

He settled back into his throne, steepling his fingers, the pads touching lightly. His nails were impeccably clean, buffed to a soft shine.

“Now.” The single word hung in the tobacco-scented air, a gentle gavel fall. “Let’s discuss what brings you here. The rooms on Gower Street. Charming building. The haberdasher, Mr. Higgins, is a most respectable tenant.”

“Ah, Miss Holmes!” he began again, as if launching into a rehearsed speech. “You have the papers, I trust? And the, ah, requisite consideration?” He said ‘consideration’ with a delicate emphasis, making the rent sound like a favour he was accepting.

He’s already decided to humour me, she thought, noting the slight, patronising tilt of his head, the way his eyes flickered almost imperceptibly to the ormolu clock on the mantel behind her. A busy man, indulging a whimsical, possibly deluded, client. He is performing patience.

“I have, Mr. Thompson,” she replied, her voice a calm, clear bell in the stuffy room. She did not fumble. She opened the portmanteau, withdrew the folded lease and a sealed envelope containing the banknotes, and extended them across the polished expanse of the desk. The gesture was firm and businesslike, her wrist straight. This is not a request for guidance or approval. It is a transaction. “The lease, reviewed and agreed. And the first month’s rent, in advance, as discussed. I am ready to finalize.”

His eyes lit up, but the light was that of a merchant closing a safe, predictable sale, not a believer seeing a bold vision realized. “Excellent! Most efficient.” He took the papers, his fingers brushing hers for a second. His grip, when he briefly took her hand in a gesture of congratulation, was tight, a little damp. He cleared his throat, a soft, rumbling sound. “I must say, Miss Holmes, I’ve been quite impressed by the… vision in your correspondence.” He means ‘baffled by your audacity.’ “A female detective agency,” he continued, savouring the phrase as if it were a peculiar foreign dish, “is a most novel idea.” A polite synonym for ‘preposterous.’ “It speaks to a modern spirit. And from our conversations, I believe you have the tenacity to make something of it.” For a given, very limited, definition of ‘something.’ A quiet, contained little endeavour that perhaps helps locate lost pets or wayward servants, and which fails without causing me any inconvenience or embarrassment.

Miss Holmes allowed a smile, a precise, calibrated movement of her lips that involved only the lower part of her face, leaving her watchful grey eyes unchanged. She felt the surge of her own confidence, a solid, warm stone in her chest, but it was met by the cool, thick wall of his unspoken condescension. The air between them seemed to vibrate with the disparity.

“Thank you, Mr. Thompson.” Your doubt is the fuel. Your expectation of my failure is the obstacle I most relish. “I appreciate your willingness to facilitate this venture.” The space you are leasing to me, and the legitimacy your signature, however reluctantly given, provides.

The formal handshake was repeated across the desk, firmer on her part this time. She felt the callus on his middle finger—the penman’s callus—and the slight, arthritic thickening of the knuckle on his index finger. Gout. He enjoys his port more than is wise. He took the envelope, slit it open with a silver paperknife, and counted the notes with practised, rustling efficiency. His fingers lingered on them a moment too long, the crisp paper whispering.

He’s calculating the risk, she deduced, watching the minute shift in his jaw muscle. Weighing the certainty of this rent against the potential, future scandal of a woman meddling in crime, poking into affairs that are not her concern. He finds the rent heavier, more tangible. For now, the balance tips in my favour.

“All in order,” he announced, the notes disappearing into a drawer that closed with a solid, satisfying thunk. He uncapped a fountain pen, the nib gleaming. “Now, just the formalities.” His voice shifted into a comfortable, sonorous drone as he discussed the terms, pointing with the pen at clauses about covenants, quiet enjoyment, and the prohibition of noxious trades. He spoke of fire insurance and the responsibility for window cleaning. It was a liturgy of the mundane, a deliberate grounding of her extraordinary dream in the dust of plumbing and rates.

She listened, nodding at appropriate intervals, but her mind was elsewhere. She couldn’t help but feel a sense of accomplishment, but it was a quiet, fierce, and terribly private thing. It was not the triumphant fanfare he might have offered a male client launching a business. It was a small, bright flame, carefully shielded from the dampening politeness of the room. This moment, for him, was a minor administrative task. For her, it was a watershed.

As his pen scratched the final, flourishing signature next to her own neat script, she felt not a door opening, but one closing firmly behind her. It locked out a world of expectation, of prescribed paths, of being an observer in the grand theatre of London life. And it opened onto a narrow, dimly-lit, and utterly uncharted hall of her own making. The air in that hall smelled of dust and potential, and it was hers alone to breathe.

He sanded the signature, blew the grains away, and handed her copy of the lease across the desk. “There you are, Miss Holmes. The keys are at the premises with Mr. Higgins. I wish you… the very best of luck.” The pause before ‘luck’ was infinitesimal, but she heard it. He did not say ‘success.’ He wished her luck, the province of gamblers and fools.

She took the document, the paper warm from his desk. “Thank you, Mr. Thompson. I shall require no luck.” She met his gaze squarely, allowing a glimmer of the steel within to show, just for an instant. “Only facts. And those, I find, are generally obtainable.”

A flicker of something—surprise, perhaps, or the faintest recognition of a miscalculation—passed behind his eyes. It was gone in a heartbeat, replaced by the professional glaze. “Quite. Well, good day to you.”

“Good day.”

She rose, turned, and walked from the office, the signed lease in her portmanteau feeling not like paper, but like a title deed to a new continent. The silent lobby, the hushed stairs, the heavy front door—she passed through them all as through a veil. When she emerged onto the street, the cacophony of London rushed back in a wave, but it sounded different now. It was no longer a chaotic roar, but a symphony of clues, of stories, of hidden lives waiting to be read.

She hailed a cab. “Gower Street, please. Number 27.”

As the cab pulled into the traffic, she looked out at the passing city, her city, with new eyes. The game was indeed afoot. And for the first time, she was not merely a player on another’s board. She had built the table. She had written the rules. The first move, the securing of the field, was complete. The next move awaited. She leaned back, a slow, deliberate smile touching her lips, unseen by anyone in the teeming world outside. The work could now begin.
