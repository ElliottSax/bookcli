Chapter 7: The Suffragette's Secret

The rain that pattered against the bay window of 23 Mallowan Crescent was of the peculiarly persistent London variety—not a storm, but a dreary, damp insistence that seeped into the bones of the city and the hems of ladies’ skirts. Inside, however, the parlour office of the Spinster Detective Society was a haven of warmth and quiet industry. A fire crackled in the grate, and the scent of Lapsang Souchong mingled with the comforting aroma of beeswax polish.
Eleanor Swift, seated at the large oak desk they had collectively salvaged and restored, was carefully updating their case ledger. Her pen moved with precise, elegant strokes, a contrast to the chaotic energy of their last investigation involving a purloined parrot and a blackmailing vicar. Across from her, Beatrice “Bea” Khan was frowning at a chessboard, playing both sides of a match against herself, a habit she claimed clarified her thinking. In the window seat, Maggie O’Malley, her spectacles perched on the end of her nose, was utterly absorbed in a thick engineering journal, her fingers twitching as if they itched for a spanner.
The comfortable silence was shattered by the brisk, authoritative knock at the front door—three sharp raps that spoke of urgency barely contained by good breeding.
“I’ll go,” said Bea, rising. “That’s not the post, nor Mrs. Henderson from next door come to borrow sugar.”

She returned a moment later, ushering in a vision of formidable womanhood. Their visitor was perhaps fifty, dressed in a severe but beautifully tailored suit of deep violet wool. Her hair, streaked with silver, was swept into an impeccable coiffure beneath a neat hat, but it was her eyes that commanded attention—a piercing hazel, alight with an intelligence and a fatigue that seemed decades old. She carried herself with the erect posture of a soldier, and a faint, lingering scent of printer’s ink and chalk dust clung to her.
“Ladies,” she said, her voice a rich contralto. “My name is Mrs. Cordelia Thorne. I was given your direction by a mutual acquaintance, Lady Agatha Finch. She assures me you are both discreet and effective.”

Eleanor stood, gesturing to the armchair by the fire. “Please, Mrs. Thorne, do sit. May we offer you tea? You look as though you have walked some distance in this weather.”

“Tea would be welcome, thank you. And I have walked from our headquarters in Bayswater. One finds the rain conducive to thought, if not to dry footwear.” Mrs. Thorne sat, unbending only slightly, her gloved hands clasping a worn leather portfolio on her lap.
Maggie set aside her journal, her curiosity piqued. Bea resumed her seat, her playful demeanour replaced by one of keen assessment. Eleanor poured the tea, the simple ritual a prelude to confidence.
“How may the Spinster Detective Society assist you, Mrs. Thorne?” Eleanor asked, passing a cup.
Mrs. Thorne took a steadying sip before placing the cup carefully on the saucer. “I am the chairwoman of the Bloomsbury Chapter of the Women’s Social and Political Union. For the past eighteen months, we have been planning our most significant, most coordinated campaign to date. It involves not just demonstrations, but a national series of lectures, targeted lobbying of sympathetic MPs, and a publishing endeavour that will, we hope, shift public opinion in a tangible way. The details are known only to myself and my six most trusted lieutenants.”

She paused, the firelight catching the grim set of her mouth. “And yet, for the past three months, we have been consistently thwarted. Printing presses booked for our pamphlets are ‘unavailable.’ Meeting halls we have secured for lectures are cancelled at the last moment under dubious pretexts. Two of our most promising young speakers were arrested on spurious charges before they could take the stage in Manchester. Most damningly, confidential letters between myself and a sympathetic member of Parliament were intercepted and published in a scurrilous newspaper, painting our cause as one of hysterical conspiracy.”

The weight of her frustration filled the room. Maggie leaned forward. “You believe there is a informant within your inner circle.”

“I am certain of it,” Mrs. Thorne stated flatly. “The pattern is unmistakable. Someone with intimate knowledge of our plans is betraying us. They are not merely leaking information; they are orchestrating our failures. This mole is methodically dismantling our campaign from the inside. Our funds are draining, our morale is fracturing, and if this continues, our chapter will be rendered impotent on the eve of our most crucial fight.”

Bea’s brow furrowed. “What is the aim of this person, do you suppose? To destroy the chapter entirely? Or to redirect the movement?”

“That is the question that haunts me,” Mrs. Thorne admitted, a crack appearing in her formidable composure. “Is it an agent of the opposition, planted to subvert us? A rival faction within the broader movement seeking to discredit my leadership? Or…” she hesitated, “or is it one of my dearest friends, whose convictions have wavered, or who has been compromised in some way? The not-knowing is a poison. It turns every whispered conversation, every shared glance, into a potential betrayal. We cannot function, let alone fight for the vote, under this shadow.”

Eleanor profound pang of sympathy. This was not a mystery of stolen jewels or forged wills; it was a corrosion of trust, the very bedrock of a cause built on solidarity. “You wish us to identify the mole.”

“With the utmost discretion,” Mrs. Thorne implored. “No one can know you are investigating. I have told my circle I am engaging a firm to review our security protocols—a half-truth. You will be introduced as such. You must observe, listen, and deduce. The future of our work, I believe, depends upon it.”

The three women exchanged a look. In it was a silent conversation, a weighing of their skills against the complexity of the task. Maggie’s technical mind could discern patterns in logistics; Bea’s social intuition could move through the undercurrents of personal relationships; Eleanor’s strategic thinking could see the larger game.
“We accept,” Eleanor replied, her voice firm. “Your cause is just, and the violation you describe is abhorrent. We will help you root out this betrayal.”

Relief softened the lines on Mrs. Thorne’s face. “Thank you. There is a meeting tomorrow evening at our headquarters. I will introduce you there. The atmosphere will be… charged. Suspicion has made us all a little brittle.”

After Mrs. Thorne had departed, leaving behind her portfolio of carefully redacted schedules and a list of the six suspects, the society gathered around Eleanor’s desk.
“Right then,” said Maggie, peering at the list. “Six lieutenants. We need to get to know a battlefield we’ve never set foot on.”

“It’s a world of its own,” Bea mused. “Alliances, ideologies, passions running higher than a May Ball. The personal and the political are inextricably linked.”

“Our advantage,” Elean answered, “is that we are outsiders. We have no prior loyalties, no history with any of them. We see only the evidence before us.” She laid out the list. “We shall divide the observations. Maggie, you will focus on the practicalities—communications, logistics, who has access to what. Bea, you are our social seismograph. Listen to what is said, and more importantly, what is not. I will engage with Mrs. Thorne and try to grasp the broader strategy, to see whose actions might benefit from its collapse.”

Bea grinned, a spark of excitement in her eyes. “An infiltration. I shall have to choose my hat with particular care.”

The Bloomsbury WSPU headquarters was a hive of purposeful chaos, housed in a tall, narrow building that appeared to vibrate with contained energy. The following evening, the Spinster Detective Society entered, introduced by Mrs. Thorne as “consultants from Sterling & Swift, here to advise on organisational security.”

The large main room was proof of the movement: banners declaring “Deeds Not Words” and “Votes for Women” were draped along the walls, alongside maps of London marked with pins. A long table was strewn with pamphlets, newspapers, and the ever-present scent of ink. A dozen or so women of various ages bustled about, their faces etched with determination.
Mrs. Thorne gathered her six lieutenants. Eleanor studied each as they were introduced.
First was Miss Philippa Sterling, the treasurer, a woman with a sharp, accountant’s gaze and an air of impatient efficiency. She wore pince-nez and clutched a ledger as if it were a shield.
Next, Mrs. Lavinia Croft, the head of communications. She was younger, perhaps forty, with a warm, expressive face that seemed made for oratory, but her eyes held a watchful caution.
Then, Dr. Alice Mehta, the group’s physician and a specialist in public health advocacy. She had a calm, steady presence, her hands—capable and clean—resting peacefully on the lapels of her tailored coat.
Miss Harriet Gable was the events coordinator, a whirlwind of a woman with flyaway grey hair and ink-stained cuffs, speaking rapidly about hall bookings and speaker itineraries.
Miss Constance Leigh, the archivist and researcher, was a quiet, pale woman whto recede into the bookshelves, her fingers perpetually dusty from old papers.
Finally, Mrs. Rosalind Sharpe, the legal advisor. She was the most elegantly dressed of them all, in a fashionable grey suit, her demeanour cool, analytical, and slightly detached.
“These ladies will have full access to our operations,” Mrs. Thorne announced, her tone leaving no room for debate. “Please extend them every courtesy. Our survival may depend on shoring up our weaknesses.”

The reaction was a study in controlled tension. Philippa Sterling’s lips tightened, as if the very idea of weakness was an affront. Lavinia Croft offered a polite but strained smile. Dr. Mehta nodded thoughtfully. Harriet Gable barely paused in her frantic note-taking. Constance Leigh glanced up nervously before returning to her papers. Rosalind Sharpe simply arched a fine eyebrow.
The general meeting commenced, and the detectives dispersed. Maggie attached herself to Harriet Gable, asking technical questions about the distribution of materials that soon had the flustered woman showing her the storage closet and the temperamental mimeograph machine. Bea drifted toward Lavinia Croft and a group of younger members, her easy laughter and genuine questions about the slogans on the banners quickly making her a sympathetic listener.
Eleanor stayed near Mrs. Thorne and the more strategic discussion, observing the dynamics. She saw Philippa Sterling challenge a proposed expenditure with razor-sharp logic. She saw Dr. Mehta gently but firmly insist on proper first aid provisions for the upcoming demonstration. She saw Rosalind Sharpe parse the legal language of a new leaflet, her suggestions precise and unemotional.
And she saw the glances. The quick, searching look Lavinia darted toward Philippa when the treasurer mentioned “funding shortfalls.” The way Harriet Gable wilted slightly under Rosalind Sharpe’s cold scrutiny of her logistical plans. The protective, almost maternal, hand Dr. Mehta briefly laid on Constance Leigh’s arm when the archivist became flustered by a question.
It was Constance Leigh who intrigued Eleanor the most. While the others projected strength—whether efficient, passionate, or intellectual—Constance seemed made of gossamer and anxiety. She jumped at sudden noises, her answers were mumbled, and she seemed most at peace when hidden behind a fortress of file boxes.
During a lull, Eleanor approached her corner. “Your collection is remarkable, Miss Leigh. The history of the movement must be in these pages.”

Constance looked up, startled, like a bird discovered in its nest. “Oh! Yes. It’s… it’s vital. To remember. To learn from what’s come before. So many sacrifices.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “So many letters, diaries… the personal cost. It’s all here.”

“It must be a heavy responsibility,” Emurmuredor said softly.
Tears shimmered briefly in Constance’s eyes. “You cannot imagine. Sometimes the weight of all these stories… and to think someone now is betraying the new ones as they’re being written…” She stopped herself, shaking her head. “I’m sorry. I speak out of turn.”

Later, as they prepared to leave, Bea managed to secure an invitation to a smaller, social gathering at Lavinia Croft’s flat in two days’ time. “A few of us, simply to talk more freely,” Lavinia had said, her eyes including Bea in a circle of implied confidence.
Back at Mallowan Crescent, over a late supper of rabbit pie, they compared notes.
“Harriet Gable is overworked, under-appreciated, and terrified of making a mistake,” Maggie reported. “She has access to every venue booking and travel schedule. She’s also hopelessly disorganised. Her desk is a monument to chaos. Anyone could have rifled through it.”

“Lavinia Croft is passionately devoted, but she’s scwhispered,” Bea said. “She speaks in glorious rhetoric about the cause, but there’s a private fear there. She mentioned twice how ‘ruinous’ a scandal would be for the movement. I suspect she has more to lose personally than the others.”

“Rosalind Sharpe is the opposite,” Eleanor added. “All cool calculation. She views the cause as a legal puzzle to be solved. I cannot discern her personal investment, which makes her motives opaque. Dr. Mehta is the group’s conscience and stabilising force. Philippa Sterling is its iron spine. And Constance Leigh…”

“Yes, the archivist,” Maggie prompted.
“She is emotionally overwhelmed by the history she curates. She feels the betrayals of the past as if they were fresh wounds. If the mole is motivated by a twisted form of protectionism, a belief that the current path is doomed and will only lead to more suffering… she might be a candidate.”

Bea tapped her fork thoughtfully. “Or she is simply a sensitive soul in a brutal fight. We need more than temperament. We need evidence.”

The opportunity came at Lavinia Croft’s flat. The gathering was intimate: Lavinia, Dr. Mehta, Constance Leigh, and Bea, who had brought Eleanor as her “associate.” The atmosphere was more relaxed than headquarters, the tea accompanied by seed cake and less guarded conversation.
Dr. Mehta spoke of her work in the slums, of infant mortality rates that could be halved with better sanitation and the political power for mothers to demand it. Lavinia spoke of her late husband, a progressive journalist who had encouraged her activism. “He always said the pen was mightier than statedsword,” she said, her voice thick. “I sometimes wonder if he’d think my deeds now betray his memory.”

It was a revealing slip. Bea caught Eleanor’s eye.
Constance said little, but she listened intently, her hands twisting in her lap. When Lavinia left the room to fetch more hot water, Dr. Mehta leaned toward Constance. “How is your mother, my dear? The new medication is helping?”

Constance nodded jerkily. “A little. Thank you again, Doctor. The cost… well, we manage.”

“Nonremarkede,” Dr. Mehta said firmly. “Your work here is invaluable. We take care of our own.”

A look of profound guilt passed over Constance’s face so quickly Eleanor almost missed it.
The key clue, however, was discovered not through conversation, but through Maggie’s systematic mind. While the others were at Lavinia’s, she had volunteered to “help tidy the logistical morass” at headquarters with Harriet Gable. As she sorted through a pile of discarded drafts and failed print runs near the mimeograph machine, she found something unusual: not a political pamphlet, but a carefully torn fragment of high-quality, linen-weave paper, the kind used for personal stationery. It was blank but for a single, typewritten letter: “…cannot continue this. The risk is too great, for you most of all. Meet me at the usual place, Sunday, 3 PM. We must end it. – V.”

Maggie pocketed the fragment. That evening, she presented it to the group. “It was in the wastepaper basket by the machine, nearly buried. ‘V.’ The only ‘V’ among the six is Lavinia.”

Eleanor examined the fragment. “The tone is personal, anguished. ‘The risk is too great, for you most of all.’ A lover? A blackmailer?”

“Or a co-conspirator,” Bea said. “Lavinia is afraid of scandal. What if she is being blackmailed into betrayal? ‘We must end it.’”

“Sunday is tomorrow,” Maggie noted. “The ‘usual place’?”

Bea snapped her fingers. “Lavinia mentioned hnotedusband today. She said he proposed to her at the Reading Room of the British Museum. Called it ‘their cathedral of words.’ Could that be it?”

A plan was formed. The next day, Sunday, Eleanor and Bea would position themselves discreetly in the Reading Room. Maggie would remain at headquarters on the pretext of repairing the mimeograph, keeping an eye on the comings and goings.
The British Museum Reading Room was a vast, silent drum of knowledge, its great dome sheltering ranks of earnest readers. Eleanor and Bea, disguised as scholarly spinsters with notebooks, found seats with a view of the main entrance and several aisles. The air hummed with quiet concentration and the smell of old paper.
At five minutes to three, Lavinia Croft entered. She looked pale, her usual warmth replaced by a pinched anxiety. She did not take a reader’s ticket, but stood nervously near the catalogue desks, pretending to examine a volume.
At three o’clock precisely, another figure entered. Not one of the six lieutenants.
It was a man. Well-dressed, in his late forties, with a handsome, careworn face. He went directly to Lavinia. Their interaction was brief and tense. He took her elbow, not roughly but insistently, and guided her toward a secluded row of shelves on the far side of the room.
Bea and Eleanor, with the silent coordination of practice, gathered their things and moved. They positioned themselves in the adjacent aisle, separated by a chest-high shelf of heavy legal folios. They could hear the low, urgent murmur of voices.
“…have to stop, Lavinia. It’s gone too far.” The man’s voice was strained.
“You said the information would only be used to discredit the leadership, to push a more moderate agenda. Not this… this sabotage! Women are being arrested, our work is crumbling!” Lavinia’s whisper was fierce, tearful.
“My editors demand more. The public wants sensation. The story of a movement tearing itself apart sells papers. Your ‘moderate agenda’ isn’t news.”
“You used me.” The betrayal in her voice was palpable. “You used what we had.”
“And you used me for access to the movement’s inner circle when we first met,” he countered, not unkindly, but with a weary truth. “We were both using each other, my dear. But the game has changed. I can’t protect you if this escalates further. They’re starting to look for a mole. If they find you…”
A stifled sob. “I did it for the cause… I thought a different path…”
“You did it for many reasons. But it ends now. This is the last meeting. No more information.”
“And if I refuse? If I confess?”
There was a long pause. “Then I publish everything. Your role. Our… association. The scandal buries the Bloomsbury chapter and you with it. Is that what you want?”
The sound of retreating footsteps. Bea risked a glance. The man was walking away, his shoulders set. Lavinia remained, a hand over her mouth, her body trembling with silent grief and shame.
Eleanor and Bea slipped out before she could notice them. Their hearts were heavy. The mystery was solved, but the victory sour.
They reconvened at Mallowan Crescent with Maggie. The picture was clear, and tragic. Lavinia Croft, the passionate communicator, had been leaking information to a journalist with whom she’d had a romantic entanglement. He had promised to use it to promote a more palatable, moderate faction within the suffrage movement, but had instead sensationalised it for profit, actively engineering the chapter’s failures for better copy. Lavinia, trapped by her own misplaced idealism, guilt, and now by blackmail, had continued.
“We must telreplieds. Thorne,” Maggie said, her practical nature cutting through the melancholy. “The bleeding must be stopped.”

“It will destroy Lavinia,” Bea said quietly. “And it will devastate the chapter. The betrayal came from a place of love, however misguided.”

Eleanor stared into the fire. “We were hired to find the truth. We have found it. How Mrs. Thorne uses it is her decision. But we must present the full context. The blackmail, the manipulation. Lavinia is a victim as much as a perpetrator.”

The following morning, they requested a private audience with Mrs. Thorne at headquarters. They laid out their findings: the fragment of letter, the meeting, the overheard conversation. They presented not just the name, but the tragic narrative.
Cordelia Thorne listened in stony silence. When they finished, she rose and strode to the window, looking out at the grey street. Her formidable frame seemed to der the weight of the revelationansweredLavinia,” she finally said, the word a sigh. “She has the heart of a lioness, but it has always been her vulnerability. She loved her husband so deeply. His loss left a void that made her susceptible to flattery, to the idea of being part of another grand partnership.” She turned, her eyes sharp with pain. “But she betrayed us. She betrayed me.”

“She believed she was serving the cause,” Eleanor offered, though it inadequate.
“There is no cause without trust!” Mrs. Thorne’s voice cracked like a whip. Then, softer, “But you are right. To expose her publicly would be to hand our enemies the weapon they crave. It would shatter us.”

She paced, thinking aloud. “We have our mole. The leaks will stop. We can rebuild, secure in that knowledge. But we cannot keep her in the inner circle.” A resolve hardened in her eyes. “I will speak to her. Alone. She will resign from her position, citing personal reasons. She will be given the chance to make amends in less sensitive, but no less important, work—perhaps fundraising in the provinces. It will be a exile, but not a destruction.”

It was a merciful solution, born of hard-won political wisdom and a lingering affection.
“And the journalist?” Maggie asked.
A grim smile touched Mrs. Thorne’s lips. “I have some information about his own affairs that certain newspaper proprietors would find extremely interesting. I believe he will find his interest in our movement waning considerably. We are not without resources.”

That evening, as the Society shared a quiet glass of sherry, the mood was contemplative.
“It feels unfinished,” Bea said, swirling the amber liquid. “No villain led away in cuffs merely st a broken-hearted woman sent away, and a cad quietly threatened.”

“Real betrayals murmuredoften like that,” Eleanor said. “Messy, human, and steeped in sorrow. We protected the society, and we protected, in a way, the betrayer from utter ruin. It is a messy justice, but it is justice none the less.”

Maggie nodded. “The machine is fixed. The work can continue. That was the objective.”

A knock at the door interrupted them. It was a messenger boy with a small, wrapped package for “The Spinsters.” Inside, on a plain card, was written: “For your discretion, and for seeing the whole woman, not just the crime. With gratitude – C.T.” Nestled in the paper were three beautiful, antique lapel pins, each depicting a tiny, silver key.
“Keys,” Bea said, smiling properly for the first time since the Reading Room. “To unlock mysteries. And perhaps cages.”

They pinned them on, the cool metal a tangible reminder of the complex world they navigated—a world where the lines between villain and victim blurred, where the fight for a better world was sometimes undermined by the very human frailties of those who waged it. The Spinster Detective Society had onlyjust solved a case; they had learned a difficult lesson in the price of principle and the mercy required in a sisterhood under siege. The fire crackled, warding off the damp London night, and in its light, the three silver keys gleamed.
