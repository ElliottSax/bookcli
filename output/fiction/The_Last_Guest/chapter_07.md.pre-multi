Chapter 7: The Wrong Target

CHAPTER SEVEN: THE WRONG TARGET

The storm had finally exhausted itself just before dawn, leaving behind a world of bruised silence. Leo lay rigid in the guest room, listening to the drip-drip-drip of water from the sodden eaves. The argument from the night before played on a loop behind his eyes: Mara’s flinch, Vance’s cold amusement, the way his own accusation—“You’re sleeping with him, aren’t you?”—had hung in the air, stupid and blunt.

Her reply hadn’t been a denial. It had been a deflection, sharp as a scalpel. “You think this is about sex, Leo? You think that’s the currency here?” She’d laughed then, a sound without warmth. “You have no idea what you’ve walked into.”

Then the power had died, plunging them into a blackness so complete it felt solid. The fight was over, smothered by the greater immediacy of darkness. They’d fumbled for candles, the temporary truce more suffocating than the conflict.

Now, in the grey pre-light, a new and more ferocious clarity took hold. It wasn’t about sex. It was about something. And he would find it.

He waited until the silence from the other bedrooms was absolute, a held breath. He slid from the bed, the polished concrete floor icy under his feet. The lodge, usually a symphony of hidden technology, was eerily quiet. No hum of servers, no whisper of climate control. Just the dripping and the creak of his own joints.

Mara’s studio was a separate pod connected to the main lodge by a glass-walled breezeway. The door was, unsurprisingly, locked. But the storm had done its work; a service panel beside the frame, warped by driven rain, yielded to the persistent pry of a butter knife from the kitchen. The click of the latch was a gunshot in the stillness.

Inside, the scent of her hit him first: linseed oil, charcoal, and under it, the sterile tang of acetone. Canvases leaned against the walls, spectral in the gloom. Her workspace was a study in curated chaos—tubes of paint, rags stained like wounds, sketches pinned to a vast corkboard. It looked authentic. It had always looked authentic.

He started with the obvious: drawers of supplies, cabinets of materials. Nothing but the tools of her trade. His heart began to sink, the old narrative of his own paranoia reasserting itself. Maybe he was wrong. Maybe he was just a cuckold after all, a simpler, sadder story.

Then his knuckle rapped against the side of the large, industrial drafting table. The sound was hollow. Not solid wood. He ran his fingers along the sleek edge, finding no seam, no latch. Frustrated, he pushed against it. With a soft hydraulic hiss, the entire top section of the table tilted upward, revealing a shallow, foam-lined compartment.

Neatly nestled inside were three burner phones, still in their packaging, a slim manila folder, and a silver laptop so generic it was conspicuous.

The air left his lungs. The curated chaos was a set. This was the stage.

He took the laptop and the folder to the far side of the room, away from the door, and sat on the floor with his back against a cold concrete wall. He opened the folder first. Financial statements, wire transfer records, all in the name of an LLC he didn’t recognize: Pithos Holdings. The sums were staggering. Inflows from numbered companies, outflows to contractors, to a private security firm, to a forensic psychiatry consultancy. The last item made his skin prickle.

He booted the laptop. It prompted for a password. He tried the obvious: Vance’s name, Mara’s name, variations, dates. Nothing. He stared at the screen, the glow painting his hands blue. Think. What did she value? Not him. Not art. Control. Perfection. The project.

He typed: Phoenix.

The desktop bloomed open.

The background was a default blue. The file structure was brutally organized. One folder, prominently labeled: PROJECT PHOENIX.

He double-clicked. A subfolder list appeared. Background. Financials. Legal. Subject Profile.

His cursor hovered over ‘Subject Profile.’ His mouth was dry. He clicked.

A PDF opened. At the top was a photograph. Not of Vance. It was his own corporate headshot, the one from the Asclepius Pharmaceuticals website. He looked confident, smiling, ignorant. Below it, his full name, date of birth, social security number, educational history, medical records (including his therapy sessions after his father’s death), financial standing, psychological assessments from a company retreat he’d barely remembered.

It was a dossier. His dossier.

The world tilted, the room compressing around him. The sounds of the dripping eaves faded into a high-pitched whine. He was not the hunter. He was the specimen.

With numb fingers, he opened the ‘Background’ folder. The first document was a scanned news article from a trade journal, circa 1998: “Local Inventor’s ‘Data Squeeze’ Fails to Find Market.” There was a small, grainy picture of a man with kind, tired eyes and Leo’s own brow: Robert O’Connor. His father. The article detailed his patent, #6,124,881: “A Redundancy-Based Hierarchical Compression Algorithm.” It was described as clever but obsolete before it left the patent office, made redundant by simpler, faster methods. A footnote in the history of tech.

The next document was a recent technical white paper from a quantum computing institute. Whole sections were highlighted in yellow. His eyes skimmed the jargon: “…quantum coherence…error correction…redundancy matrices…” His father’s name appeared in a citation. The highlighted conclusion stated: “The O’Connor ‘compression’ method, long dismissed, provides an unexpectedly elegant lattice for quantum state stabilization, effectively creating an unbreakable encryption protocol. It is, in essence, the missing key.”

Billions. The word floated off the screen. Not millions. Billions.

Leo’s father had died of a sudden aneurysm when Leo was nineteen. A quiet, defeated man who’d sold insurance after his dream failed, who left behind only a modest house and a stack of unsold prototype boards. He’d never mentioned the patent. He’d certainly never mentioned it being worth anything.

The next PDF was a copy of a legal filing. A “Transfer of Guardianship and Beneficial Interest.” Dated six months before his father’s death. It assigned the patent, in perpetuity, to a trust. The beneficiary of the trust was Leo. The guardian, empowered to manage the asset until the beneficiary could responsibly assume control, was also Leo—but with a stipulation: full control transferred only upon a “demonstration of sustained competency and sound judgment” as determined by the appointed trustee.

The trustee’s name was listed as the law firm of Hartman & Cline. Leo had never heard of them. He’d never been contacted by them. The patent had been a worthless piece of paper; he’d assumed it died with his father. All these years, he’d been sitting on a dormant volcano, and he never felt the heat.

Until someone else had.

He opened the ‘Legal’ folder. The most recent document was a partnership agreement. Parties: Vance Schroder (via Schroder Capital Partners) and Mara Rojas (via Pithos Holdings). Purpose: Joint acquisition and exploitation of Patent #6,124,881 and all associated intellectual property.

The acquisition was not from the open market. It was from the trust.

Clause 12.3 was highlighted in bold red.

Transfer Mechanism: In the event the Beneficiary (Leonard David O’Connor) is deemed mentally or emotionally unfit to manage his own affairs, as certified by two (2) independent, board-certified forensic psychiatrists, guardianship of the trust assets, including all power of sale, shall revert temporarily to the appointed Trustee (Hartman & Cline). The Trustee is hereby authorized and directed, per prior agreement, to execute the sale of said assets to the Partnership for the sum of One Dollar ($1.00), after which the Beneficiary shall be committed to appropriate long-term care, all expenses borne by the Partnership.

Leo read it. Then he read it again. The words swam, then locked into place with a final, terrible click. The project. The dossier. The forensic psychiatry payments. He was the wrong target. He had always been the target. The affair, the jealousy, the isolation here at the lodge—it wasn’t a love triangle. It was a surgical extraction. They weren’t trying to cuckold him. They were trying to certify him insane, to strip him of a birthright he never knew he had, and bury him in a quiet facility while they walked away with a kingdom.
