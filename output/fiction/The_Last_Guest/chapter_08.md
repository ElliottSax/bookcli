 ystem. The cameras. He had to see the cameras.

The footage loaded, a grid of images flickering to life. The boathouse. The Cliffsuite. The main house. The study. Himself, standing frozen in the frame, his face a mask of horror as he stared at the screen.

He rewound. Watched himself walk in, the file in his hands. Watched himself freeze, watched his expression shift from triumph to dawning realization. Watched himself set the file down, walk to the liquor cabinet, pour a drink. Watched himself stand there, staring at nothing, his face a study in controlled panic.

He rewound again. Watched himself enter, the file in his hands. Watched himself walk to the desk, set the file down. Watched himself turn, walk to the liquor cabinet, pour a drink. Watched himself stand there, staring at nothing, his face a study in controlled panic.

He rewound a third time. The same sequence. The same expressions. The same damning evidence.

He leaned back, his fingers steepled. The footage was real. But it was also a lie. A carefully edited lie. He knew how to manipulate video. He knew how to cut, how to loop, how to make a sequence play out exactly as he wanted. But this… this was different. This was a mirror.

He stood, his chair scraping against the hardwood floor. He walked to the window, the storm still raging outside, the waves crashing against the cliffs. He had to think. He had to plan.

He had to escape.

But first, he had to know. He had to know who was watching. Who was pulling the strings.

He turned back to the computer, his fingers flying over the keyboard. He accessed the security system again, this time digging deeper. He found the feed from the cameras in the Cliffsuite. He watched Vance, asleep on the bed, his chest rising and falling in the steady rhythm of drugged sleep.

He rewound. Watched Vance enter the room, watched him sit on the bed, watched him slump, watched him fall asleep.

He rewound again. The same sequence. The same expressions. The same damning evidence.

He leaned back, his fingers steepled. The footage was real. But it was also a lie. A carefully edited lie. He knew how to manipulate video. He knew how to cut, how to loop, how to make a sequence play out exactly as he wanted. But this… this was different. This was a mirror.
