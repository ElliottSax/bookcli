  "genre": "horror",
  "subgenre": "folk horror",
  "premise": "In a remote Appalachian valley, a museum archivist discovers a 'corn dolly'\u2014a traditional harvest effigy\u2014woven from the hair of seven generations of a founding family. When she unties the final, blackened knot to preserve it, she doesn't just release a vengeful agrarian spirit; she breaks a centuries-old pact that required a seasonal sacrifice to keep the soil fertile and the community hidden. Now, the forgotten god of the fallow field is awake, and it will not rest until the valley is returned to its original, wild state\u2014beginning with the descendants who betrayed it.",
  "protagonist": "Elara Vance, a pragmatic city-born archivist specializing in textile preservation, who is struggling with her own family's rural past.",
  "conflict": "Elara must unravel the true, bloody history of the valley and find a way to re-bind the entity before the autumnal equinox, battling both a primordial force that twists nature into grotesque forms and a secretive community that believes a new, modern sacrifice is the only way to restore their prosperity.",
  "setting": "Present-day, in the isolated 'Hollows' of the Appalachian Mountains, specifically during the tense weeks of harvest season as the landscape turns ominously lush and overripe.",
  "tone": "A creeping, atmospheric dread rooted in the corruption of pastoral beauty; the horror grows from the land itself, blending ecological anxiety with the terror of forgotten rituals and the grim price of community survival."
