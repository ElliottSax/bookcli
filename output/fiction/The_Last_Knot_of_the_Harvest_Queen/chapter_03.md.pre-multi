Chapter 3: First Fruits

Chapter 3: First Fruits

Elara woke to a silence so profound it felt like pressure on her eardrums. The usual dawn chorus of sparrows and finches from the museum’s overgrown lilacs was absent. She lay in the narrow bed of the museum’s upstairs flat, the events of the previous night—the untying of the final knot, the sudden, visceral chill—feeling like fragments of a fever dream. Sunlight, weak and watery, strained through the lace curtains. Everything was normal. Too normal.

She dressed quickly, her fingers fumbling with the buttons on her cardigan. The need to see the dolly, to confirm its preservation, was a physical itch between her shoulder blades. She’d left it in her workroom, under a glass cloche on the broad oak table. She padded down the creaking stairs, the museum’s main hall cool and shadowed, smelling of old paper and beeswax polish.

It was the smell that hit her first as she pushed open the workroom door. Not the scent of dust and history, but the thick, cloying sweetness of rot, undercut by something acrid, like ozone after a lightning strike.

The garden outside the large window was dead.

Not autumnal, not fading, but utterly, violently deceased. The museum’s pride—a meticulously maintained heritage plot of heirloom roses, lavender, and medicinal herbs—was a uniform charcoal black. The plants were curled in on themselves, brittle and leached of all colour, as if a wave of superheated air had flash-fried them in the night. No smoke, no fire damage to the window frame. Just instant, absolute blight. Her breath fogged the cold glass.

She turned, her heart a frantic bird against her ribs, to the table.

The glass cloche was there, but it was empty. Beneath it, on the polished wood, lay a small, neat mound of fine grey ash. And arranged in a fan around it, like the petals of a sinister flower, were seven locks of hair. Each was about six inches long, vibrant and pristine: a fiery copper, a wheat-blonde, a raven black, a chestnut brown, a strawberry gold, a silver-grey, and a deep, burnished auburn. They looked freshly cut, impossibly healthy against the dust of whatever the dolly had become.

Elara’s hand flew to her own auburn hair. A cold nausea rose in her throat. She did not touch the glass. She backed away, her hip knocking against a filing cabinet. The silence was no longer peaceful; it was watchful.

The Blackroot Valley Chamber of Commerce meeting, held in the sterile community centre, was in chaos. Elara had come seeking answers, or at least the comfort of shared panic. She found only fractured disbelief.

Harold Gage, a barrel-chested man whose family had farmed the valley’s eastern slopes for three generations, was red-faced, spittle flying. “I’m telling you, the Stellar-Gold! The modified strain! It’s gelatinous! The cobs are leaking a brown sludge that stinks like a backed-up sewer. And it’s not just me. It’s the Jennings’ soy, the Picket’s canola. Overnight!”

Murmurs of agreement, sharp with fear, rippled through the two dozen assembled. These were modern farmers, men and women in branded caps and work boots, people who discussed soil pH sensors and satellite-dictated harvest times. Their prosperity was written in their new trucks parked outside, in the sleek solar arrays on their barns. This was not their language.

“A fungal blight, maybe,” suggested Susan from the Ag Extension office, her voice tight. “Something airborne, moving fast. We need to get samples to the state lab.”

“Fungus doesn’t work like that, Sue,” snapped a younger farmer, Mark. “My entire north forty is pristine at dusk, a bubbling mess at dawn. No spores, no warning. It’s like… like the plant’s own blueprint just unravelled.”

The word ‘unravelled’ hung in the air. Elara felt a prickling on her neck.

The door at the back of the room opened, letting in a slice of cold, damp air. A man slipped in, leaning against the rear wall. He was tall, lean, dressed in worn but clean jeans and a faded flannel shirt over a thermal. His hair was the colour of dark soil, and his face had the weathered, patient look of someone who conversed more with seasons than people. Levi Briarwood. She’d seen his name on a mailbox on her drive in: “Briarwood’s Root & Shoot – Organic Produce.”

While the others argued about lab tests and quarantine zones, Levi remained silent, his arms crossed. His eyes, a quiet, mossy green, met Elara’s across the room. There was no surprise in them. Only a deep, weary recognition that made her feel exposed.

The meeting dissolved into impotent action plans. As people filed out, voices strained with a terror they couldn’t yet name, Elara approached Levi.

“You’re not surprised,” she said, her voice low.

He studied her for a moment, taking in her archivist’s clothes, the subtle shadows under her eyes. “You’re the one from the museum. The keeper of old things.”

“Elara Vance.”

“Levi.” He didn’t offer his hand. “My farm’s on the old family land. The original land.”

“Is your crop… affected?”

A faint, humourless smile touched his lips. “My heirloom corn? The knobbly, colourful stuff that looks ugly next to Stellar-Gold? It’s standing. A bit shocked by the cold, but standing.” He looked past her, out the window at the unnaturally still street. “The valley’s remembering something it was told to forget.”

“Remembering what?”

“The price,” he said simply. He turned to go.

“Wait.” The word burst from her. “Something… something happened at the museum. Last night.”

He paused, his shoulders tense. “You untied it, didn’t you?”

The directness winded her. She could only nod.

He closed his eyes, a brief, pained gesture. “Then the First Fruits are hers. The first taste of what’s to come.” He looked at her, and his gaze was not unkind, but terribly heavy. “You should come see. It’s better than just hearing.”
She followed his old, mud-spattered truck up winding lanes that climbed away from the neat geometric farms of the valley floor. Here, the land grew older, steeper. The hedgerows were wilder, tangled with blackberry and hawthorn. The silence persisted; no birds, not even the rustle of squirrels. It was as if the world was holding its breath.

Levi’s farm was a patchwork of ordered chaos. Neat rows of vibrant vegetables coexisted with wildflower banks and fruit trees. A small, weathered farmhouse sat beside a large polytunnel. It felt alive, in stark contrast to the mortified perfection they’d left behind. Yet even here, the air was cold, and the light had a thin, metallic quality.

He led her past a stand of his heirloom corn, the stalks indeed standing tall, though the leaves were edged with a nervous yellow. “It knows,” Levi said, running a hand over a tassel. “It knows she’s walking.”

“Who?” Elara asked, though a part of her, the part that had felt the ancient, hungry cold from the knot, already knew.

“The Harvest Queen. That’s what the oldest stories called her. Not a queen of bounty. A queen of taking. Of balancing the books.”

They rounded the corner of the polytunnel, and Levi stopped dead.

In the centre of a newly ploughed field, meant for winter squash, stood a scarecrow.

But it was wrong.

The post was the same, the crossbeam the same. Yet the old flannel shirt and overalls were gone. The figure was now meticulously dressed in a shapeless gown made of woven, dried corn husks, bleached pale and gold. Its arms were outstretched, not in a casual hang, but in a formal, rigid pose. And for a head, it did not have a sack or a hat.

It had a pumpkin. A large, Cinderella pumpkin, usually used for pies. But this one was swollen, grotesquely ripe, its perfect orange skin mottled with spreading lesions of black and grey rot. The rot had shaped itself into features: two sunken pits for eyes, a sagging, down-turned gash for a mouth. It was a perfect, monstrous replica of the corn dolly she had untied.

At its feet, in a semi-circle, seven small, ripe pumpkins—each a different variety, from ghostly white to deep green—lay neatly arranged. Each was pristine, unnaturally so.

Elara’s hand flew to her mouth. The dread was no longer creeping; it was a flood, icy and suffocating. The hair. The seven locks of hair. This was a display. A statement.

“She’s remaking the land in her image,” Levi whispered, his voice thick. “Stripping away the false skin. The modified crops, the hybrid grasses… they’re an affront. They have no history here, no pact. So they’re the first to go. Food for her return.”

“And the… the hair?” Elara managed to ask.

Levi’s face was ashen. “The old stories… they said she was a weaver. She wove the fate of the harvest, the fate of the people. She needed threads. Living threads.” He looked at the monstrous effigy, its rotting face seeming to drink the thin daylight. “The dolly was a prison, a knot that bound her. You picked the lock. Now she’s gathering her materials. For the new weaving.”

“We have to destroy that,” Elara said, a surge of desperate defiance cutting through her fear. “Burn it.”

“You think fire will touch that?” Levi nodded toward the scarecrow. “This is her mark. This is the world she sees now. The prosperous valley you drove into? That was the dream. This,” he gestured at the rotting sentinel, at the silent, watchful woods beyond his fields, “this is the waking.”

A gust of wind, the first they’d felt all day, snaked through the field. It did not rustle the corn. Instead, it moaned softly as it passed through the holes in the rotten pumpkin head—a low, hollow sound, like a breath through a distant flute.

The sound seemed to break a spell. From the dark line of the forest at the field’s edge, a crow launched itself into the air. It did not caw. It flew in a frantic, silent spiral, then dove headfirst, with a sickening thump*, into the thick trunk of an oak. It fell to the roots, a broken black rag.

The hook was not a question. It was a fact, planted in the earth before them, rotting and serene. The Harvest Queen was not a metaphor. She was an architect. And she had just begun to draw her plans. The modern world was the parchment, and she was scraping it clean, one screaming, silent field at a time. Elara knew, with a certainty that froze her soul, that the seven locks of hair were not the end of a collection.

They were the beginning of a list.
