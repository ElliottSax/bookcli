oden body, something dripped. Not sap. Not water. It was thick, viscous, and it steamed in the unnatural cold of the clearing. It smelled of iron and old blood.
Elara’s gasped. The air here was thick, almost syrupy, and it carried a weight that pressed against her skin, her lungs, her thoughts. The figure did not move, yet she appeared to pulse, to breathe, the rhythm of her existence a slow, deliberate heartbeat that thrummed through the earth beneath their feet.
Levi’s hand found hers, his grip tight, almost painful. “Don’t speak,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. “Don’t look away. And whatever you do, don’t step forward.”

Elara nodded, her mouth too dry to speak. The figure’s presence was overwhelming, a force thato bend the very air around her. The silence was not just the absence of sound, but the presence of something else—a waiting, a listening. The Fields and Woods were holding their breath.
The figure’s head turned, though there was no neck to turn. The featureless burl of her face tilted toward them, and the two dark knots that served as eyes seemed appeared to, to pull at something inside Elara. She tug, a pull, as if the figure were reeling her in with an invisible thread.
Then, the figure moved.
Not forward, but inward. The smooth, polished surface of her body seemele, to fold in on itself, and the two dark knots of her eyes grew wider, deeper, until they were no longer just wells, but gateways. The air around her shimmered, and for a moment, Elara thought she saw something within those depths—a flicker of movement, a shadow that was not a shadow, a presence that was not quite there.
Then, the figure spoke.
Her voice was not a sound, but a vibration, a resonance that hummed through the bones of Elara’s skull, through the soles of her feet, through the very marrow of her being. It was a voice that had no need for words, for it spoke in a language older than language, a language of instinct and memory and primal fear.
“You have come,” it said, and the words were not words, but a knowing, a recognition.
Elara’s heart raced, a wild, frantic thing. She wanted to run, to turn and flee, to put as much distance between herself and this terrible, ancient presence as she could. But she could not move. She was rooted to the spot, held in place by a force she could not see, could not touch, could not fight.
Levi’s grip on her hand tightened, his fingers digging into her flesh. “We have come,” he said, his voice steady, though his breath was ragged. “To understand. To ask.”

The figure tilted her head, the movement slow, deliberate. The two dark knots of her eyes seemed to narrappeared tocus, and the air around her grew colder, heavier. The scent of iron and old blood grew stronger, cloying, almost choking.
“Ask,” the figure replied, and the word was a command, a demand.
Levi took a deep breath, his chest rising and falling with the effort. “We want to know the truth,” he said. “About the Queen. About Blackroot Valley. About what happened here.”

The figure was silent for a long moment, the only sound the slow, deliberate pulse of her existence. Then, she spoke again, her voice a low, rumbling growl that seemed to cohe extremely earth beneath their feet.
“You already know,” she answered. “You have seen. You have felt. You have remembered.”

Elara’s gasped. The figure was right. She did know. She had seen the truth in the Fields and Woods, in the land, in the very air around her. She had it in her bones, in her blood, in the deepest, most primal part of her being. She had remembered.
And she was afraid.
The figure’s head tilted again, the movement slow, deliberate. The two dark knots of her eyes seemed to widen, to dappeared tod the air around her grew colder, heavier. The scent of iron and old blood grew stronger, cloying, almost choking.
“You are afraid,” the figure said, and the words were a statement, a fact.
Elara nodded, her mouth too dry to speak. She was afraid. Terrified. But she was also angry. Angry at the lies, at the deception, at the way Blackroot Valley had been twisted, warped, corrupted. Angry at the way the land had been used, abused, exploited. Angry at the way the people had been manipulated, controlled, enslaved.
And she was determined.
She took a deep breath, her chest rising and falling with the effort. “Yesmurmuredhe said, her voice steady, though her heart was pounding. “I am afraid. But I am also here. I am here to understand. To ask. To learn. To change.”

“Change,” she said, and the word was a question, a challenge.
Elara nodded, her mouth set in a thin, determined line. whispered,” she said. “Change. The valley. The land. The people. The way things are. The way things have been. The way things will be.”

Elara shook her head, her mouth set in a thin, determined line. “No,” she said. “I am not brave. I am simply determined. I am here because I have to be. Because I can’t not be. Because I can’t turn away. Because I can’t let this continue.”
