 ble nod. “Very well. I will step down from the bench and answer your questions.” He rose, removing his robe and hanging it over the back of the judge’s chair. He wore a crisp, black suit beneath, the fabric so fine it seemed to drink in the light. He took the witness stand, his movements deliberate, almost theatrical. “I am ready.”

Elara took a deep breath, her mind racing. This was her chance. She had to make it count. “Alistair P. Thorne, you’ve spoken of ‘judicial purification.’ What exactly does that mean?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s lips curled into a faint, knowing smile. “It means the removal of impurities from the system. The law is a living thing, and like all living things, it requires pruning to thrive. There are those who would corrupt it, who would use it as a tool for their own gain. I have dedicated my life to ensuring that does not happen.”

“And how do you determine who is an ‘impurity’?” Elara pressed, her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins.

“By their actions,” Alistair P. Thorne replied, his tone calm, measured. “By their intentions. The law is not a blindfolded woman with scales. It is a sword, and it must be wielded with precision and purpose.”

“And who decides who wields that sword?” Elara challenged, her eyes narrowing. “Who decides who is worthy of justice and who is not?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s smile widened, a predator’s grin. “I do. And those who understand the true nature of justice. The system is flawed, Elara. It is slow, it is inefficient, and it is easily manipulated by those with power and influence. I have taken it upon myself to correct those flaws, to ensure that justice is served, not delayed or denied.”

“And what gives you the right to decide who lives and who dies?” Elara demanded, her voice rising with the intensity of her emotions. “What gives you the right to play god?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s expression darkened, his eyes hardening like flint. “The same right that gives any man the authority to defend his home, his family, his legacy. The right to protect what is sacred. The right to ensure that the world remains in balance.”

“Balance?” Elara scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. “You call murder balance? You call corruption balance? You call the destruction of lives and families balance?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s voice was a low growl, a warning. “You do not understand the sacrifices that must be made. The greater good requires difficult choices. The law is not a toy, Elara. It is a weapon, and it must be used with ruthless efficiency.”

“And what about the people you’ve hurt?” Elara shot back, her voice trembling with barely contained fury. “What about the families you’ve destroyed? The lives you’ve ruined? The children who will never know their parents because of your so-called ‘justice’?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s eyes flickered with something—regret? Doubt?—but it was gone in an instant, replaced by the cold, unyielding mask of authority. “Collateral damage. Necessary sacrifices for the greater good. The world is not a fair place, Elara. It never has been. But it can be just. And that is what I strive for.”

Elara’s heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing as she searched for a way to break through his armor. She had to make him see, had to make him understand the monstrosity of his actions. “And what about me?” she asked, her voice softening, almost pleading. “What about the daughter you raised, the woman you claimed to love? What about the trust you betrayed, the love you destroyed?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s expression softened, a flicker of something almost human crossing his face. “You were always my greatest failure, Elara. I tried to raise you to understand, to see the world as it truly is. But you were too weak, too soft. You could not bear the weight of the truth. And so, I had to make the difficult choice. I had to protect you from yourself, from the darkness that would consume you if you continued down this path.”

“Protect me?” Elara’s voice was a whisper, a shattered thing. “By locking me up? By threatening me? By trying to kill me?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s eyes were cold, unyielding. “If that is what it takes. The world is a dangerous place, Elara. And I will do whatever it takes to keep you safe, even if it means keeping you from the truth.”

Elara’s heart ached, a physical pain that radiated through her chest. She had to make him see, had to make him understand. “You don’t love me,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “You never did. You love power. You love control. And you will destroy anyone who stands in your way, even your own family.”

Alistair P. Thorne’s expression was unreadable, a mask of cold, unyielding authority. “I love justice. And I will do whatever it takes to ensure that it prevails. Even if it means sacrificing those I care about. Even if it means sacrificing you.”

Elara’s heart shattered, a thousand pieces of ice and fire. She had to make him see, had to make him understand. But she knew, deep down, that it was too late. The damage was done. The lines had been drawn. And there was no going back.

She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what she had to do. “Then I have no choice,” she said, her voice steady, resolute. “I have to stop you. No matter what it takes.”

Alistair P. Thorne’s eyes narrowed, a flicker of something—anger? Fear?—crossing his face. “You cannot stop me, Elara. I am the law. I am justice. And I will prevail.”

Elara’s heart pounded in her chest, her mind racing as she searched for a way to break through his armor. She had to make him see, had to make him understand the monstrosity of his actions. “And what about me?” she asked, her voice softening, almost pleading. “What about the daughter you raised, the woman you claimed to love?

The air in the courtroom was thick with tension, a palpable force that pressed against Elara’s skin. She could feel the weight of Alistair P. Thorne’s gaze, the cold, unyielding authority that radiated from him like a physical presence. She knew she was outmatched, outmaneuvered. But she also knew that she could not back down. Not now. Not ever.
