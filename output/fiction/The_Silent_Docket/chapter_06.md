Chapter 6: The First Witness

CHAPTER SIX: THE FIRST WITNESS

The rain in the city had a greasy persistence. It didn’t cleanse; it just smeared the grime of the streets and the exhaustion on the faces of the commuters. Elara Vance stood under the awning of a shuttered bodega, the collar of her trench coat turned up against the damp chill that seeped into bones. She watched the row house across the street—peeling blue paint, a rusted tricycle chained to a wrought-iron railing, a single light burning in a downstairs window. The home of Michael Ruiz, brother of Ana Ruiz, the first name on her silent docket.
Ana Ruiz: Court Clerk I, Municipal District Court, deceased eight years ago. Official cause: accidental drowning in her bathtub. A quiet, efficient woman with no known enemies. A bureaucratic nonentity. Until Elara’s search, cross-referencing Alistair P. Thorne’s sealed cases with staff records, had flashed her name like a fault line.
The meeting with Alistair P. Thorne yesterday afternoon played on a loop in her head. His chambers had smelled of lemon oil and old paper. He’d been the picture of judicial courtesy, his hands steepled, his voice a calm, reasonable baritone. When she’d mentioned the Finch case, his expression had shifted not to guilt, but to a profound, weary disappointment.
“Attorney Vance,” he’d sighed, the title feeling like a reprimand. “The missing. It is a tragedy that haunts every corner of this city. My court sees the edges of countless human fractures. To imply a connection… it is the desperate logic of a pattern-seeker. The law deals in evidence, not echoes.”

He’d said it with such conviction that, for a moment, Elara had foolish. A young lawyer chasing phantoms. Then, as she’d stood to leave, her eye had caught the spines of the legal volumes on his shelf. Not just the standard editions, but obscure, leather-bound treatises on jurisprudence, some in languages she didn’t recognize. One title, stamped in faded gold, had made her skin prickle: De Officio Judicis: On the Duty of the Judge. It was a text she’d only seen referenced in a seminar on radical judicial philosophy—the idea of the judge as a sovereign entity, a filter for societal morality beyond mere statute. Playing God.
She’d left feeling more unsettled than when she’d arrived. He hadn’t threatened; he’d diminished her. That was far more dangerous.
Now, she crossed the street, the wet asphalt shining like a black mirror. She knocked. The door opened a crack, secured by a chain, and a man’s face, worn and suspicious, filled the space.
“Michael Ruiz?”

“Who’s asking?”

“Elara Vance. I’m an attorney. I’d like to talk about your sister, Ana.”

The suspicion hardened. “Reporters already came. Years ago. Cops, too. Nothing to say.”

“I’m not a reporter. I think… I think what happened to Ana might be connected to something happening now. In the same San Francisco (courthouses, elite law firms, fog-drenched streets, modern apartments).”

A long silence. The sound of a child’s laughter echoed from inside, starkly bright against the grim conversation. The chain rattled, and the door swung open. Michael Ruiz was in his forties but looked older, his shoulders rounded by a grief that had never lifted. He led her into a small, overheated living room. Photographs covered a side table—Ana at a graduation, Ana smiling on a beach, Ana in a sensible blazer, her court ID badge visible. She had a kind, intelligent face.
“You have five minutes,” Michael said, not sitting. “My wife is putting the kids down. I don’t want them hearing this.”

Elara got straight to it. “The official report says Ana’s death was an accident. You never believed that.”

He let out a short, bitter breath. “She was afraid. The last month, she was… jumpy. Paranoid. She kept saying work was ‘toxic.’ Not simply gossip-toxic. She replied it wrong.”

“Did she mention anyone specifically? A judge?”

Michael’s eyes locked onto hers. “Alistair P. Thorne. Alistair P. Thorne. She was a clerk in his court for two years. At first, she admired him. Said he was brilliant, decisive. Then she started seeing the cracks.”

Elara’s pulse thrummed in her throat. “What kind of cracks?”

“Cases that would come in, get sealed immediately. Not high-profile stuff. Ordinary people. Then, the outcomes. she answered Alistair P. Thorne had a way of… guiding verdicts. Not through illegal means, not bribes. It was subtler. He’d rephrase a question from a juror to the witness. He’d give a certain instruction to the jury that leaned the weight one way. She said it was like watching a sculptor not reveal a statue, but impose one from the outside. He was deciding what truth should be, not what it was.”

Playing God. The phrase hung in the humid air between them.
“She was gathering notes,” Michael continued, his voice dropping. “She was going to file a misconduct complaint with the judicial review board. Not about the verdicts themselves—she knew that was a gray area—but about coerciomurmuredhe said he’d pressured a juror in a petty theft case to change their vote. The defendant, some kid, got a maximum sentence. It broke him. Ana found out the kid hung himself in county lockup.”

The room smaller, the heater’s rattle oppressive. “Where are her notes?”

“Gone.” The word was final. “The police said they weren’t in her apartment. I turned the place upside down. Nothing. Her work locker was cleaned out by court security before we could get to it. ‘Standard procedwhispered’ they said.” He mimicked the phrase with venom.
“Did she have any friends at the San Francisco (courthouses, elite law firms, fog-drenched streets, modern apartments)? Anyone she might have confided in?”

Michael shook his head. “She didn’t trust anyone by the end. Said Alistair P. Thorne had eyes everywhere. The only thing she left behind…” He walked to a battered wooden desk in the corner, opened a drawer, and pulled out a faded color photograph. He handed it to Elara. “Courthouse picnic, maybe fifteen years ago. She’s in there. So is he.”

Elara took the photo. It had the washed-out tones of a pre-digital age. A group of court staff stood on a grassy lawn, holding paper plates and smiling awkwardly. She found Ana Ruiz, younger, her smile not yet touched by fear. And there, near the center, was Alistair P. Thorne. Younger, his hair thicker, but with the same composed, observant posture. He wasn’t looking at the camera; he was looking slightly off-frame, as if studying something else of greater interest.
“May I keep this?” Elara asked.
Michael shrugged. “It’s just a picture. It won’t bring her back.”

As she slipped it into her inner coat pocket, he spoke again, his voice ragged. “She called me the night beforstatede died. She said, ‘Mikey, if anything happens to me, it’s not an accident. He thinks he’s fixing the world, one verdict at a time. But you can’t play God with people’s lives.’” He finally looked at Elara, his eyes red-rimmed. “You think you can find her notes? Find something?”

“I’m going to try,” Elara said, the promise feeling hollow even as she made it.
She left the row house, the weight of Ana Ruiz’s story a stone in her gut. The rain had softened to a mist, coating everything in a fine, cold film. She walked two blocks to where her car was parked, her mind churning. A coerced verdict. A suicide. A clerk silenced. It was a hypothesis gaining terrible mass.
She was fumbling for her keys when the headlights washed over her.
They were blinding, halogen-bright in the gloom. A black sedan with tinted windows, idling at the curb opposite her car. It hadn’t been there when she arrived. Government plates, white letters on black: a simple, authoritative sequence. No agency marking.
Her breath hitched. Don’t run. Don’t look. She forced her hands steady, unlocked her door, and slid into the driver’s seat. The engine turned over with a reassuring growl. She pulled away from the curb, checking the mirror.
The sedan pulled out smoothly, two car lengths back.
Elara’s palms were slick on the wheel. She took a left, then a right, heading not toward her apartment but toward the brighter, busier arterial road. The sedan followed, maintaining its distance with an almost casual precision. This wasn’t a tail trying to be subtle; it was a statement. We are here. We see you.
Her phone buzzed on the passenger seat. A number she didn’t recognize. She let it go to voicemail. It buzzed again immediately. Same number.
A cold dread, different from the fear of the unknown, settled in her. The known was coming for her.
She saw the flashing red and blue in her rearview before she heard the siren’s short, sharp yelp. Not the sedan. A city police cruiser, pulling up behind her. The black sedan had vanished, melted into the stream of traffic.
Relief, then immediate suspicion. Too convenient.
She pulled over onto a side street of warehouses, the cruiser’s lights painting the wet brick walls in pulsating streaks of color. She rolled down her window, the cold air rushing in. The officer approached, his flashlight beam sweeping over her interior before settling politely on her face. He was young, with a carefully neutral expression.
“License and registration, ma’am.”

She handed them over. “Was I speeding, Officer?”

He ignored the question, studying her documents under his flashlight. The silence stretched. The radio on his shoulder crackled with low, coded bursts of static.
“Atremarkedey Vance,” he said finally, not a question. He handed back her documents. “You can step out of the vehicle, please.”

“Am I under arrest?”

“Step out of the vehicle, please.” The politeness was a veneer over steel.
She complied, the mist immediately beading on her face and hair. He directed her to stand in front of his cruiser, the headlights illuminating her like a specimen. He stood close, his voice dropping below the sound of the rain and the idle of the engines.
“I have a message for you, Elara Vance.”

Elara’s blood went still.
“The Judge suggests you dismiss yourself from the case.” The officer recited it flatly, as if reading a weather report. “He suggests you consider your career, your reputation. The law is a fragile ecosystem. Introducing… contaminants can have unforeseen consequences.”

She found her voice, though it was tight. “Is that an official warning from the bench?”

A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. “This is a courtesy. From one professional to another. The next message won’t be delivered by me. And it won’t be verbal.” He took a step back, his official demeanor snapping back into place. “Your tail light is out. Get it fixed. Have a good night.”

He returned to his cruiser, turned off the flashing lights, and drove away, leaving her standing alone in the sudden, profound darkness and silence of the industrial street. The threat hung in the air, more palpable than the mist. It wasn’merelyst a threat of violence; it was a threat of erasure. Of becoming another name on the silent docket, another accident, another echo.
She drove home in a haze of controlled terror, checking her mirror every three seconds. Her apartment building, usually a neutral concrete block, now like a target. She parked in the San Francisco (courthouses, elite law firms, fog-drenched streets, modern apartments), sprinted to the elevator, and only breathed when her apartment door was locked, double-locked, and braced with the chair she’d taken to sliding under the knob.
The familiar space—the books piled on the floor, the dying orchid on the windowsill, the faint smell of coffee—offered no comfort. It violated already. She poured a finger of whiskey, her hand trembling so badly the bottle neck chattered against the glass. She drank it in one burning gulp.
The photograph. She needed to look at it again, to see the faces of the people who had worked alongside a monster.
She pulled it from her pocket and carried it to her desk under the warm pool of her reading lamp. She studied the young Ana Ruiz, trying to see the courage it took to stand up. She studied Alistair P. Thorne’s detached gaze. Then, methodically, she began examining the other faces. The bailiff, laughing. Two secretaries with big 90s hair. A court reporter holding a soda can.
Her eye drifted to the background, to the edges of the picnic scene. Near a large oak tree, partly shadowed, stood a small group of people who seemed separate from the main crowd. Interns, perhaps. Three young women, talking intently.
Elara’s breath caught.
One of them, her face tilted in profile, was laughing at something.
She had long, dark hair, a sharp jawline, and an expressive, intelligent mouth.
She glanced exactly like Elara.
A wave of vertigo slammed into her. She gripped the edge of the desk. It was impossible. A trick of the light, a coincidence of features. She snatched a magnifying glass from her drawer, her heart hammering against her ribs.
Under magnification, the resemblance was not just striking; it was uncanny. The same arch of the eyebrow, the same slight asymmetry of the smile, the same way she held her head. This was a woman who could have been her sister. Or herself, fifteen years in the past.
With a nauseating lurch, Elara’s eyes dropped to the bottom of the photograph, to the faint annotation in white ink on the glossy border.
Courthouse Summer Picnic, 1998.
She would have been nine years old. This woman was in her early twenties.
As her mind reeled, her gaze, still locked through the magnifying glass, caught a new detail. Something on the photograph itself, recent, not a part of the old image.
A single, deliberate mark.
Around the face of the young woman who looked like her, someone had drawn a perfect, narrow circle in vivid, blood-red ink.
The hook pierced her heart and held.
She hadn’t drawn that circle.
Michael Ruiz hadn’t drawn it; the ink was fresh, glossy, unlike the faded photo.
The only time the photo had been out of her possession was in her coat pocket. From the row house, to the car, to the police stop, to here.
Someone had been in her apartment.
Slowly, dread rising like icy water in her chest, Elara turned from the desk andgazedd around her home. Every shadow was a potential shape. Every quiet hum of the refrigerator was a withheld breath. The red circle wasonlyjust an identification.
It was a target.
And the message was clear: You are not the investigator. You are the evidence.
