 nds. You dismantle it and build a better one.”

The words hung between them, heavy with implication. Elara’s fingers tightened around the stem of her wineglass. The crystal trembled, catching the light like a trapped star. She needed to buy time. The wire was recording, but she had to keep him talking. “And what’s your new mechanism, Alistair P. Thorne? Vigilante justice? A court of one?”

He leaned back, his expression thoughtful. “I prefer to think of it as a… correction. A necessary evolution. The law is a living thing, Elara. It must adapt or die. And sometimes, it must be pruned.”

“Pruned,” she repeated, the word sour on her tongue. “Is that what you call it when you kill a man in his own home? When you leave his wife to find him in the bathtub, his skin peeled back like a glove?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s smile didn’t waver. “Poetic. But inaccurate. The details are messy, aren’t they? The body, the blood, the grief. I prefer to focus on the outcome. A corrupt judge removed from the bench. A cancer excised. The system, though wounded, continues to function.”

Elara’s pulse hammered in her throat. She needed to push harder, to get him to slip. “And what about the collateral damage? The families left behind? The lives you’ve shattered in the name of your so-called justice?”

“Collateral damage is the price of progress,” he said, his voice as smooth as the wine in his glass. “Every surgeon knows this. Every general. Every architect of change. You cannot build a new world without tearing down the old one.”

The air between them crackled with tension. Elara’s mind raced, searching for a way to turn the conversation, to get him to reveal more. She needed to keep him talking, to keep him from suspecting anything. She took a slow, deliberate breath, forcing her voice to remain steady. “And what about you, Alistair P. Thorne? What happens when you’re the one who’s torn down?”

His laughter was soft, almost affectionate. “Ah, Elara. Always the prosecutor. Always looking for the next move. But you see, that’s the beauty of it. There is no next move. There is only the inevitable. The law will catch up to me, eventually. But by then, the damage will be done. The rot will be cut away. The system will be stronger for it.”

Elara’s fingers tightened around the stem of her wineglass. She needed to end this. She needed to get out of here. But she couldn’t leave without the evidence she needed. She took a slow, deep breath, forcing her voice to remain steady. “And what about me, Alistair P. Thorne? What’s my role in all of this?”

His smile was slow, deliberate. “You, Elara, are the wild card. The unpredictable variable. The one who could either bring me down or join me. The choice is yours.”

The words hung in the air between them, heavy with implication. Elara’s mind raced, searching for a way to turn the conversation, to get him to reveal more. She needed to keep him talking, to keep him from suspecting anything. She took a slow, deliberate breath, forcing her voice to remain steady. “And what if I choose to bring you down?”

Alistair P. Thorne’s smile didn’t waver. “Then I suppose you’ll have to try. But be warned, Elara. The game is already in motion. And you’re not the only player.”

The words sent a chill down her spine. She needed to get out of here. She needed to get to Leo. She needed to get the evidence to the DA. But she couldn’t leave without the evidence she needed. She took a slow, deep breath, forcing her voice to remain steady. “And what if I choose to join you?”
