CHAPTER 3: PATTERN RECOGNITION

A permanent rain had settled over the city, a fine, persistent mist coating everything in a greasy sheen. San Francisco’s lines blurred, its marble facades turned into weeping cliff faces. Inside her office high above the slick streets, a damp chill seeped into Elara Vance’s bones. Forty-eight hours had passed since the sealed docket entry in the Finch case appeared, and the anomaly had metastasized from a professional itch into a full-body hum of disquiet.

Her original case file lay open on the desk, a mere prop. Across the secondary monitor and in the chaotic constellation of sticky notes now defacing the pristine glass wall, the real work was spread. At the center was Maya Finch’s smiling face, photocopied from a missing person’s flyer Leo had given her. Around it, Elara had begun mapping the solar system of Alistair P. Thorne.

Known facts formed the starting point: Thorne’s career trajectory, his published opinions—dry, meticulous, leaning toward prosecutorial deference—and his public persona, that of an avuncular, stern pillar of the old guard. But the sealed hearing was a black hole, warping the space around it. A hearing in a missing person’s case wasn’t sealed without reason. National security? Witness protection? For a freelance court reporter from Queens? Nothing fit.

Driven by an inarticulate suspicion, Elara expanded her search. Firm resources accessed deeper judicial archives, bypassing the public-facing systems. The search was no longer for Alistair P. Thorne’s name, but for the silence around it—a hunt for sealed proceedings in his district that correlated with missing persons reports, a process both absurd and terrifyingly logical.

Just after midnight, the first hit arrived, the monitor’s blue light etching lines into her vision.

Case File: Disappearance of Arthur Bell, 48, Court Clerk. Reported: October 18, 2008.

Arthur Bell had vanished on his way home from a late session at the Kings County Supreme Court. His car was found parked neatly near the 4th Street subway station, keys in the ignition, a half-finished cup of coffee gone cold in the cup holder. The investigation had focused on his personal life—gambling debts, a strained marriage—and petered out after six months. A sad, unremarkable tragedy.

Buried in the ancillary court records she’d unearthed, however, was a single line item. A hearing, *In re: Matter of Bell*, held in the chambers of Alistair P. Thorne, November 3, 2008. Status: SEALED. No docket number. No listed attorneys. It existed only as a ghost in the machine, a digital whisper. Arthur Bell had worked in Alistair P. Thorne’s courtroom for five years.

A faint cloud of breath fogged the chilled office air. Coincidence. It had to be. A clerk goes missing, maybe he knew something, maybe they thought it was connected to a case… it could be explained. The sparse, warm-from-the-printer details were pinned to the wall beside Maya Finch. Fifteen years apart.

Sleep proved impossible. Bitter black coffee fueled the night, its acid taste a constant on her tongue. The second hit came as dawn bled a dirty orange into the eastern sky and the city’s lights began to surrender.

Case File: Disappearance of Chloe Durand, 34, Juror. Reported: March 5, 2015.

Chloe Durand had served as the jury foreperson on a high-profile embezzlement trial. A graphic designer, mother of two. The trial ended in a guilty verdict. Three weeks later, after celebrating a friend’s birthday at a wine bar in the West Village, she never made it to her Uber. Her purse was found in a dumpster two blocks away, cash and credit cards untouched. The investigation theorized a botched abduction, but no body, no witnesses, no demands. It went cold.

And there it was again. A hearing, *In re: Matter of Durand*, April 1, 2015. Alistair P. Thorne. SEALED. Chloe Durand had sat in judgment in Alistair P. Thorne’s courtroom for six weeks.

Elara stood up so fast her chair rolled back and slammed into the credenza—a gunshot in the silent office. Three people. A court clerk. A juror. And now, a court reporter. All vanished. Each case followed, within weeks, by a sealed, solitary hearing before the same judge. The air in the room thinned, pressurized. This wasn’t coincidence. This was a pattern, etched in negative space, visible only by the outline of what was missing.

Leo was needed.

He waited in the same shabby diner, hunched over the same Formica table. He looked worse, the hope she’d inadvertently given him now curdled into a sharper anxiety.

“You have something.” His voice held no question. His eyes fixed on her face, reading the tension in her jaw.

“Maybe. I need you to confirm something.” Her voice stayed low, leaning in. The smell of old grease and burnt coffee overwhelmed the space. “You said Maya Finch was a court reporter. Did she ever work in Kings County? Specifically, for Alistair P. Thorne?”

Leo’s face went still. A slow nod followed. “Yeah. Not all the time. Freelancers get assigned all over. But she did jobs there. She mentioned him once or twice. Called him ‘The Sphinx.’ Said he had a face like a tombstone and never cracked a smile.” He swallowed. “Why? What does he have to do with this?”

Elara chose her words with surgical care, aware of stepping over lines. “There’s a procedural anomaly in Maya Finch’s case file. A hearing was held about her disappearance that’s under seal. I can’t access it.”

“A hearing? About her? Who was there? What did they say?” His voice climbed, raw and desperate.

“I don’t know. It’s sealed. But, Leo…” A pause, the moral weight of her next sentence heavy on her tongue. She was no longer acting as his attorney; she was a conspirator. “I’ve been looking. There are two other cases. A court clerk, fifteen years ago. A juror, eight years ago.” They vanished. And after each one, there was a single, sealed hearing before Alistair P. Thorne.”

The color drained from Leo’s face, leaving his skin a pale, clammy sheen.d like he’d been punched in the gut. Elara’s words hung in the air, a challenge to his sanity.

“Why?” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the din of the diner.

Elara’s eyes locked onto his, a deep understanding passing between them. They both knew what she was saying, but neither of them dared to say it out loud.

“Because,” she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper, “I think Alistair P. Thorne is involved in these disappearances. And I think he’s using his court to cover it up.”

The diner’s fluorescent lights seemed to flicker in response, casting an eerie glow over the scene. Leo’s eyes widened, his face a mask of horror.

“Get out,” he whispered, his voice trembling. “Get out of here. Now.”

Elara knew she had to leave. She knew she had to get out of there before Leo changed his mind. She knew she had to get out of there before she was caught.

She stood up, her chair scraping against the floor. She grabbed her bag and turned to leave, but not before catching a glimpse of Leo’s face. It was a face of pure terror, a face of pure despair.

She knew she had to get out of there. She knew she had to get out of there before it was too late.

As she walked out of the diner, the rain seemed to grow heavier, the droplets pounding against her skin like a drumbeat. She knew she had to keep moving, to keep searching for the truth. She knew she had to keep going, no matter what.

The city seemed to stretch out before her, a vast and endless expanse of concrete and steel. She knew she had to move through it, to find her way through the darkness. She knew she had to keep moving, to keep searching for the truth.

And so she walked, her feet pounding against the pavement, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew she had to keep going, no matter what.
