Chapter 2: Beneath the Surface

Chapter 2: Beneath the Surface

The rain had stopped, leaving the city slick and reflective under a bruised evening sky. From her office on the forty-second floor, Elara Vance watched the taillights bleed into long red streaks on the wet asphalt below. The silence up here was expensive, a vacuum sealed by double-paned glass and plush carpet. It was the kind of quiet that should have felt like an achievement. Instead, it felt like waiting.

The Finch file sat open on her desk, a thin, pathetic thing. Ten years of absence didn’t generate much paper. Police reports, cursory and cynical. Interviews with Leo Finch, his answers growing more robotic with each passing year. A few grainy photos of Maya Finch—a woman with a kind, forgettable face, standing in front of a birthday cake, squinting at the sun on a hiking trail. A life reduced to a PDF.

Elara skimmed the documents with the detached efficiency of a pathologist. She was looking for the obvious tumor: a history of domestic calls, financial trouble, a secret lover. The police had looked for the same thing a decade ago and found nothing. Leo Finch was either a saint or a psychopath of immense patience. Her money, cynical and hardened by years of staring into the abyss of human behavior, was on the latter. Pro bono cases were usually lost causes, and lost causes were usually inhabited by guilty people.

She moved to the court docket, the official ledger of the case. It was a digital scroll of bureaucratic minutiae: Motion for Discovery Filed. Status Hearing Scheduled. Order to Continue. The dry heartbeat of a dying inquiry. She scrolled, her eyes glazing over, already drafting the polite, inevitable letter to Leo Finch explaining the lack of actionable avenues.

Then she saw it.

An entry, dated nearly seven weeks after Maya Finch was officially declared missing by the police.

04/17/2013: SEALED MOTION HEARING. Judge A. Thorne presiding. Order entered under seal.

Elara sat back. Her chair gave a soft, leathery sigh. A sealed hearing, in a missing person’s case with no suspect, no body, no evidence of foul play? It made no procedural sense. Sealing was for protecting informants, trade secrets, national security. Not for the vanishing of a mid-level accountant from Queens.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard. She accessed the court’s internal system, her login granting her high-level access as a member of the bar. She entered the case number, clicked on the sealed entry. A spinning wheel appeared. Then a dialog box, stark and final:

ACCESS RESTRICTED. SEALED PER JUDICIAL ORDER 09-45. TO REQUEST UNSEALING, SUBMIT FORM 12-C TO THE CLERK’S OFFICE.

Professional curiosity, a slow, cold drip, began to work its way down her spine. This was an anomaly. Anomalies were knots. And Elara Vance could not abide a knot.

The next morning, the Clerk’s Office of the County Supreme Court smelled of dust, old paper, and human resignation. The fluorescent lights hummed a dirge. Elara, in a tailored charcoal suit that felt like armor, placed a perfect, completed Form 12-C on the counter.

The clerk, a man with the pallor of a root vegetable and eyes that had seen too many desperate faces, didn’t look up. “Reason for request?”

“Professional review. I’m counsel on the case.”

He took the form, stamped it with a force that cracked the quiet, and slid it into a tray labeled ‘PENDING.’ “Judge’s order. These go to chambers for approval. Takes time.”

“How much time?”

He finally met her eyes, his expression flat. “As long as it takes.”

Back at the firm, the pressure to perform for paying clients was a tangible hum. Between conference calls and drafting motions for a hedge fund manager accused of securities fraud, Elara carved out slivers of time. She began to research Judge Alistair Thorne.

The public record was a monument. Columbia Law. Federal clerkship. A meteoric rise in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, known for a conviction rate that bordered on mythical. Appointed to the bench fifteen years ago. His rulings were textbook—lean, precedent-driven, and utterly ruthless. He was known for clearing his docket with terrifying speed. Defense attorneys whispered about him; prosecutors revered him. He was a pillar. Granite.

She found photos: Thorne at bar association dinners, a tall, gaunt man with a blade of a nose and hair the color of iron filings. He never smiled. His eyes, even in pixelated newsprint, were the color of a winter sea. She read quotes from his speeches: “The law is a scalpel, not a cudgel.” “Efficiency is the ally of justice.” “Sentiment has no docket number.”

It was all so pristine. So sterile. It made her teeth ache.

Two days later, her request for the sealed hearing was still ‘pending.’ She called the clerk’s office. The line rang into a void. She sent a polite follow-up email. No response. The silence was no longer bureaucratic; it was deliberate.

At lunch, she met Ben Soriano for a coffee at a cramped spot near the courthouse. Ben was a court reporter, a lifer who knew where every body was buried because he’d transcribed the burial. He had kind, tired eyes and a perpetual stain of ink on his thumb.

“Thorne?” Ben stirred his coffee slowly. “He runs a tight ship. Scares the hell out of the law clerks. They say he reviews midnight filings at 3 a.m. and has corrections waiting by dawn.”

“Anything else?” Elara asked, keeping her tone casual. “Any… quirks?”

Ben looked around, though no one in the noisy shop cared. He leaned in, his voice dropping. “You didn’t hear it from me. But there’s talk. Among the old bailiffs, the secretaries who’ve been there since the marble was laid. They call it his ‘private docket.’”

“Private docket?”

“Cases that get filed, but don’t get a public number. Or they get a number, then vanish. Hearings that aren’t on the public calendar. Always in his chambers. Always just him, a court reporter—not me, one of his chosen—and lawyers who aren’t… chatty afterward.” Ben shrugged. “Probably just urban legend. Courthouses are full of ghosts.”

But Elara didn’t believe in ghosts. She believed in secrets. A private docket. The phrase echoed in the silent chamber of her mind.

That evening, exhausted, she ordered in sushi she didn’t taste. She was about to close her laptop when the notification chimed—a new email.

The sender was a jumble of letters and numbers. The subject line was blank.

The body of the email contained a single sentence, in plain, default font:

Let sleeping dogs lie.

A cold finger traced her vertebrae. She forwarded it to the firm’s IT security head with a note. An hour later, he called. “It’s a ghost. Bounced through a dozen proxy servers, dead ends. Untraceable. You want me to alert anyone?”

She looked out at the dark, glittering city. “No,” she said. “Not yet.”

The warning should have frozen her. It did the opposite. It was a spark on dry tinder. Someone was watching. Someone who knew her curiosity had been piqued. That meant there was something to find.

Professional curiosity was now personal obsession.

She didn’t go through the front door. She went through the basement. An old law school friend, now a harried systems administrator for the city’s court system, owed her a favor bigger than the one she’d called in. It took three days of anxious waiting. Finally, a secure, encrypted link arrived in her personal email, with no message.

Her heart hammered against her ribs as she clicked it. She was in. A back-channel administrative portal, a digital skeleton key. She felt a thrill that was entirely different from winning in court. This was darker. This was the thrill of the trespass.

She navigated to the Finch case. To the sealed entry. Her breath hitched. The ‘Order After Hearing’ was not, as she’d expected, a dense legal document. It was a single paragraph. She read it. Then read it again, the words refusing to cohere into sense.

Upon the ex parte motion of the Office of the United States Attorney, and for reasons set forth in a separate, classified annex, it is hereby ORDERED that all records pertaining to the motion hearing dated April 17, 2013, in the matter of the People v. [REDACTED], be sealed in perpetuity. This sealing is deemed necessary for the preservation of judicial security and the integrity of ongoing federal operations. No further inquiries shall be entertained.

So ordered,
Judge Alistair Thorne

The air left her lungs. People v. [REDACTED]. Not Finch. Not a missing person’s case at all. The hearing had been about something else entirely, something federal, something classified. But it had been logged on Leo and Maya Finch’s docket. A clerical error? Impossible. The system didn’t make mistakes like that. This was a graft, a surgical implant.

Preservation of judicial security.

The phrase was cold, official, and utterly terrifying. What did a federal case, so sensitive it required a secret hearing in a state court, have to do with the disappearance of Maya Finch? And why hide it in her file?

Elara closed the portal, her hands trembling slightly. She looked at the innocent, thin Finch file on her desk. It was no longer a sad story about a vanished woman. It was a door. And behind that door, she could now hear the faint, rhythmic sound of something digging. Not out. In.

Judge Thorne wasn’t just a judge on a case. He was a player. And the game, it seemed, was still being played.

She had a choice. She could walk away. Write the letter, close the file, let the sleeping dog lie. Preserve her career, her reputation, her safe, lucrative life atop the gleaming tower.

Elara Vance looked at the redacted line on her screen, a black bar over the truth. She smelled the ozone of conspiracy, felt the first stirrings of a dread that was older than law. A smile, thin and without warmth, touched her lips.

She picked up the phone. She had a client to see. It was time to ask Leo Finch what he really knew about his wife’s disappearance, and why a federal shadow had fallen across their ordinary lives a decade ago. The superficial review was over. Now, she was going to dig. And she was going to find out what, or who, was buried beneath the surface.
