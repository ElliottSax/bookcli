Chapter 10: The True Procedure

The world was coming apart in the sound of shattering crystal and grinding stone. Alistair’s mind, trained by decades of clinical precision, tried to sort the chaos: the ceiling shed diamond dust, the great roots of the Heart groaned like dying giants, and the air tasted of ozone and grave soil. But all of it faded next to the thing before him.
Kael, the Spirit-Touched man he had sworn to sacrifice, stood transformed. His skin, once the color of dawn mist, was now a bruised, mottled grey, split by jagged black veins that pulsed like faulty arteries. His eyes were pits of tarnished silver, fixed not on Alistair, but on the sick, pulsing core of the Heart. He wasn’t just corrupted; he was a weapon, aimed.
“He’s a conduit!” Lumen’s voice was raw against the noise. She stumbled to Alistair’s side, one hand pressed to a bleeding cut on her temple. “The Gate’s poison… it’s using him to force the final transfusion. If he touches the Heart’s core, it won’t be a healing. It will be an infection that turns this world to stone in an instant.”

Elara appeared from a shower of falling grit, her short sword notched, her breath sharp. “He’s fast. And he doesn’t bleed, he crumbles.” She placed herself between Kael and them, a hopeless, brave move. The cavern shook again; a pillar of crystal broke apart and exploded into razor shards.
Alistair’s hands went to the twin sheaths at his ribs. The scalpels hummed, a feverish vibration against his bones. The final surgery. The thought sat cold in his gut. He had pictured a clean transfer, a willing sacrifice from one being to another. This was emergency medicine on a collapsing battlefield.
“The Transference is wrong,” Alistair said, the words coming out in a rush. He wasn’t speaking to Lumen or Elara, but to the logic of the world, to the cruel math he’d accepted. “It was never about adding life. It’s about removing the sickness.”

Lumen’s good eye widened. “What?”

“Look at it!” Alistair pointed at the Heart. The intricate channels within its crystal were clogged with a thick, black-gold sludge. The light it gave off wasn’t fading from emptiness; it was drowning. “It’s infected. The poison from the Tarnished Gate is here, stuck, trapped. A transfusion from Kael would just feed the fire. The procedure… it’s a cleansing.”

Understanding, then horror, washed over Lumen’s face. “You’d have to pull the poison out. But there’s nowhere for it to go. The waste is solid stone. The air is dead. It would simply gather.”

“Not if it has a conduit,” Alistair said, his voice low and clinical. “A filter. A living one.” He drew the scalpels. In the failing light, they were not silver, but the color of a deep, clear sky. “These aren’t just for cutting. They’re for focusing. For separating.”

Elara looked back, her face pale. “Alistair, no. That’s not redemption, that’s suicide.”

“It’s the procedure,” he replied, and the grim certainty in his voice stopped her. He turned to Lumen. “How do I connect to the core? Not to give, but to pull.”

Lumen stared at him, a conflict in her eyes. She had wanted a savior, a butcher, a priest. She was getting a doctor set on a deadly, untested operation. At last, she cursed and grabbed his wrist. Her fingers were cold and strong. “The core is there,” she pointed to a knot of pulsing, sick light near the base of the great tree. “But you don’t pierce it to give. You have to… match it. Your essence, your will—it has to find the Heart’s original rhythm, under the sickness. One clear note. The scalpels will do the rest. But Alistair…” Her grip tightened. “The moment you start to pull, the poison will have a path. You. It will flood you. Your flesh, your spirit… it will turn to stone from the inside. The pain will be worse than any fire, and you can’t come back from it.”

Another tremor. Kael took a jerky step forward, moving like a puppet. A black, tar-like substance dripped from his fingertips, burning where it hit the stone.
“We’re out of time,” Elara said, raising her sword. “Do your damn surgery, Alistair. We’ll hold him off.”

There were no more words. No grand speeches. Alistair gave a single, sharp nod—the same he’d give a fellow surgeon before a difficult operation. Elara met his eyes, and in her fierce, frightened look, he saw the ghost of the home he might never see again. Then she turned, a soldier facing the wave, and charged at Kael with a rough cry, Lumen at her side with a dagger made of sharpened crystal.
Alistair did not watch. He entered a focused state, his world shrinking to the operating field: the shuddering crystal, the septic core, and the instruments in his hands. The sounds of battle grew faint. He approached the Heart's base, the hum of the scalpels growing louder.
He placed his bare hands against the crystal. It warm, like a feverish brow. Through his fingertips, he sluggish, irregular throb, choked and struggling. He closed his eyes, thinking of the basic principle of healing: do no harm. He thought of making a clean cut, a precise suture, and draining an abscess. He tried to find the song Lumen spoke of.
It was there, faint and buried under years of decay. A single, clear note, like a chime from a long-forgotten world. He focused on it, pouring his will, guilt, and desire to mend into that note.
The resonance started. A vibration traveled up his arms, into his teeth. The crystal under his palms grew brighter, and the black-gold sludge within recoiled from the purity of the tone. The core nexus pulsed, like a sick eye opening to him.
Now, with a measured thrust, he plunged both scalpels into the light.
There was no sound, but the world appeared to scream. The pain was overwhelming. It like his blood was solidifying, turning to grit, then to stone. It rushed up the scalpels, and into his hands.
He watched in horror as his skin turned to stone, starting from his knuckles and moving up his fingers. The feeling changed, becoming a crushing heaviness, a pressure from within. He his body's channels - veins, nerves, and magical pathways - being filled with a dense, invasive substance.
But through the scalpels, he also flow of poison from the Heart's capillaries. It was a vile, torrential river, and he was its new, unwilling channel. He gritted his teeth, already stiffening, and focused on filtering the poison. The blades couldn't stop it, but they could strain it, separating the most virulent particles and forcing it into a single, concentrated stream that burned through him.
Visions assaulted him - the despair of a dying forest, the metallic tang of a corrupted ley line, the shriek of a spirit unraveling into malice. It was the story of a world's illness, written on his soul.
He heard Elara's voice, frayed with pain, and a crash. He couldn't turn his head. The petrification had reached his wrists and was moving up his forearms. The weight was immense, and he was becoming a statue.
He focused on the flow, trying to steady it. He adjusted his grip, a small movement that sent fresh waves of agony into his elbows. The black-gold sludge surged more efficiently. Deep within the Heart, he saw a capillary clear, the crystal around it flickering with a faint, healthy glow. It was working, but he was killing himself.
Kael's body slammed into the crystal beside him, his arm severed and oozing black dust. His eyes were fixed on Alistair, full of hatred. He raised his remaining hand to swipe at Alistair's neck, but a crystal dagger sprouted from his chest. Lumen gave a final shove, and Kael crumbled into a pile of grey powder.
Elara was on her knees, clutching a bleeding side. Lumen dropped down, spent. Alistair had no breath to spare. The petrification was at his shoulders, creeping down his chest and up his neck. The inside of his mouth tasted of chalk and rust. He was clogging, and the purified essence had to go somewhere. He couldn't direct it, only release it.
With a final effort of will, he opened the channel, letting the purified essence flow out. A trickle of green-gold light escaped from the tips of the blackened scalpels and flowed into the ground at his feet. The effect was instantaneous, but brief.
Where the light touched the dead, petrified waste of the cavern floor, life erupted. A carpet of soft, emerald moss spread in a rapid circle. Delicate, white flowers budded, bloomed, and withered in the space of a heartbeat. A tiny, glowing vine spiraled up a cracked root before turning brown and crumbling to dust. It was a memory of life, a ghost of green, flashing across the grey world like lightning illuminating a barren landscape. For one second, the air smelled of rain and fresh soil instead of dust and decay.
Then it was over. The last of the purified essence faded. The moss turned grey and brittle. The cavern was darker, quieter.
The great Heart of the World gave a soft, resonant chime. The light within it was no longer a drowning amber, but a pale, steady silver. Weak, but clean. The sick pressure was gone.
Alistair’s hands fell away from the crystal. The scalpels, now black and pitted, clattered to the stone, sounding like fallen tombstones. He tried to take a step back, but his legs would not obey. He looked down.
From the waist up, he was a man. Pale, sweating, his eyes wide with shock and pain. From the waist down, he was stone. A perfectly detailed statue of himself, fused smoothly to the living flesh above. The grey, petrified flesh was shot through with those same black-gold veins he’d seen in the Heart. They pulsed faintly, a prison of captured corruption. The agony had not stopped; it had settled into a permanent, screaming ache, a deep pressure held in check only by his own turning flesh.
He collapsed, the stone half of him hitting the ground with a terrible, final sound. He could not feel the impact. He could only feel the cold, immense weight of the poison trapped inside him, a toxic well sealed in a tomb of his own making.
Elara crawled to him, her hands fluttering over his stone legs, his still-soft torso. Her tears cut tracks through the grime on her face. “No. No, you idiot. You glorious, stupid idiot.”

Lumen approached, her expression unreadable. She placed a hand on the Heart, then on Alistair’s petrified thigh. “The Heart… it will live. The world’s decline is stopped. The procedure…” She glanced at him, and for the first time, there was something like pity in her gaze. “It worked.”

Alistair tried to speak. His tongue was heavy, but still flesh. “The… poison…”

“Is contained,” Lumen whispered. “Inside you. You hold the world’s sickness now.”

Elara sobbed, a raw, helpless sound.
Then, somewhere in the depths of the earth, or perhaps in a fold of reality itself, a sound echoed through the cavern. It was not a chime, not a groan of stone. It was a deep, metallic, resonant clang.
And with it, a wave of nausea, feelings of vertigo, a whisper of alien air.
Far away, in a place where the boundaries had been worn thin by desperation and corrupted magic, the Tarnished Gate—unbalanced, shaken by the sudden cleansing of the Heart and the concentration of its poison into a single, mortal vessel—flickered. And for the first time in centuries, it shuddered open.
