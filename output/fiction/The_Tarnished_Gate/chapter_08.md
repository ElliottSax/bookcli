Chapter 8: The Oath Broken

The air in the cavern was not still. It pulsed with a slow, sickly rhythm that matched the faint, dying light of the Heart. Alistair stood at the base of the colossal crystalline tree, his boots sinking into a fine, grey powder that had once been living moss. The Heart was no longer beautiful. It was a patient on the table, its great branching veins of amber and rose quartz clogged with black, fibrous growths. A sweet, heavy scent of decay, like overripe fruit and spoiled honey, fought with the sharp, clean smell of the antiseptic oils on his instruments.
The smell of decay clung to his skin, a reminder of every life he had taken in the name of science. His instruments appeared to mock him now, their silvered steel and glass gleaming in the dim light. The Transference needle, a hollow tube of glass and orichalcumto hum with a dark energy, as if it shared his doubts.
They were laid out on a sterile white cloth atop a portable chirurgia table: retractors of silvered steel, clamps, a saw for the worst branches, and the scalpel. It glowed with a soft, captive light, charged with Glimmer taken from a dozen branded heretics in the world above—from sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's own empty apartment. It hummed in his hand, a vibration that traveled up his arm and settled in the hollow of his chest.
“Remember, Chirurgeon,” the Pontifex’s voice echoed from behind a screen of honour guards. He sat upon a litter, propped up by cushions, his own body freshly strengthened by the Transference in the plaza. His voice was stronger now, sharpened by Alistair’s compromise. “This is not a dissection. It is a liberation. You are not taking a life, but redistributing a resource. The Glimmer within the guardian is the last, pure catalyst. It will reignite the Heart. The Withering will be reversed. Millions will breathe easy.”

Kael stood to Alistair’s right, hand resting on the pommel of his sword. His eyes were narrowed, his jaw clenched in a mix of anticipation and unease. Alistair could feel the tension coming from him, a solid force in the air.
On a pallet of white silk, directly before the largest, darkest crack in the Heart’s trunk, lay the child. He was Spirit-Touched, one of the guardian race. He looked perhaps eight years old, with skin the colour of birch bark and hair like spun milkweed. His eyes were closed, his eyelids fluttering with rapid dreams. A single, perfect teardrop of amber crystal, the mark of his people, glowed faintly on his forehead.
The air around the child seemed to r, as if reality itself was being stretched thin. Alistair shiver run down his spine as he looked at the child, his mind racing with what he was about to do. He was about to take a life, to cut the thread that connected this child to the Heart, to the world, and to himself.
But then he saw Elara’s face, not here in this sacred tomb, but in the memory of her dim, book-cluttered hovel. Her finger, smudged with ink, tracing a passage in a forbidden text. “They call it a ‘Withering,’ Alistair. They treat it with more Glimmer, like pouring water on a drowning man. But what if the sickness is in the soul of the world? What if we are the infection, and the Glimmer is its lifeblood, which we keep stealing? The guardians aren’t hoarding it. They are its stewards. We are killing the shepherd and blaming him for the wolves.”

He had dismissed it as poetic heresy. Now, the words wrapped around his spine, a living thing that pulsed with a dark energy. A cold sweat broke out on his forehead as he understood the truth: he was not a healer, but a killer. He was not a saviour, but a destroyer.
“Alistair,” Kael said, his voice low and urgent. “The optimal moment is passing. The Heart’s rhythm is failing.”

Alistair did not look at him. He glanced at his hands, sheathed in thin lambskin. He saw other hands. The hands of the man he had been, holding a different, ordinary scalpel in a sun-drenched operating theatre in Lystra. He had saved a merchant prince that day, repairing a ruptured vessel with meticulous stitches. He had gone home to his daughter, Anya, who had a fever. He had prescribed willow bark and cool cloths. It was a simple fever. But it did not break. It burned, and he, the great chirurgeon, with all his knowledge, had been powerless.
He had held her small, burning hand as the light left her eyes, his oath echoing in his mind. Do no harm. What was the harm in failing to act? The Pontifex's agents had found him weeks later, drowning in grief and debt, and offered him a new world, a new purpose, a chance to master the one force that had defeated him: death itself.
He had taken it, telling himself it was for redemption, to learn secrets that could prevent any parent from ever feeling his pain. But this world had its own cost. The faces of the people he had taken from flashed before him: the old man with the defiant eyes, whose life force now powered the scalpel; the young woman who had sung a lullaby until the needle silenced her; the branded heretic in the plaza, whose last breath had been a sigh of relief.
He was the chief extractor, the one who had taken the life force from these people, leaving them to wither and die. And now, he was about to take the life force from this child, this Spirit-Touched guardian, who was a living, breathing being, not just a means to an end.
The child's chest rose and fell with a slow, steady rhythm, as if he sensed his fate. Alistair pang of guilt, feelings of betrayal he had never before. He was about to break his oath, to shatter the trust that had been placed in him. He was about to take a life, and he knew he would never be able to forgive himself.
The silence in the cavern was crushing, pressing down on Alistair's shoulders. His conscience weighed heavily on him, filled with guilt and doubt. He knew he had to make a choice: follow his oath or follow his heart.
In that moment, he knew he couldn't do it. He couldn't take the child's life, sever the thread that connected him to the world and to himself. He couldn't break his oath, shatter the trust that had been placed in him.
The child's eyes flickered open, and Alistair saw a spark of recognition, a glimmer of life that ignited something within him. He knew he had to act, make a choice, decide what to do.
But the moment had passed, and Alistair was left with his doubts, fears, and guilt. He knew he had failed, broken his oath, and would never be able to forgive himself.
The child's eyes locked onto Alistair's, and he saw a glimmer of understanding, a spark of life that ignited something within him. Alistair knew he had to act, make a choice, and decide what to do.
