Chapter 8: The Oath Broken

The air in the cavern was not still. It pulsed, a slow, sickly rhythm that matched the faint, dying luminescence of the Heart. Alistair stood at the base of the colossal crystalline tree, his boots sinking into a fine, grey powder that had once been vibrant moss. The Heart was not a thing of beauty anymore. It was a patient on the table, its arteries—great, branching veins of amber and rose quartz—clogged with black, fibrous growths. A sweet, cloying scent of decay, like overripe fruit and spoiled honey, warred with the sharp, clean smell of the antiseptic oils he had meticulously applied to his instruments.

The scent of decay clung to his skin, a constant reminder of the countless lives he had taken in the name of science. The instruments at his disposal seemed to mock him now, their silvered steel and glass gleaming in the dim light. The Transference needle, a hollow tube of glass and orichalcum, seemed to hum with a malevolent energy, as if it too felt the weight of his doubts.

They were laid out on a sterile white cloth atop a portable chirurgia table: retractors of silvered steel, clamps, a saw for the larger, corrupted branches if needed, and the scalpel. It glowed with a soft, captive light, charged with Glimmer siphoned from a dozen branded heretics in Modern London: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment.: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment. above. It hummed in his hand, a vibration that travelled up his arm and settled in the hollow of his chest.

“Remember, Chirurgeon,” the Pontifex’s voice echoed from behind a screen of honour guards. He sat upon a litter, propped up by cushions, his own body freshly invigorated by the Transference in the plaza. His voice was stronger now, a blade honed by Alistair’s compromise. “This is not a dissection. It is a liberation. You are not taking a life, but redistributing a resource. The Glimmer within the guardian is the last, pure catalyst. It will reignite the Heart. The Withering will be reversed. Millions will breathe easy.”

Kael stood to Alistair’s right, hand resting on the pommel of his sword. His eyes were narrowed, his jaw clenched in a mixture of anticipation and unease. Alistair could sense the tension emanating from him, a palpable force that seemed to vibrate through the air.

On a pallet of white silk, directly before the largest, darkest fissure in the Heart’s trunk, lay the child. He was Spirit-Touched, one of the guardian race. He looked perhaps eight years old, with skin the colour of birch bark and hair like spun milkweed. His eyes were closed, his eyelids fluttering with rapid dreams. A single, perfect teardrop of amber crystal, the mark of his people, glowed faintly on his forehead.

The air around the child seemed to shimmer, as if the very fabric of reality was being stretched to its limits. Alistair felt a shiver run down his spine as he gazed upon the child, his mind racing with the implications of what he was about to do. He was about to take a life, to sever the thread that connected this child to the Heart, to the world, and to himself.

But then he saw Elara’s face, not here in this sacred tomb, but in the memory of her dim, book-cluttered hovel. Her finger, smudged with ink, tracing a passage in a forbidden text. “They call it a ‘Withering,’ Alistair. They treat it with more Glimmer, like pouring water on a drowning man. But what if the sickness is in the soul of the world? What if we are the infection, and the Glimmer is its lifeblood, which we keep stealing? The guardians aren’t hoarding it. They are its stewards. We are killing the shepherd and blaming him for the wolves.”

He had dismissed it as poetic heresy. Now, the words coiled around his spine, a living, breathing thing that seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy. He felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead as he realized the truth: he was not a healer, but a killer. He was not a saviour, but a destroyer.

“Alistair,” Kael said, his voice low and urgent. “The optimal moment is passing. The Heart’s rhythm is decaying.”

Alistair did not look at him. He looked at his hands, sheathed in thin lambskin. He saw other hands. The hands of the man he had been, holding a different, non-magical scalpel in a sun-drenched operating theatre in Lystra. He had saved a merchant prince that day, repairing a ruptured vessel with meticulous stitches. He had gone home to his daughter, Anya, who had a fever. He had prescribed willow bark and cool cloths. It was a simple fever. But it did not break. It burned, and he, the great chirurgeon, with all his knowledge, had been powerless.

He had held her small, burning hand as the light left her eyes, his oath a hollow, ringing thing in his ears. Do no harm. What was the harm in failing to act? The Pontifex’s agents had found him weeks later, drowning in grief and debt, and offered him a new world, a new purpose, a chance to master the one force that had defeated him: death itself.

He had taken it. He had told himself it was for redemption. To learn secrets that could prevent any parent from ever feeling his void. But this world had its own price. The faces of the “donors” flashed before him: the old man with the defiant eyes, whose Glimmer now powered the scalpel; the young woman who had sung a lullaby until the needle silenced her; the branded heretic in the plaza, whose last breath had been a sigh of relief.

He was the chief extractor. He was the one who had taken the life force from these people, leaving them to wither and die. And now, he was about to take the life force from this child, this Spirit-Touched guardian, who was not a limb, but a living, breathing being.

The child’s chest rose and fell with a slow, steady rhythm, as if he was aware of the fate that awaited him. Alistair felt a pang of guilt, a sense of betrayal that he had never felt before. He was about to break his oath, to shatter the trust that had been placed in him. He was about to take a life, and he knew that he would never be able to forgive himself.

The silence in the cavern was oppressive, a heavy weight that pressed down upon Alistair’s shoulders. He felt the weight of his own conscience, the crushing burden of his own guilt. He knew that he had to make a choice, to decide whether to follow his oath, or to follow his heart.

And in that moment, he knew that he would not be able to do it. He would not be able to take the child’s life, to sever the thread that connected him to the Heart, to the world, and to himself. He would not be able to break his oath, to shatter the trust that had been placed in him.

The child’s eyes flickered open, and Alistair saw a glimmer of recognition, a spark of life that seemed to ignite a fire within him. He knew that he had to act, to make a choice, to decide whether to follow his oath, or to follow his heart.

But it was too late. The moment had passed, and Alistair was left with nothing but his own doubts, his own fears, and his own guilt. He knew that he had failed, that he had broken his oath, and that he would never be able to forgive himself.
