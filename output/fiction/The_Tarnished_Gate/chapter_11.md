 h the sound of arrows thudding into wood and flesh. Alistair was on the ground, Elara dragging him behind a fallen log as the first wave of attackers swarmed into the sanctuary.

They were not the Pontifex’s men. These were ragged, desperate figures, their faces gaunt, their eyes hollow. The Withering had taken them, but not as it had taken Modern London: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment.: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment.. Their flesh was not blackened, but grey, their limbs twisted, their movements jerky, unnatural. They carried crude weapons—broken tools, jagged stones, even their own bones—and they moved with a single, terrible purpose.

“What are they?” Elara gasped, her breath hot against his ear.

“Not the Pontifex,” Alistair said, his voice tight. “Something worse. The Withering’s last, dying grasp. It’s using them as puppets, driving them to destroy the Gate. To keep us from leaving.”

The Spirit-Touched moved like shadows, their silver eyes glowing faintly in the dim light. They fought with a quiet, terrible efficiency, their hands moving in intricate patterns that left the attackers frozen in place, their bodies crumbling to dust. But there were too many.

Kael and his men formed a defensive line, their swords flashing in the fading light. Alistair could see the strain in their faces, the way their movements were slowing, their breaths coming in ragged gasps. They were outnumbered, and the Withering’s puppets showed no sign of tiring.

Elara’s grip on his arm tightened. “We have to do something.”

Alistair looked at his petrified hand, the grey veins spreading slowly, inexorably. “I can’t fight. Not like this.”

“Then what?” she demanded, her voice sharp with desperation.

He looked at the Gate, its prismatic storm pulsing in the distance. “I have an idea. But it’s going to hurt.”

The pain was a white-hot, searing agony that left him gasping, his vision swimming. He could feel the corruption in his veins, the cold, dead weight of it, and he forced it outward, using the Anchor’s power to push it into the attackers. The grey veins in his arm pulsed, and the puppets of the Withering froze, their bodies crumbling to dust.

But the effort left him weak, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Elara caught him as he stumbled, her arms tight around him. “You’re going to kill yourself,” she whispered, her voice tight with fear.

He managed a weak smile. “I’m already dead, Elara. This is just the afterlife.”

The battle raged on, the Spirit-Touched and Kael’s men fighting desperately to hold the line. But the attackers kept coming, their numbers seemingly endless. Alistair could feel the corruption in his veins, the cold, dead weight of it, and he knew that he couldn’t hold out much longer.

“Alistair,” Elara said, her voice urgent. “We have to go. Now.”

He looked at the Gate, its prismatic storm pulsing in the distance. “I can’t leave. Not yet.”

“You have to,” she insisted, her grip on his arm tightening. “You’re the only one who can stop this. You’re the Anchor. You have to go through the Gate.”

He shook his head, his vision swimming. “I can’t. The corruption—”

“You have to,” she said, her voice firm. “You’re the only one who can stop the Pontifex. You’re the only one who can save the child. You have to go through the Gate.”

He looked at her, his heart aching. “And if I don’t make it?”

She met his gaze, her eyes filled with a quiet determination. “Then I’ll follow you. But you have to try.”

He took a deep breath, the pain in his veins a constant, searing agony. “Alright. Let’s go.”

They moved quickly, Elara supporting him as they made their way towards the Gate. The air around it was thick with energy, the hum of it a constant, painful vibration. Alistair could feel the corruption in his veins, the cold, dead weight of it, and he knew that he had to be careful. One wrong move, and the Gate would tear him apart.

They reached the edge of the rift, the prismatic storm swirling before them. Alistair could feel the energy of it, the raw, chaotic power of it, and he knew that he had to be careful. One wrong move, and the Gate would tear him apart.

He took a deep breath, the pain in his veins a constant, searing agony. “Alright. Let’s go.”

They stepped through the Gate, the energy of it washing over them like a tidal wave. The world around them was a blur of light and shadow, the energy of the Gate a constant, painful vibration. Alistair could feel the corruption in his veins, the cold, dead weight of it, and he knew that he had to be careful. One wrong move, and the Gate would tear him apart.

They emerged on the other side, the world around them a blur of light and shadow. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and the taste of metal. Alistair could feel the corruption in his veins, the cold, dead weight of it, and he knew that he had to be careful. One wrong move, and the Gate would tear him apart.
