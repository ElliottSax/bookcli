Chapter 6: The Public Procedure

CHAPTER SIX: THE PUBLIC PROCEDURE

The air in the Cathedral Plaza tasted of incense, dust, and the iron-sharp tang of anticipation. Ten thousand souls packed the tiered stone steps, a murmuring, sweating organism draped in the grey and crimson of the Orthodoxy. Their collective breath fogged the cold morning air, rising toward the twin spires of the Sanctum where pennants snapped like angry teeth. Alistair stood at the center of it all, on a raised marble dais, and like a specimen pinned to a slide.
His hands, scrubbed raw in rosewater and lye, were sheathed in thin, silver-stitched gloves. His usual infirmary smock had been replaced by a surgeon’s robe of stark white wool, a deliberate anachronism that made him a ghost among the gold-threaded vestments of the clergy. It was a costume. He was playing the part of the Ascendant Physician, the Saint-in-Flesh, the Divine Scalpel. The titles were a garrote.
“The spectacle is the suture,” Inquisitor Kael had told him the night before, his voice a dry rustle in Alistair’s sterile quarters. “It binds the wound of doubt in the populace. You are not merely performing a procedure. You are performing faith. The Pontifex’s body is the body politic. His healing is our unity.”

Now, Kael stood to the right of the great, canopied throne, a shadow in polished obsidian armor. On the throne sat Pontifex Valerius II. From a distance, he was a monument: a broad, powerful frame wrapped in cloth-of-gold, a face of stern, paternal benevolence carved into wrinkles. Up close, which Alistair had been forced to endure during the preparatory blessings, the truth was a horror of atrophy. The gold hung loose. The powerful frame was a cage of brittle bones. A sweet, cloying scent of decay—like overripe pears and gangrene—clung to him, masked poorly by clouds of frankincense. His eyes, once famed for their piercing blue, were the color of tarnished milk, swimming in a desperate, hungry awareness. He was a man being eaten from the inside by a quiet, magical rot.
Opposite the dais, chained to a steel post sunk into the marble, was the donor.
He was an old man, thin as a winter branch, wearing only a rough loincloth. His skin was a map of old scars and fresh bruises, but it was the brand on his chest that held the crowd’s gaze: a spiraling, blackened sigil that marked him as a ‘Glimmer-Hoarder,’ a heretic who allegedly practiced unsanctioned Transference. His crime, bellowed by the Herald an hour ago, was stealing vitality from a loyal citizen to prolong his own wretched life. The crowd had roared its disgust. Now, they watched him with a hungry, righteous silence.
The old man’s eyes were not silent. They found Alistair’s across the twenty paces of polished stone, and they held a depth of clarity that was terrifying. No fear, no pleading. Just a cold, evaluative scorn.
A bell tolled, a single, profound note that swallowed the last of the murmurs. The Pontifex raised a trembling, bejeweled hand.
“Let the Transference begin,” he rasped, the amplification crystals around the dais making his weakness a public, pathetic vibration. “Let the unworthy fuel the worthy. Let the corrupted spark restore the divine flame. So commands the Orthodoxy.”

A quartet of choristers began a low, dissonant chant. It was meant to be celestial. To Alistair, it sounded like the hum of a high-tension wire.
He walked to the center of the dais, to the two prepared tables. One, plush with velvet and silk, awaited the Pontifex. The other was bare, cold steel, with leather restraints at the wrists and ankles. His instruments were laid out on a side table: not his familiar, precise steel from another world, but objects of ritual and magic. A silver bowl etched with venous channels. A jagged, clear crystal dagger called the Lancet of Division. A smooth, black basalt rod—the Conductor. They alien and clumsy in his gloved hands.
“Bring the source,” Alistair said. His voice, amplified, did not sound like his own. It was flat, drained of all inflection. A clinical command.
Guards unlocked the old man’s chains. He did not struggle as they marched him to the steel table. He moved with a stiff, dignified grace, lying back on the cold surface as if settling into his own coffin. As the guards tightened the leather straps, his eyes never left Alistair’s.
Alistair approached, the Conductor rod in hand. His own heartbeat was a distant, irrelevant thud. He had learned this skill, this cursed magic. He had practiced on dying flowers, on sickened rats, on the secretly condemned in the bowels of the Sanctum. He was, as Kael had noted with chilling approval, a natural. He could feel the Vital Glimmer in every living thing—a shimmering, ephemeral current beneath the skin, unique as a fingerprint. To heal, you had to steal it. To steal it, you had to sever its connection to its host with the crystal dagger, then channel it through the Conductor into the recipient. It was not surgery. It was magical vivisection.
He placed the tip of the Conductor against the old man’s branded chest. The skin was warm. The Glimmer within like a slow, deep, ancient river—surprisingly strong for one so frail. A life of stubborn resilience.
“You are the saint from the other side of the Gate,” the old man whispered, his voice too low for the crystals to catch. It was for Alistair alone. “The answer to their prayers.”

Alistair said nothing. He positioned the silver bowl beneath the man’s right hand.
“I knew your predecessor,” the old man continued, his breath fogging in the cold. “The one they executed. He had a theory. He replied the Glimmer isn’t just life. It’s memory. It’s experience. You take it, you take everything.”

“Be silent,” Alistair murmured, the words automatic. He picked up the Lancet. It caught the pale sun, fracturing it into sickly rainbows.
“He’s not sick,” the old man hissed, his composure cracking for the first time, revealing a ferocious intensity. “He’s empty. He’s burned through his own Glimmer, and the Glimmer of a hundred others you never knew about. He’s a leaky vessel. You fill him today, he’ll be thirsty again by next winter. And they’ll find you another heretic. And another.”

Alistair’s fingers tightened on the Lancet. He knew. Some deep, unacknowledged part of him had already pieced it together. The Pontifex’s wasting was too profound, too consumptive. This was not an illness. This was the consequence of a different, hidden Transference—one that moved not from donor to recipient, but from a hundred donors into a single, bottomless well.
“Procedure,” Kael’s voice cut across the dais, smooth and inexorable. “Proceed.”

The old man’s eyes locked onto Alistair’s. The defiance returned, crystallizing into something else. A terrible, knowing pity. “So, Saint. Let’s see your divinity.”

Alistair’s mind split. The conscious part—the Alistair who remembered sutures and antiseptic, who had secretly mended a beggar’s broken foot simply yesterday using stolen linen and a whisper of stolen Glimmer from a dying rat—that part receded, screaming, into a small, dark room in the back of his skull. The part that remained was all function. All precision.
He raised the Lancet. The chant rose to a crescendo. The crowd held its breath.
With a motion that was neither brutal nor hesitant, but exactly as practiced, he drew the crystal edge across the palm of the old man’s restrained hand. No blood welled. Instead, a seam of light opened—a fissure of pure, gold-white luminescence. The Vital Glimmer, exposed.
The old man gasped, a short, sharp sound of ultimate violation. His back arched against the restraints.
Alistair did not hesitate. He placed the Conductor rod against the glowing fissure. He focused. He reached.
His talent unfolded, a cold, predatory sense. He could feel the Glimmer’s tethers to the old man’s soul—like countless, silken, luminous threads. With a thought as sharp as any scalpel, he severed them.
The old man’s body convulsed. A soundless scream contorted his face. The light from his hand pulsed, then flow, siphoned up the black basalt rod. It gathered in the air above them, a swirling, captive star, throwing stark, dancing shadows across the enraptured faces of the crowd.
Alistair’s detached self observed the process. The Glimmer was warm in his metaphysical grip. He could feel echoes in it: the scent of rain on dry earth, the muscle-memory of swinging an axe, the taste of cheap, sour wine, the fierce, protective love for a face he would never know. The old man’s theory was correct. It was memory. It was self.
He turned, the Conductor humming in his hand, trailing the comet’s-tail of stolen life. He approached the Pontifex, who was now leaning forward on his throne, lips wet with anticipation, the milky eyes fixed on the light with addict’s hunger.
“Now, Ascendant,” the Pontifex whispered, his voice a dry leaf-rattle. “Make me whole.”

Alistair placed the Conductor’s tip against the Pontifex’s chest, over his heart. He willed the Glimmer to transfer.
It rushed in with a violent eagerness. The Pontifex shuddered, his mouth falling open. Color flooded his pale skin. The sagging flesh of his face appeared to tighten, as if invisible hands were reshaping it. The milky haze in his eyes dissolved, revealing the famous, piercing blue, now blazing with a newfound energy. He grew visibly larger, his frame filling the golden robes, his spine straightening. A deep, satisfied sigh rolled from him, amplified to the crowd.
On the steel table, the old man gave one final, shuddering breath. As the last of his life left him, he spoke. His voice was not amplified, but Alistair, standing between donor and recipient, heard it clearly. It was a curse, spoken in a voice that was barely audible, yeto resonate inside Alistair's mind.
“May your hands never be clean, Saint. May every life you touch feel the cold of that steel. May you find your way home only through a field of graves.”

Then the light was gone. The old man's head lolled, eyes now the color of stone, fixed on the grey sky. Empty.
The Conductor rod grew cold in Alistair's hand. The procedure was complete.
For a moment, silence. Then the Pontifex rose from his throne. He stood tall, powerful, radiating a health that seemed almost unnatural. He raised his arms, and the sun gleamed on firm, rejuvenated muscle.
The plaza erupted.
The sound was overwhelming, a wave of adoration, relief, and fanatical triumph. Ten thousand voices screamed praise to the Orthodoxy, to the Pontifex, to the Divine Scalpel. Flowers rained down onto the dais. People wept and embraced. The chant became a triumphant, soaring hymn.
Alistair stood between the empty vessel and the refilled one. The cheers washed over him, meaningless as the crash of distant surf. He looked at his gloved hands. They were spotless. No blood. No trace of life. He nothing. The part of him that had performed the act was already filing it away, a successful operation. The part that had hidden was now staring, numb, at the hollow shell on the table. The old man's curse didn't feel like a magical imposition. It like a truth.
Kael appeared at his side, gripping his elbow with a gauntleted hand. “You did well, Ascendant. You have given them what they wanted.” He gestured to the weeping, joyous crowd. “You have given them a reason to believe.”

“I have given them a lie,” Alistair said, his voice dead.
“All lies are necessary,” Kael replied, steering him away from the tables as attendants rushed to cover the donor's body and attend to the glowing, revitalized Pontifex. “Come. Your work today is done. There is something you need to see.”

The celebration echoed through the marble halls of the Pontifical wing, a distant, mocking sound. Kael led him not to the infirmary or his quarters, but to a secluded balcony overlooking the private gardens, now barren in the late autumn chill. The noise faded here, replaced by the whisper of a bitter wind.
Kael leaned against the balustrade, his obsidian armor absorbing the weak light. “You are troubled by the old man's words.”

“He was a man,” Alista answered, staring at his hands as he peeled off the silver-stitched gloves. “Not just a means to an end. And he died so a corrupt old man could feel the sun on his face for another season.”

“A heretic,” Kael corrected, his tone unchanged. “And a willing participant in the restoration of order. His sacrifice has united the people, strengthened the Pontifex, and secured your position. It was a necessary act.”

“I didn’t come here to be your tool,” Alistair spat, the numbness finally giving way to a hot, corrosive anger. “I came here by accident. I want to go home.”

Kael turned his head, his pale eyes considering Alistair as if for the first time. “I know. And your home is a world without the Glimmer. A world of machines and electricity. A world where a man's life cannot be taken with a crystal knife.”

A chill seized Alistair's spine. He had never described his world in such detail. Not to Kael.
“How—?”

“The previous Gate-walker. The heretic you replaced. He spoke of a 'Tarnished Gate' that was once open. He believed it could be opened no merely st by chance, but by will. By a key.”

Alistair's heart hammered against his ribs. “A key.”

“A powerful tool,” Kael said, pushing away from the balustrade, standing directly before him. “The Orthodoxy has searched for it for centuries. We believe we have found it.”

Hope flared in Alistair's chest, but he crushed it. “What do you want?”

“The key is inert. It is known as the ‘Heart of the World.’ And it is dying. Failing. It requires healing.” Kael’s gaze was relentless. “You are the only being to ever walk through the Gate who possesses both the knowledge of a foreign healer and the innate talent for Transference. You are, in a literal sense, the only person in all of existence who might be able to mend it.”

“Mend it… how?”

“By performing a Transference on a scale never imagined. A Grand Transference. To heal the Heart of the World would require a donor of commensurate vitality. A sacrifice of… magnitude.”

The hook was set. Alistair it pierce deep. Home. A field of graves. The old man’s curse whispered in the wind.
“What kind of sacrifice?”

Kael’s smile was a thin, cold slit. “That is the question, isn’t it? To reopen the Tarnished Gate, to give you your path back, you must first heal the Heart. The donor required would not be a single heretic, Alistair. It would need to be a source of Glimmer so vast, so profound, it would make today’s procedure seem like a pinprick. Think on it. The Pontifex’s little thirsts are a distraction. This… this is your purpose. Your only way back.”

He placed a heavy, armored hand on Alistair’s shoulder. The touch was like ice.
“Rest now, Ascendant. Celebrate your triumph. The crowd adores you.” Kael’s voice dropped to a whisper, blending with the gathering dusk. “And when you are ready to stop being a spectacle and start being a savior—your own savior—we will discuss the unimaginable sacrifice. We will discuss how to make you the surgeon of a world, and the keeper of your own escape.”

Kael left him then, on the barren balcony. The cheers from the plaza had finally died, leaving only the hollow sound of the wind. Below, attendants carried a shrouded body on a simple litter through the grey gardens. Above, the first, cold stars pricked the evening sky, indifferent and far away. Alistair clutched the marble railing, the taste of ashes thick in his mouth, the ghost of stolen Glimmer burning like frost on his clean, clean hands. The path home was now a visible road, stretching before him into a darkness so profound it made the public procedure seem like a mercy.
