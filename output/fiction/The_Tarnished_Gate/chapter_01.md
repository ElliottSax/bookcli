Chapter 1: The Severed Path

A clean, clinical incision—the verdict severed Dr. Alistair Finch from his life with a precision he could only admire, even as he bled out on the steps. Sterile and devoid of malice, the words were worse for it. “Gross negligence.” “Failure of standard of care.” “License revoked, permanently.” Recited by the disciplinary board’s chairman with the flat cadence of a man reading a grocery list, each term was a scalpel, flaying away the layers of his identity: the surgeon, the healer, the man of respect. Exposed to the cold air of the chamber, what remained was raw and unrecognizable.

He did not move. His hands, usually resting with a deliberate, practiced stillness, clenched in his lap, knuckles bone-white against the dark wool of his suit. A phantom weight balanced in his right palm—the memory of a scalpel, a more honest instrument than any of this. It only cut what you directed it to cut. The law, it seemed, was a blunt-force trauma.

From the gallery came a murmur of satisfied exhalation. Turning was unnecessary to see the triumph on the reporters’ faces or the grim vindication on those of his former colleagues who had testified. “A brilliant man,” they’d said, “but prone to overconfidence. A risk-taker.” They had framed his intuition as recklessness, his decisive hands as arrogance. On the screen, the aneurysm—a pulsing, grotesque cherry buried deep in the motor cortex—had been a trap. Where others saw only certain catastrophe, he had seen a path, a narrow, glittering possibility.

He had been wrong. Under his instruments, the vessel burst, flooding the pristine field with a dark, final tide. Eleanor Voss, age forty-four, mother of two, ceased to be a person on his table. She became a statistic, and he became its author.

“Dr. Finch.”

He looked up. The chairman addressed him directly, peering over his glasses. “Do you have anything to say before we adjourn?”

Alistair’s tongue was a dry sponge. What was there to say? That the imaging had been misleading? That the patient’s physiology had been anomalous? That in the very nerves of his fingers, he had known he could save her? It was all just noise now. Excuses. The body on the slab was the only truth that mattered.

“No,” he said, his voice a rusted hinge. “Nothing.”

The gavel fell. A single, sharp crack like the breaking of a spine.

Outside, a fine, needling drizzle began, perfectly suited to the mood. It beaded on the shoulders of his overcoat and blurred the grand, imposing steps into a grey smear. Hoping for a back exit, a moment of quiet obliteration, he found instead a small, soaked cluster of media waiting, their cameras hooded like predatory birds.

“Dr. Finch! Any reaction to the verdict?”

“Will you appeal?”

“Do you feel responsible for Eleanor Voss’s death?”

Jabbing, quick and shallow, the questions came. He kept his head down, moving with the stiff gait of a man walking against a gale.

Then the scrum parted.

The Voss family stood apart, under the partial shelter of a stone lion. Martin Voss, his face a monument of weathered grief, held an arm around his son, a teenager whose expression was pure, uncomprehending fury. Beside them, an older woman—Eleanor’s mother—held the hand of a small girl, maybe seven, clutching a sodden plush rabbit. They weren’t looking at the reporters. They were looking only at him.

A morbid autopilot carried him forward. He had to say something—something beyond the legalese and formal condolences issued by his lawyer. Stopping a few feet from them, rain dripped from the brim of his hat, a tiny, ticking curtain between their world and his.

“Martin,” Alistair began, then faltered. The clinical terms deserted him. “Mr. Voss. I… there are no words that can suffice.”

Martin Voss’s eyes were red-rimmed, but dry. “You told us you could save her,” he said, his voice low and shredded. “You looked me in the eye, in that white room with the scans on the wall, and you said, ‘The odds are challenging, but the alternative is a slow decline. I have a path.’” He mimicked Alistair’s calm, measured tone with devastating accuracy. “A path. Was that just surgeon talk? Just something you say to get the signature?”

“It was what I believed,” Alistair whispered. The admission was ash in his mouth.

The boy, Liam, took a sudden, sharp step forward. “You killed her! You just wanted to be the big-shot hero!” Spittle flew from his lips, mingling with the rain.

“Liam,” Martin said, pulling him back, but his own grip was trembling.

Sophie, the little girl, looked up at Alistair. Her eyes, the same sea-green as her mother’s, held a confusion deeper than anger. “The rabbit got wet,” she said, holding up the bedraggled toy. “Mummy always dries him by the fire.”

That was the cut that found the gap in his armor—so small, so utterly human. A ritual of care, forever interrupted. Something ruptured inside him, not with a bang, but with a quiet, definitive tear. The shame was no longer an abstract professional failing; it was this wet rabbit, this lost fire, this shattered rhythm of love.

“I am so sorry,” he said, the words utterly inadequate, the only ones he had. “For everything.”

Turning, he walked away, their silent, accusing presence a weight on his back heavier than any legal judgment. Sensing a more potent spectacle, the reporters swarmed the family instead, their microphones blooming like metallic fungi. Alistair was forgotten, a ghost already.

For hours he walked, directionless. The drizzle hardened into a proper downpour, drumming on the pavement and overflowing the gutters. His expensive shoes were ruined, his socks sponges of icy water. City lights bled into streaks of gold and white on the wet asphalt.

Passing the hospital wherehe had once been a titan, its windows glowed like a thousand indifferent eyes.als, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment., a towering citadel of glass and steel, he walked on. His name had already been scrubbed from the directory in the lobby; he’d checked that morning, a final act of masochism. Eventually, his steps carried him into the older part of Modern London: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment.: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment., where the buildings hunched closer together and the trees were ancient, gnarled things. Modern London: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment.: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment. was a Victorian relic, a quilt of formal gardens, walking paths, and forgotten statuary, usually locked at dusk. Tonight, the wrought-iron gate was swinging loose on one hinge, battered by the wind. Without thinking, he slipped inside. The world changed. The roar of Modern London: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment.: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment. muted to a distant sigh, swallowed by the thrashing of leaves and the drumming on broad, waxy rhododendron leaves. The air smelled of wet earth, decaying mulch, and the faint, sweet rot of autumn flowers past their prime. Paths of crushed gravel wound into darkness, illuminated at intervals by the sickly orange glow of antique lampposts, their light barely penetrating the swirling veils of rain. Alistair stumbled along a lesser-used path, his body moving on a failing battery. He was a machine in systemic shutdown. The clinical part of his mind, ever-observant, catalogued the symptoms: hypothermia setting in, cognitive processing slowed, emotional affect flatlined. He was a corpse with a stumbling gait. The path ended at a low, mossy wall of stacked stone. Beyond it was a sunken garden, long neglected. A marble nymph, stained green with algae, wept eternally into a dry basin. And there, nestled in a thicket of untamed yew, was The Tarnished Gate itself: A massive, silver-etched archway, tarnished black in patches, the portal between worlds. itself: A massive, silver-etched archway, tarnished black in patches, the portal between worlds.. It was wrong. It was made of a metal that seemed to drink the lamplight, not reflect it—a dull, greyish alloy that looked both ancient and uncannily new. It was simple in form: two uprights and a lintel, but the proportions were subtly off, making his eyes ache. Vines clung to it, but they were blackened and brittle, as if the thing had recently been hot. And it hummed. Not a sound you heard with your ears, but one you felt in your teeth and the marrow of your bones. A low, sub-aural vibration that set his fillings tingling. The rain seemed to shy away from it; the ground within The Tarnished Gate itself: A massive, silver-etched archway, tarnished black in patches, the portal between worlds. itself: A massive, silver-etched archway, tarnished black in patches, the portal between worlds. was dry, covered in a fine, silvery dust. Alistair stopped, his clinical mind sparking feebly against the impossibility. A forgotten folly? Some public art installation? But no plaque explained it, no path led purposefully to it. It was a thing that had been un-made by Modern London: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment.: sterile hospitals, austere courtrooms, Alistair's empty apartment.’s consciousness, left to rot in this green, wet silence. He should have turned back. He should have sought a shelter, called a lawyer, a friend, anyone. But he had no one left to call. And The Tarnished Gate itself: A massive, silver-etched archway, tarnished black in patches, the portal between worlds. itself: A massive, silver-etched archway, tarnished black in patches, the portal between worlds.… it offered a different kind of path. A final, definitive severance. Driven by a despair so complete it felt like curiosity, he stepped forward. He reached out a trembling, ruined hand—the hand that had held the scalpel, that had signed the consent forms, that had failed—and placed his palm flat against the metal of the upright. It was warm. Not sun-warmed, but alive with a deep, internal heat. The vibration surged up his arm, rattling his bones. The silvery dust at his feet began to swirl, lifting in a vortex that defied the lashing rain. The hum became a deafening roar inside his skull. Panic, pristine and electric, finally shot through his numbness. He tried to pull back, but his hand was fused to the metal. He watched, detached, as the grey substance seemed to flow up over his skin, encasing his fingers, his wrist. It was not painful. It was a profound, cellular unwinding. The world tore. It was not a passage, but an excision. The park, the rain, the night—they were sliced away from his sensorium with violent finality. There was a sensation of being pulled through a hole too small, his very molecules protesting, stretching, scrambling. Light—not a tunnel’s end, but a solid, blinding wall of it—slammed into him. He had a fleeting, nonsensical memory from the operating theatre: the moment the aneurysm had let go, a catastrophic, interior sunburst. Then, nothing. Consciousness returned not as a dawn, but as a faulty switch being flicked on. Pain was the first tenant. A deep, musculoskeletal agony, as if every joint had been dislocated and poorly reset. He was lying on his back. The surface beneath him was not gravel or grass, but something granular and uneven, like coarse sand mixed with small, hard nodules. He opened his eyes to a sky that was an offense. It was a sickly, bilious green, the color of an infected wound or old bruise. A sun, too large and pallid, hung in a haze of ochre clouds, casting a wan, shadowless light that made everything look both lurid and drained. The air was thick, hot, and carried a scent he could not immediately place—ozone, yes, but underneath it, the coppery tang of blood and the sweet, cloying smell of overripe fruit, just on the edge of fermentation. Alistair gasped, and the air scraped his throat. He tried to sit up, his surgeon’s mind automatically running a diagnostic: possible rib fractures, severe dehydration, shock, probable retinal damage from the light… The chanting began. It was a low, guttural drone, coming from all around him. He managed to push himself up onto his elbows, the world tilting nauseously. Figures knelt in a rough circle around him, perhaps a dozen. They were robed in coarse, undyed fabric, stained with earth and other, less identifiable substances. Their hoods were drawn up, shadows hiding their faces. He was on a plain of cracked, greyish earth, dotted with sparse, thorny vegetation that glistened with a sticky, black resin. In the distance, jagged, purple-black mountains clawed at the green sky. The arch was gone. There The word hung in the poisoned air, a title, a prayer, an indictment. Mender. Alistair stared at his own clean, empty hands, feeling the scalpel of their expectation. He opened his mouth, a refusal forming on his tongue—I can’t, I’m not, you’re wrong—but the man with the milky eyes lurched forward, his own scarred hand closing around Alistair’s wrist.

The touch was a brand. Not of heat, but of a sudden, violent inversion. The gritty wind, the aching sky, the chorus of desperate faces—it all bled away, replaced by a single, searing vision that was not his own: a sterile white room, the whir of a bone-saw, his own hands, steady and gloved, holding a gleaming prosthetic limb. The image was overlaid with a profound, soul-deep gratitude that was not his feeling, but the leather-faced man’s memory.

He was not just being asked to mend. He was being recognized.

As the vision shattered, the man released him, weeping openly. But Alistair’s gaze was locked on his own traitorous hands. For in the fleeting echo of that memory, they had not felt useless. They had felt…knowing. The hope in the circle solidified into a terrifying certainty. They hadn’t found a stranger. They had found the specific man whose face they remembered from a miracle performed in another world. And that meant his arrival here was no accident. It was a homecoming he could not recall, for a purpose he had already begun.
