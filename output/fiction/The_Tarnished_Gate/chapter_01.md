Chapter 1: The Severed Path

A clean, clinical incision—the verdict severed Dr. Alistair Finch from his life with a precision he could only admire, even as he bled out on the steps. Sterile and devoid of malice, the words were worse for it. “Gross negligence.” “Failure of standard of care.” “License revoked, permanently.” Recited by the disciplinary board’s chairman with the flat cadence of a man reading a grocery list, each term was a scalpel, flaying away the layers of his identity: the surgeon, the healer, the man of respect. Exposed to the cold air of the chamber, what remained was raw and unrecognizable.
He did not move. His hands, usually resting with a deliberate, practiced stillness, clenched in his lap, knuckles bone-white against the dark wool of his suit. A phantom weight balanced in his right palm—the memory of a scalpel, a more honest instrument than any of this. It only cut what you directed it to cut. The law, it seemed, was a blunt-force trauma.
From the gallery came a murmur of satisfied exhalation. Turning was unnecessary to see the triumph on the reporters’ faces or the grim vindication on those of his former colleagues who had testified. “A brilliant man,” they’d said, “but prone to overconfidence. A risk-taker.” They had framed his intuition as recklessness, his decisive hands as arrogance. On the screen, the aneurysm—a pulsing, grotesque cherry buried deep in the motor cortex—had been a trap. Where others saw only certain catastrophe, he had seen a path, a narrow, glittering possibility.
He had been wrong. Under his instruments, the vessel burst, flooding the pristine field with a dark, final tide. Eleanor Voss, age forty-four, mother of two, ceased to be a person on his table. She became a statistic, and he became its author.
“Dr. Finch.”

He looked up. The chairman addressed him directly, peering over his glasses. “Do you have anything to say before we adjourn?”

Alistair’s tongue was a dry sponge. What was there to say? That the imaging had been misleading? That the patient’s physiology had been anomalous? That in the very nerves of his fingers, he had known he could save her? It was all just noise now. Excuses. The body on the slab was the only truth that mattered.
“No,” he said, his voice a rusted hinge. “Nothing.”

The gavel fell. A single, sharp crack like the breaking of a spine.
Outside, a fine, needling drizzle began, perfectly suited to the mood. It beaded on the shoulders of his overcoat and blurred the grand, imposing steps into a grey smear. Hoping for a back exit, a moment of quiet obliteration, he found instead a small, soaked cluster of media waiting, their cameras hooded like predatory birds.
“Dr. Finch! Any reaction to the verdict?”

“Will you appeal?”

“Do you feel responsible for Eleanor Voss’s death?”

Jabbing, quick and shallow, the questions came. He kept his head down, moving with the stiff gait of a man walking against a gale.
Then the scrum parted.
The Voss family stood apart, under the partial shelter of a stone lion. Martin Voss, his face a monument of weathered grief, held an arm around his son, a teenager whose expression was pure, uncomprehending fury. Beside them, an older woman—Eleanor’s mother—held the hand of a small girl, maybe seven, clutching a sodden plush rabbit. They weren’t looking at the reporters. They were looking only at him.
A morbid autopilot carried him forward. He had to say something—something beyond the legalese and formal condolences issued by his lawyer. Stopping a few feet from them, rain dripped from the brim of his hat, a tiny, ticking curtain between their world and his.
“Martin,” Alistair began, then faltered. The clinical terms deserted him. “Mr. Voss. I… there are no words that can suffice.”

Martin Voss’s eyes were red-rimmed, but dry. “You told us you could save her,” he replied, his voice low and shredded. “You looked me in the eye, in that white room with the scans on the wall, and you said, ‘The odds are challenging, but the alternative is a slow decline. I have a path.’” He mimicked Alistair’s calm, measured tone with devastating accuracy. “A path. Was that just surgeon talk? Simply something you say to get the signature?”

“It was what I believed,” Alistair whispered. The admission was ash in his mouth.
The boy, Liam, took a sudden, sharp step forward. “You killed her! You just wanted to be the big-shot hero!” Spittle flew from his lips, mingling with the rain.
“Liam,” Mart answered, pulling him back, but his own grip was trembling.
Sophie, the little girl, glanced up at Alistair. Her eyes, the same sea-green as her mother’s, held a confusion deeper than anger. “The rabbit got wet,” she said, holding up the bedraggled toy. “Mummy always dries him by the fire.”

That was the cut that found the gap in his armor—so tiny, so utterly human. A ritual of care, forever interrupted. Something ruptured inside him, not with a bang, but with a quiet, definitive tear. The shame was no longer an abstract professional failing; it was this wet rabbit, this lost fire, this shattered rhythm of love.
“I am so sorrmurmuredhe said, the words utterly inadequate, the only ones he had. “For everything.”

Turning, he walked away, their silent, accusing presence a weight on his back heavier than any legal judgment. Sensing a more potent spectacle, the reporters swarmed the family instead, their microphones blooming like metallic fungi. Alistair was forgotten, a ghost already.
For hours he walked, directionless. The drizzle hardened into a proper downpour, drumming on the pavement and overflowing the gutters. His expensive shoes were ruined, his socks sponges of icy water. City lights bled into streaks of gold and white on the wet asphalt.
Passing the hospital where he had once been a prominent figure, its windows glowed like a thousand indifferent eyes. He strode on, his steps carrying him into the older part of London, where sterile hospitals and austere courtrooms gave way to a more worn landscape. Alistair's empty apartment wa merely st one of many buildings that appeared to hunch closer together here, their ancient, gnarled trees evidence of the area's age. London was a city of contrasts, with formal gardens, walking paths, and forgotten statuary often locked away at dusk. Tonight, however, the wrought-iron gate to one such garden was swinging loose on one hinge, battered by the wind. Without thinking, he slipped inside.
The world around him changed. The roar of the city muted to a distant sigh, replaced by the sound of leaves thrashing and rain drumming against broad, waxy rhododendron leaves. The air was thick with the smell of wet earth, decaying mulch, and the faint, sweet scent of autumn flowers past their prime. Paths of crushed gravel wound into darkness, illuminated at intervals by the sickly orange glow of antique lampposts. Alistair stumbled along a lesser-used path, his body moving on autopilot. He was exhausted, his mind numb.
As he walked, his clinical mind catalogued his symptoms: hypo the rmia setting in, cognitive processing slowed, emotional affect flatlined. He was a shadow of his former self, a man on the brink of collapse. The path ended at a low, mossy wall of stacked stone, beyond which lay a sunken garden, long neglected. A marble nymph, stained green with algae, stood eternally in a dry basin. And there, nestled in a thicket of untamed yew, was a massive, silver-etched archway, tarnished black in patches. It was an odd structure, one that seemed out of place in this forgotten garden.
The arch was made of a metal thato absorb the light around it, rather than reflect it. It was a dull, greyish alloy that looked both ancient and strangely new. The proportions of the arch were subtly off, making Alistair's eyes ache. Vines clung to it, but they were blackened and brittle, as if the thing had recently been hot. And it hummed, a low vibration that set his teeth on edge. The rain seemed to ay from it, and the ground within the arch was dry, covered in a fine, silvery dust.
Alistair stopped, his mind struggling to comprehend the impossibility of this structure. It was not a public art installation, nor was it a forgotten folly. It was simply a thing that had been left to rot in this green, wet silence. He should have turned back, sought shelter and called for help. But he had no one left to call, and the arch offered a different kind of path. A final, definitive severance.
Driven by a despair so complete it like curiosity, Alistair stepped forward. He reached out a trembling hand and placed his palm flat against the metal of the upright. It was warm, alive with a deep, internal heat. The vibration surged up his arm, rattling his bones. The silvery dust at his feet swirl, lifting in a vortex that defied the lashing rain. The hum became a deafening roar inside his skull. Panic shot through his numbness, and he tried to pull back, but his hand was fused to the metal.
He watched, detached, as the grey substance seeme up over his skin, encasing his fingers, his wrist. It was not painful, but a profound, cellular unwinding. The world around him tore apart, and he was pulled through a hole too small, his molecules protesting, stretching, scrambling. Light slammed into him, a solid, blinding wall that left him reeling. He had a fleeting memory of the operating theatre, the moment the aneurysm had let go, a catastrophic, interior sunburst. Then, nothing.
Consciousness returned, and with it, pain. A deep, musculoskeletal agony, as if every joint had been dislocated and poorly reset. Alistair was lying on his back, the surface beneath him like coarse sand mixed with slittle hard nodules. He opened his eyes to a sky that was an offense, a sickly, bilious green that seemed to clinappeared toskin like a bad omen. A sun, too large and pallid, hung in a haze of ochre clouds, casting a wan, shadowless light that made everything look both lurid and drained.
The air was thick, hot, and carried a scent he could not immediately place – ozone, yes, but underneath it, the coppery tang of blood and the sweet, cloying smell of overripe fruit. Alistair gasped, and the air scraped his throat. He tried to sit up, his surgeon's mind automatically running a diagnostic: possible rib fractures, severe dehydration, shock, probable retinal damage from the light.
The chanting began, a low, guttural drone that seemed to coll around him. Alistair managed to push himself up onto his elbows, the world tilting nauseously. Figures knelt in a rough circle around him, perhaps a dozen, their faces hidden in the shadows of their hoods. They were robed in coarse, undyed fabric, stained with earth and other substances. He was on a plain of cracked, greyish earth, dotted with sparse, thorny vegetation that glistened with a sticky, black resin. In the distance, jagged, purple-black mountains clawed at the green sky.
The arch was gone, but a single word hung in the air, a title, a prayer, an indictment. Mender. Alistair stared at his own clean, empty hands, feeling the weight of their expectation. He opened his mouth, a refusal forming on his tongue – I can't, I'm not, you're wrong – but a man with milky eyes lurched forward, his scarred hand closing around Alistair's wrist.
The touch was a brand. Not of heat, but of a sudden, violent inversion. The gritty wind, the aching sky, the chorus of desperate faces—it all bled away, replaced by a single, searing vision that was not his own: a sterile white room, the whir of a bone-saw, his own hands, steady and gloved, holding a gleaming prosthetic limb. The image was overlaid with a profound, soul-deep gratitude that was not his feeling, but the leather-faced man’s memory.
He was not just being asked to mend. He was being recognized.
As the vision shattered, the man released him, weeping openly. But Alistair’s gaze was locked on his own traitorous hands. For in the fleeting echo of that memory, they had not useless. They had felt…knowing. The hope in the circle solidified into a terrifying certainty. They hadn’t found a stranger. They had found the specific man whose face they remembered from a miracle performed in another world. And that meant his arrival here was no accident. It was a homecoming he could not recall, for a purpose he had already begun.
