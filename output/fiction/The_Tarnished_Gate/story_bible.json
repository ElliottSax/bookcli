      "role": "Protagonist",
      "description": "A brilliant, intuitive cardiovascular surgeon in his late 40s, disgraced after a high-profile malpractice case. Pragmatic, observant, and haunted by a failure he cannot understand. In the Withering Realms, his medical knowledge becomes a unique form of magic.",
      "arc": "From a healer who has lost his purpose to a man who finds a new, greater one. Learns to see 'patients' not as bodies but as integrated systems (world-as-body). His journey culminates in the ultimate sacrifice: using the last of his life and the petrifying curse to become a permanent anchor for the healing world, rejecting a return home."

      "description": "A Mycelian scout from the Withering Realms. Her people are symbiotic with fungal networks, acting as the realm's immune system. She is fierce, desperate, and sees in Alistair the 'bone-deep surgeon' prophesied to diagnose the world's sickness.",
      "arc": "From a desperate believer in a shaky prophecy to a leader who helps forge a new, practical hope. Learns that salvation requires not just a chosen one, but collective action and sacrifice."

He has since become a parasitic deity, believing his control is necessary order. He manifests as a figure of shifting stone and searing light, a personification of a rigid, controlling pathology.",
      "arc": "Represents the ultimate medical antagonist: a well-intentioned but metastatic force. His arc ends not with redemption, but with excision\u2014he is 'operated' on and dismantled by Alistair, his energy returned to Lumen."

  "plot_summary": "Disgraced surgeon Alistair Finch is summoned through the Tarnished Gate by Elara to a dying fantasy world. Its ailment is not a dark lord, but a systemic sickness: the world's magical Heart is corrupted by a parasitic entity, the Usurper. Alistair's medical expertise allows him to diagnose the realm as a colossal patient. Rejecting brute force, he leads a quest to the Heart's core\u2014the Spire of Convergence\u2014conceptualizing the journey as a surgical procedure. He must navigate the world's failing 'organs' (political, ecological, magical) and confront the Usurper, who sees his own parasitic control as necessary medicine. In a final confrontation, Alistair performs a metaphysical 'surgery' to separate the Usurper from the Heart. He succeeds, but is mortally wounded and petrified by the unleashed energies. With the Gate cleared and the world healing, Alistair makes his final choice: instead of returning home, he uses his last moments to anchor himself in the new world's soil, becoming a stone marker from which the first new life sprouts\u2014completing his arc from healer of bodies to foundational part of a world's rebirth.",
