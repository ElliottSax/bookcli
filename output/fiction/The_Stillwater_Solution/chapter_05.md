Chapter 5: Blueprints and Blind Spots

Chapter 5: Blueprints and Blind Spots

The silence in the study was no longer empty. It was now a held breath, thick with the dust of decades and the phantom scent of old violence. Elara’s world had telescoped down to the grain of the oak floorboards, the minute cracks in the plaster, the faint, persistent chill that appeared to emanate from the walls themselves. Her forensic examination had yielded nothing modern—no convenient fibres, no stray hairs preserved in the tomb-like air. The room had been sanitized by time and, she suspected, by careful human hands. The only evidence was the evidence of absence, and the screaming contradiction of the diorama.
Frustration was a cold stone in her gut. The surviving members of the Stillwater (a remote, rain-swept town in the Pacific Northwest) Circle—Alistair Vance, the retired barrister; Beatrice Crowe, the reclusive botanist; and Julian Thorne, the once-charismatic lecturer—had been like fortresses. Polite, impeccably rehearsed, and utterly impenetrable. Their collective amnesia about the night of the murder was a wall she couldn’t scale. She needed a new angle, a crack in the manor’s own skin.
Her grandfather, Elias, had been an architect of spaces, not just buildings. He thought in three dimensions, in load-bearing and light, in public façades and private retreats. If he had a secret, it wouldn’t be in a ledger or a letter. It would be in the bones of the house.
The library was her next best hope. A vast, two-storey cavern of leather and vellum, it held the collected obsessions of generations of Stillwaters. It was here Elias had kept his professional archives. The task was monumental. Blue tubes and flat cardboard portfolios were stacked in a deep, shadowed alcove, smelling of must and blueprint ammonia. For two days, Elara lived in a cloud of that scent, her fingers growing grey as she unrolled plans for municipal buildings, country homes, and unrealized civic projects. She found the original, grand plans for Stillwater (a remote, rain-swept town in the Pacific Northwest) Manor, signed by the famed architect his grandfather had hired. They were beautiful, useless things.
It was on the third day, her neck aching and eyes gritty, that she noticed the anomaly. A set of shelves at the very back of the alcove held not portfolios, but oversized folios of botanical prints. One, a heavy volume on The Ferns of the British Isles, seemed incongruously thick. She pulled it down, its weight surprising her. The spine was tight, the pages seemingly fused. But when she laid it flat on the mahogany table, the light caught a hairline fracture along the gilt edge. Not a book at all. A box.
Her heart thudded against her ribs. Using the blade of her utility knife, she carefully pried at the seam. With a soft, protesting sigh, the ‘pages’—a solid block of paper with a cavity carved out—parted from the cover.
Inside, nestled in a bed of faded velvet, lay a single, tightly rolled sheet of drafting linen. She lifted it out with reverent, trembling hands, using brass weights to pin its corners flat.
This was not the pristine official blueprint. This was a working drawing, marked with Elias’s own precise, minuscule hand. It was a detailed sectional cutaway of Stillwater (a remote, rain-swept town in the Pacific Northwest) Manor, but it was altered. In red ink, fine as spider silk, he had overlaid his own modifications. A network of subtle additions: a shallow compartment behind the headboard in the master bedroom; a false bottom in a window seat of the morning room. And one more significant, more structural change.
A vertical line, dashed in red, ran like a slender artery from the deepest sub-basement, up through the interior walls, bypassing the study’s west wall, and terminating in a cramped space beneath the attic eaves. He had labelled it in his shorthand: ‘Thermal Chimney – Vent. Tested. Functional.’

A thermal chimney. A passive ventilation shaft using convection to draw air through the house. Common enough in old, grand homes. But this one, according to his notes, had an access point. A ‘maintenance panel’. Its location was marked with a small ‘X’ on the study’s west wall, the wall shared with the library.
Elara left the library at a run, the blueprint clutched in her hand. In the study, she went straight to the west wall. It was covered in floor-to-ceiling oak panelling, dark with age and wax. To the casual eye, it was seamless. She began at the corner, running her fingertips over every join, every carved ridge. She pressed, she tapped. The sound was uniformly solid for twenty minutes of meticulous search. Then, near the baseboard, just behind where the old leather armchair had always sat, her nail caught. Not on a ridge, but in a valley—a line so perfectly aligned with the wood grain it was invisible until you traced it. A vertical seam, then a horizontal one, forming a rectangle about two feet high and eighteen inches wide.
A panel. Her breath fogged the polished wood. She tried to get her fingertips into the seam, to pry, but it was too tight. She used the flat of her knife blade. It slid in a millimeter, then stopped. She tried different angles, different pressures. Nothing. It wasn’t stuck; it was locked. Or barred. From the other side.
The realization was a physical shock. The access wasn’t from the study. Elias had designed it to be opened from within the shaft itself. A safety feature? Or a way to ensure only someone who knew the other entrance could use it?
The other entrance. The blueprint showed the shaft passing behind the library, too. But no access was marked there. She stared at the red ‘X’ on the study wall, then at the key she now always carried in her pocket, its weight a constant reminder. The non-mechanical key. The one that fit no lock she could find.
Its shape was unusual: a long, slender stem with a complex, asymmetrical head of swirling filigree. She had assumed it was a decorative lift-key for a clock or a music box. Now, she looked at the study’s panelling, the library’s shelves, with new eyes. It wasn’t a key for a lock. It was a key for a mechanism.
She returned to the library, not to the alcove, but to the main room. She studied the walls. The ornate plasterwork, the carved oak, the sconces. Her gaze swept over the towering shelves, the ladder on its brass rail. And there, above the marble fireplace, set into the mantel’s overmantel, was a large, intricate piece of carved oak filigree. A centrepiece. It was floral, abstract, a tangle of wood ivy and acorns.
She climbed onto the solid mantelpiece, ignoring the soot that smudged her trousers. Up close, the carving was dusty, neglected. But in its centre, a particular swirl of wood, an acorn nestled in a cluster of leaves, looked… separate. She pulled the key from her pocket. The filigree head was a mirror image, a negative space. Her hand steady, she fitted the metal key into the wooden pattern. It slid into the crevices perfectly. A click, felt more than heard, travelled up the stem.
She turned it clockwise. Nothing. Anticlockwise. A deep, reluctant thunk resonated within the wall, a sound of long-disused machinery engaging.
To her left, a section of floor-to-ceiling bookshelf—three feet wide—swung inward an inch, with a sigh of releasing pressure. A breath of air, stale and cold and carrying the distinct, mineral smell of undisturbed stone, washed over her.
Elara stepped down, her legs unsteady. She approached the gap. It was dark. Impossibly dark. She fetched her powerful torch from her kit. Its beam cut into the blackness, illuminating not a room, but a vertical shaft. The walls were rough, unfinished stone, about two feet apart. Iron rungs, rusted but solid-looking, were set into one side, vanishing upwards into shadow and plunging downwards into deeper black. The thermal chimney.
This was it. Elias’s secret. A hidden highway through the heart of the house.
The claustrophobia was immediate and potent, a weight on her chest. But beneath it thrummed a fierce, electric clarity. She slipped the torch’s lanyard around her wrist, took a deep breath of the library’s tame air, and stepped into the wall.
The world changed. The spacious, intellectual grandeur of the library vanished, replaced by a primal, crushing narrowness. The stone was cold and damp against her shoulders. The only sound was the ragged echo of her own breathing and the scuff of her boots on the rungs. She went down first, reasoning the basement might hold more answers.
The descent was a journey into the earth’s gut. The air grew colder, damper. After what like an eternity, her foot met not another rung, but dirt. The basement level. The beam of her torch showed a small, spherical chamber no more than five feet across, the shaft continuing up into darkness above her. In the wall facing the direction of the study, she saw it: another panelled door, identical to the one she’d found but couldn’t open. On this side, however, there was a simple, stout wooden latch. She lifted it, pushed. The panel swung open smoothly, silently, revealing the back of the study’s oak panelling from the inside.
She was behind the wall. In the study, the grey afternoon light filtered through the windows. She could see the room, distorted by the narrow crack of the open panel. This was the blind spot. A person could stand here, unseen, and watch. Or listen. Her skin crawled. Had someone stood here that night? Had they watched Leo Caster drown?
She closed the panel, the latch a soft, definitive snick in the utter silence. The truth close enough to touch, cold as the stone around her. She climb, the torch beam jittering on the walls. Past the ground floor library entrance, past the first-floor bedrooms, up into the narrowing throat of the house. The air grew slightly warmer, drier. She finally emerged into a low, triangular space beneath the steep pitch of the attic roof. Cobwebs hung like ghostly banners. And here, in the dust of decades, was a different story.
The floor was not undisturbed. A clear path had been swept through the grime, leading to a tiny, makeshift nest: a faded cushion, an empty, old-fashioned ceramic water jug, a tin plate. And a stack of books. She shone her light on the spines. Principles of Structural Engineering, The Anatomy of Melancholy, The Complete Works of John Donne. Elias’s books. This wasn’t simply a secret passage. It had been a hiding place. A refuge.
In the corner, beside the cushion, something glinted. She knelt, brushing away dust. It was a small, brass-housed magnifying glass, the kind used for reading fine print. And next to it, a single, spent.32 calibre cartridge case.
The world tilted. The diorama’s lie. The sealed study. The hidden witness. The cartridge case, up here, where someone had waited, had listened, had read by candlelight. The pieces didn’t form a picture yet, but their shape was terrifying.
A sound froze her blood. Not from the shaft. From below.
The distinct, shuddering groan of the library bookshelf swinging shut.
Then, footsteps. Not on the rungs. On the library floor, directly below her hiding spot. Heavy, deliberate. They stopped.
A voice, muffled by stone and wood, but chillingly clear, floated up the shaft. It was Alistair Vance’s voice, stripped of its polite veneer, cold and hard as the foundation stone.
“I told Julian she was too much like Elias. Poking at things. Now she’s in the walls.”

A second voice, lower, grimmer. Julian Thorne. “The key was always the risk. He must have left it for her.”

“It ends tonight,” Vance said, his tone leaving no room for argument. “The same as the painter. An accident in the old house. She’s been unstable since she arrived.”

The footsteps moved away. A door clicked shut.
Silence rushed back in, absolute and suffocating. Elara was trapped in the stone throat of the house, the only way out leading to men who had just sentenced her to a carefully staged death. The thermal chimney was no longer a secret passage. It was a tomb.
And from the darknes merely st below her, where the shaft passed the study, she heard a new sound: a slow, grating scrape, as of something heavy being dragged across the floor. Positioning something beneath the panel. Waiting.
