Chapter 6: The Chimney

The silence of Stillwater Manor was not an absence, but a presence. It lived in the pores of the limestone, in the sigh of settling floorboards, in the slow, cold breath that seeped from the library’s forgotten corners. For three days, Elara had been dissecting that silence, treating the study not as a shrine but as a cadaver. Her tools were not a pathologist’s scalpel and saw, but a soft-bristled brush, a high-lumen angled torch, and sheets of electrostatic film. She had mapped the room in quadrants, a forensic cartographer charting a continent of dust.

But the results told her nothing. No strange fingerprints on the bookshelf edges or the desk’s underbelly—only the smudged ghosts of her grandfather’s own hands, preserved under a patina of decades. No traces of blood, no chemical residues beyond paper, ink, and old wax. The room was a perfect, dusty diorama of a life interrupted, and it gave no clue about the interruption itself.

Her interviews with the surviving Stillwater Circle had gone the same way. Dr. Alistair Finch, the botanist, now kept to his greenhouse, his hands trembling as he repotted orchids. He spoke in clipped, botanical metaphors that avoided the human root of things. “Some ecosystems appear stable, my dear, while a silent blight consumes them from within. Best not to disturb the soil.” Helena Vance, the historian, had peered at Elara over half-moon spectacles with the chilly assessment of an archivist reviewing a dubious source. “Arthur was a man of structure. He built his own maze. Perhaps he simply got lost in it.” Each conversation was a door politely, firmly closed.

The only real progress had been in the plans. Arthur Laughlin’s architectural drawings, kept in a flat file in the damp basement, were things of beauty—precise, inked lines on yellowing linen. They were also lies. By comparing the drafted elevations to the actual dimensions she painstakingly measured with a laser distancer, Elara found the discrepancies. Gaps. Swallows of space within the thick manor walls, unaccounted for in the official record. Her grandfather had built secrets into the bones of his home.

The most tantalizing was in the western wall of the study, next to the fireplace. The plans showed a flue for the hearth, and a secondary, narrower chase for a long-disused stove pipe from an earlier era. But the measured thickness of the interior wall against the exterior stone suggested a cavity nearly eighteen inches wide. A cavity that, according to the plans, shouldn’t exist.

She figured the access wasn’t from the study. It was from the servant’s stairwell on the floor below, a cramped, twisting passage now used only for storage. There, behind a stack of broken hurricane lamps and a rolled, moth-eaten tapestry, was a panel of wood so plain it was conspicuous. No molding, no latch. Just a slight, dark line in the shape of a tall, slender rectangle.

Elara worked.
