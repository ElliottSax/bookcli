Chapter 8: Rats in the Labyrinth

Chapter 8: Rats in the Labyrinth

The air in the Catacombs was not still. It moved, a slow, cold exhalation from the belly of Paris, carrying the taste of wet limestone and the profound, granular silence of six million dead. Léo’s world had shrunk to the tremble of his torch beam over stacked femurs and grinning skulls, a curated hell stretching into blackness. His own breath was a roaring thing in his ears. Up there, the city was hunting him. Down here, only the damp hunted, seeping into his bones, into the leather of the satchel slung across his chest. The satchel that held the ledger.

It wasn’t a book. It was a millstone. He’d learned that in the frantic hours after fleeing La Veuve’s crimson parlour. The names inside weren’t just politicians and industrialists; they were the load-bearing walls of the Republic. And he, a cracked safecracker with trembling hands, had somehow become the demolition charge.

The hideout was an old catiche used by his uncle, a man who’d cracked bank vaults with a stethoscope and a smile. A niche behind a false wall of tibias, containing a rusted camp bed, a crate of vintage bottled water that tasted of dust, and a chemical toilet that soured the already sepulchral air. Léo sat on the cot, the ledger open on his knees. He didn’t read the entries anymore—the sums, the code names, the annotations of favours granted and sins erased. He traced the embossed cover with a dirty thumb. La Veuve’s revenge. She hadn’t wanted to spend the money. She’d wanted to light the fuse and let the whole corrupt edifice burn. And she’d used his crew as the match. Dupont, with his easy laugh, shot through the throat in the mansion’s gilded hallway. Sophie, who could dance on a laser grid, silenced by a bullet meant for him. Their faces flickered in the torchlight, superimposed on the skulls.

A sound. Not from the tunnels. From above. A faint, rhythmic shudder through the rock. Footsteps. Too heavy, too many. Rocher’s men. The butcher’s bill for the massacre at the mansion was coming due, and Rocher was collecting in blood. Léo snapped the ledger shut, killed the torch. The darkness was absolute, a physical weight. He heard his own heart, a trapped bird against his ribs. The vibrations faded. They were searching, a pack of hounds in the labyrinth, but the Catacombs were a liar. They’d be back.

He couldn’t stay. The catiche was a tomb waiting for a body. He had other holes, deeper, more forgotten. Abandoned Metro stations, service tunnels that smelled of ozone and rat piss. A rat’s itinerary for a rat.

He moved at what passed for night in the underworld, guided by memory and a penlight taped to throw a sickly blue beam. He surfaced in the 13th arrondissement, through a maintenance hatch that groaned like a dying man, into the predawn gloom of a loading dock. The air, thick with diesel and rotting vegetables, was shockingly alive. He was heading for the tunnels beneath the Marché d’Intérêt National, the massive wholesale market at Rungis—a maze of its own, where he knew a fence who might, for a catastrophic price, provide false papers.

He never made it to the fence.

The market was a cathedral of commerce under agonizingly bright neon strips that bleached colour from everything. Towers of cauliflower gleamed like alien brains; crates of oranges were pools of violent, unnatural orange. The noise was a constant, low roar—forklifts beeping, stallholders shouting, the wet thud of meat being cleaved. Léo kept to the edges, head down, the satchel a lead weight against his hip.

He saw the first one by the fishmongers. A hulk in a leather jacket too tight for his shoulders, staring with blank intensity at the crowd, a mobile phone pressed to his ear. Rocher’s enforcer. Léo melted behind a pallet of dripping ice, heart hammering. He backtracked, slipping into a narrow alley between warehouses stacked with wine crates.

They were waiting for him there.

Two of them. Not Rocher’s brutes. These were different. Sleek. One man, one woman, both in dark, expensive-looking casual wear that seemed to absorb the garish neon. They stood perfectly still, blocking the alley’s exit to the street. The man had the calm, empty eyes of a surgeon. The woman offered a thin, professional smile.

“Léonard Verne,” the man said. His voice was quiet, devoid of accent or emotion. It cut through the market din like a scalpel. “We’d like to talk about your recent acquisition.”

Léo’s hand went to the satchel. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“The ledger,” the woman said. Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. “You have something that doesn’t belong to you. It belongs to the State. Its publication would be… destabilizing. A national tragedy.”

“A tragedy for who? The people in it?”

The man took a step forward. “For everyone. For the markets. For social cohesion. For your sister, Amélie, and her two little girls in Lyon. They’re so lovely in their school photographs.”

The air left Léo’s lungs. The threat was delivered with the flat cadence of a weather report. They hadn’t chased him through the Catacombs. They’d simply looked at his life, found the softest parts, and pressed.

“You’re not police,” Léo breathed.

“We are the solution,” the woman corrected. “Give us the ledger. Walk away. Your record disappears. A substantial cash deposit appears in an account of your choosing. You can visit your nieces. This ends now.”

It was the clean way out. The velvet-covered exit. He saw it: a quiet apartment somewhere, the gnawing fear gone, Amélie’s relieved smile. But he also saw Dupont’s surprised eyes as the life left them. Heard Sophie’s final, wet gasp. La Veuve’s cold fury. The ledger wasn’t just names; it was the reason they were dead. It was the rot.

“Go to hell,” Léo whispered.

The man’s expression didn’t change. He gave a slight nod. From behind a stack of crates, a third figure emerged—Monsieur Rocher himself, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit, his face a mask of cold fury. Flanking him were three of his foot soldiers, their bulk making the alley seem smaller.

“These gentlemen have a more traditional claim,” the government man said, taking a neat step back, blending into the shadow. “We’ll leave you to discuss it. The offer stands, Léonard. Until it doesn’t.”

The sleek pair vanished as if they’d never been. The market roar rushed back in. Rocher stepped forward, cracking his knuckles. The sound was like breaking twigs.

“You cost me a fortune, you little shit,” Rocher said, his voice a low gravel. “You got my men killed. And you took what was mine.”

“It was never yours,” Léo said, backing up. The wall was cold against his spine.

“Everything in that house was mine!” Rocher spat. “The deal was with the widow. You were the help. Disposable help.”

One of the foot soldiers lunged. Léo ducked, driven by a raw survival instinct he didn’t know he still possessed. He grabbed a loose bottle from a crate and smashed it against the wall. The jagged end glittered under the neon. The man hesitated.

Rocher sighed, a sound of profound disappointment. He drew a pistol from inside his jacket, a sleek, black thing. “Enough. The book. Now.”

A forklift beeped loudly at the alley’s entrance, its light sweeping across them. In that split second of distraction, Léo acted. He hurled the broken bottle not at the men, but at the towering stack of wine crates next to Rocher. It shattered. The top crate teetered, then fell.

Chaos. Crates exploded on the concrete, a wave of red wine and shattered wood. Rocher shouted, stumbling back. A foot soldier was knocked down by the deluge. Léo ran, not towards the street, but deeper into the warehouse, slipping on the river of wine that now flowed through the alley, smelling of oak and iron.

The chase was on. It was brutal, primal. He heard their shouts, the smash of produce as they ploughed after him. He vaulted over a stall of mushrooms, slid across a floor slick with fish guts, the satchel pounding against his side. A bullet whined past his ear and buried itself in a giant wheel of cheese. He didn’t look back. He found a service stairwell, plunged down into the bowels of the market, into the delivery tunnels where the real rats lived.

He lost them in the maze of dripping pipes and shuttered loading bays. He collapsed behind a dumpster, his breath sobbing in his throat, the cloying sweet-rotten stench of garbage filling his nose. He was coated in wine, fish slime, and fear. The sleek ones knew his family. Rocher wanted him dead. There was no underworld left to hide in. They were both above and below.

The ledger. It was the only thing anyone wanted. It was also the only weapon he had.

The idea, when it came, was born of utter despair. He couldn’t sell it. He couldn’t surrender it. But he could use it. Not as blackmail—that was a death sentence. He could publish it. Burn the whole house down, just as La Veuve intended. Make it so public that killing him would be pointless. It was the nuclear option. It would make him the most wanted man in France by everyone with a title or a bank account. But it was the only exit that wasn’t a shallow grave or a velvet-lined cell.

He needed a messenger. A journalist. Not the hungry, corrupt ones who traded in leaks for access. He needed one of the old, stubborn kind, the ones with ink in their veins and a pathological distrust of power. There was only one he’d ever trusted, a man who’d written a fair piece about his uncle years ago, a man known for being unbreakable: Julien Mercier.

Finding a working public phone in a city of mobiles was a journey in itself. He finally found one, a relic of glass and metal, in a quiet, rain-slicked square near Place d’Italie. The booth stank of urine and damp metal. The world outside was a grey blur through the streaked glass. He fed it all the coins he had, his fingers numb and clumsy.

He dialled the number for Le Monde from memory, asked for Mercier. The transfer seemed to take a century. Each ring was a hammer blow. Finally, a voice, rough with age and cigarettes.

“Mercier.”

“Julien. It’s Léo. Léonard Verne. My uncle was—”

“I remember.” The voice was instantly alert, cautious. “You’re in a lot of trouble, son. The kind that gets people killed.”

“I have something. A ledger. Names. Payments. It goes to the very top. Of everything.”

A pause. Léo could almost hear the old journalist’s mind working, the instinct warring with the danger. “Where are you?”

“It doesn’t matter. I can get it to you. But you have to run it. All of it. No compromises. You burn it all down.”

Another, longer pause. Léo pressed his forehead against the cold glass. He saw a black sedan slide to a halt at the far end of the square. No lights. The doors opened. Two sleek figures emerged. Not Rocher’s men. The clean ones.

“Léo,” Mercier’s voice was tight, urgent. “Listen to me. Don’t go to your sister’s. Don’t use your cards. They’re monitoring—“

And then Léo heard it. A faint, but unmistakable click on the line. A second, metallic presence breathing with them. The call was already traced. They’d known. They’d let him run, let him panic, let him lead them to the one person he thought was safe. Mercier was compromised, or his line was, or the whole damn world was.

The figures were walking across the square now, unhurried, inevitable.

“Julien?” Léo whispered, the hope draining from him, leaving a cold, fatalistic void.

But the line was dead. The only sound was the hollow, mocking dial tone and the soft, rhythmic click of the trace, counting down the seconds he had left. He looked at the receiver in his hand, a useless piece of plastic. He looked at the two agents approaching, their faces calm and empty in the grey Parisian light. The velvet glove was off. The guillotine, silent and efficient, was here.

He dropped the phone. It swung on its cord, ticking like a metronome. He had nowhere to run. The labyrinth had finally closed its last door. All he had left was the ledger in the satchel, and the certain, crushing knowledge that he was well and truly finished.
