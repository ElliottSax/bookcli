## **Chapter 1: The Last Call**

Absinthe made the world soft and the memories softer. Green-gold liquid swirled in Léo Moreau’s glass, a tiny, toxic galaxy trapped between his fingers. An opalescent cloud bloomed and died, a private, chemical sunset. His third, or maybe his fourth. Count had been lost after the second, when the sharp edges of Le Perroquet Gris—the chipped mahogany veined like a stale loaf, the sticky rings of a thousand forgotten drinks—had blurred into a single, brown impression of failure. The taste was a familiar ritual: the initial, medicinal slap of anise, followed by the creeping, herbal sweetness that promised clarity but delivered only a merciful haze. Parisian soil, wormwood and regret—that was the taste.

A tomb of aspirations, Le Perroquet Gris had found its most faithful mourner in Léo. Nestled in a corner of Montmartre that smelled perpetually of wet stone, stale urine, and the ghost of baking bread from a *boulangerie* long shuttered, the bar served as a cave for those the light of day had scorched. A claustrophobic soup of cheap Gauloises smoke, spilled pastis, and the damp wool of coats that never fully dried hung in the air. Silhouettes hunched over their glasses: artists who’d traded their brushes for the bottle, writers whose only narratives were muttered grievances, and men like Léo—specialists whose specialties had rusted shut. From the far corner, an old man with a face like a crumpled napkin nursed a *vin rouge*, his breath whistling a tuneless dirge. Only the occasional, wet cough from the shadows and the low, constant drip-drip-drip from the absinthe fountain behind the bar—a sound like a slow, leaking heart—broke the silence.

That fountain was the room’s tawdry altar: a pewter contraption with four spigots, crowned by a lumpish, tarnished parrot. Ice water melted from its reservoir, drip by chilling drip, onto the sugar cubes balanced on slotted spoons held over waiting glasses. A theatre of patience, this louche ritual. Léo had dispensed with the sugar tonight. He took his poison straight, no sweetness to cut the bitterness. He deserved it.

His hands rested on the sticky wood, a living map of his career. Long, clever fingers, pianist’s fingers, his father had once said with misplaced hope. Now a slight, permanent tremor—the absinthe’s faithful companion—marred them, along with a knuckle on his left hand a shade thicker and off-kilter from the rest. A souvenir from a startled guard in a Biarritz villa, a panicked swing of a truncheon. Flexing the hand slowly summoned the old, dull ache. *Empty hands*. For over two years, they hadn’t felt the subtle, whispering vibration of a dial finding its true gate, or the satisfying, oiled *thunk* of a lever-tumbler surrendering. Not since the Bernard job. Not since the blood.

Closing his eyes against the greenish gloom only sharpened the memory. Not the vault—the cool, silent darkness, the smell of ozone and polished steel, the beautiful, intricate challenge of the Mosler lock that had sung so sweetly under his tools. No. The man’s face. Not as he was in life—Léo hadn’t known him, just a night watchman named Bernard with a wife and a fondness for fishing, according to the later, tormenting newspaper snippets—but in that fractional, eternal second of impact: the wide, uncomprehending surprise, the terrible, mundane shock of interrupted existence. The sound hadn’t been a dramatic bang, but a flat, wet *pop*, absurdly small for the catastrophe it unleashed.

It hadn’t been Léo’s bullet. Pascal’s, wild and panicked, fired as the man rounded the corner a full thirty seconds ahead of schedule. But the vault had been Léo’s to open, the timing his to command. He’d said it was clean, he’d said the watchman’s pattern was fixed. The failure, therefore, was his. A tenant that paid no rent, the guilt settled deeper into the hollows of his chest with each passing, purposeless day, feeding on the silence and the green liquor.

Gérard, the bartender, a mountain of a man with a wash of faded blue tattoos on his forearms, polished the same glass with a grey rag for the tenth time, his eyes fixed on Léo. “Another, Léo?” he asked, his voice a gravelly rumble. Less a question and more a ritual, a spoken punctuation to the hour.

“Is the parrot grey?” Léo replied, eyes still shut. An old, tired joke between them.

“Grey and thirsty,” Gérard grunted, but he didn’t move to pour. Leaning his bulk on the bar, the wood creaked in protest. “You have a shadow.”

Léo’s eyes opened. The air in Le Perroquet Gris seemed to have thickened further, the usual miasma of despair now charged with a new, watchful tension. The old man in the corner stopped his whistling. From the shadows, the wet cough cut off abruptly. A subtle shift, the instinctive reaction of prey when a new predator enters the clearing.

The door to the street groaned open on its rusted hinges, slicing in a blade of cold, damp night air. It carried the scent of recent rain on cobblestones, of diesel fumes from the boulevard, a shocking reminder of a world outside this stagnant capsule. Silhouetted against the jaundiced sodium glow of the streetlamp stood a figure: tall, impeccably postured, a black cut-out against the urban haze. He didn’t belong. The cut of his charcoal overcoat, the precise angle of his hat—they spoke of the *arrondissements* across the river, of offices with views and decisions that rippled outward.

With a soft, definitive click, the man closed the door, sealing the warmth—and the heightened tension—back inside. He took off his leather gloves, one finger at a time, and tucked them into his belt. Pale, assessing eyes, the colour of a winter sky, scanned the room with methodical disinterest before landing on Léo. Not searching, but confirming. He approached. His shoes, good English leather, made no sound on the sawdust-strewn floor, but his presence was a wave that pushed the stale air ahead of him.

He stopped a precise three feet from Léo’s stool. “Good evening, Monsieur Moreau,” the man said. His voice was a smooth, low tenor, cultured, each word placed with care. He didn’t smile.

*He knows the name. Not a good sign.* Léo’s mind, fogged by the absinthe, scrambled for traction. *Police? Judiciary? No, too polished. Private. Corporate. Or worse—a ghost from the Bernard mess, a relative, a creditor of blood.* He took a slow, deliberate sip, letting the liquid fire burn a path of false courage down his throat. He set the glass down with a soft, definitive click that seemed absurdly loud in the quiet bar.

“Do I know you?” Léo asked, his voice roughened by smoke and disuse. He kept his gaze level, aiming for indifference, knowing he likely projected only weariness.

The stranger’s lips twitched, a minute rearrangement of features that conveyed nothing. “No. But I know of you. Your reputation precedes you.” He said ‘reputation’ like it was a specimen under glass, something to be examined for flaws, not admired.

*Reputation. A polite word for a list of failures that ends with a corpse.* Léo’s thumb traced a slow circle on the damp, cold rim of his glass. “Reputations are for the living. Mine’s retired. It died of shame, quietly, in a place much like this.”

A pause stretched, filled by the incessant, mocking *drip… drip… drip* of the fountain. The stranger finally moved, pulling out the stool next to Léo with a controlled motion. The legs scraped against the floor with a sound like a drawn blade. He sat, not leaning in with false camaraderie, but his focus was absolute, a beam of cold light pinning Léo to his seat. “Retirement is a luxury. One the world rarely grants to men of your… particular talents.” His gaze flicked, almost imperceptibly, to Léo’s hands resting on Le Perroquet Gris (The Grey Parrot) - a seedy, failing absinthe bar.

*Talents. He means the hands. He’s already studied the hands, the map of my past.* A flush of anger, hot and sudden, cut through the absinthe haze. Léo tucked his hands into his lap, a useless, childlike gesture of concealment. “The world and I have an understanding. We leave each other alone. It’s a mutually beneficial arrangement.”

“Understandings can be renegotiated,” the man replied, his tone implying it was a simple matter of paperwork. He drew a crisp, cream-coloured envelope from his inner coat pocket. It was unsealed, the flap tucked in neatly. He laid it on Le Perroquet Gris (The Grey Parrot) - a seedy, failing absinthe bar between them like a chess move. It was pristine, a stark, offensive rectangle of potential against the grimy, scarred wood. “When a unique problem arises, one seeks a unique solution. A key for a specific lock.”

Léo didn’t look at the envelope. He stared at the man’s face, searching for the lie, the trap, the telltale flicker of malice or desperation. *It’s always a trap. The money’s just the bait, the job is the spring, and the consequence is the steel teeth.* “I don’t solve problems anymore. I am a problem. A solved one.”

“This one pays,” the man said, his voice dropping just a fraction, conspiratorial. The word hung in the air, tangible as the smoke. “Enough to forget. To disappear properly. Not…” His gaze performed a slow, deliberate inventory of Léo’s world: the stained cuffs of his shirt, the empty glass, the permanent slump of his shoulders against the weight of the tomb. “…this. This isn’t living, Monsieur Moreau. This is waiting for the end in a poorly lit room.”

*To forget.* The words hooked something deep in Léo’s gut, a sharp, painful tug on a line he thought had long since snapped. *He knows which buttons to push. He’s done his homework, studied the wreckage.* Léo felt it then, beneath the guilt and the fog: the old, cold thrill. The whisper of the puzzle, the silent conversation with metal and mechanism, the pure, abstract challenge that existed outside of morality and consequence. He hated himself for the spark of interest that flickered in his chest. He took another drink, a larger one, draining the glass, letting the fire scour him from the inside.

“What’s the job?” The question left his lips before he could call it back, a low, resigned exhale of words. It was surrender. He saw the knowledge of that surrender reflected in the stranger’s winter-eyes.

The stranger’s expression didn’t change, but something in his posture eased minutely, a hunter seeing the quarry step into the snare. “A box. A very old, very secure box. Seventeenth century, we believe. Italian craftsmanship, possibly from the workshop of a man who made secrets for popes and princes. It is currently in a… a very secure place. It needs to be opened. Quietly. Nothing inside is to be removed. It simply needs to be opened.”

*Opened. Not stolen. Just opened.* The specificity was new, intriguing. It bypassed the messy end of the old jobs—the fencing, the laundering, the running. This was pure mechanics. The tremor in Léo’s left hand intensified. He clenched it into a fist under Le Perroquet Gris (The Grey Parrot) - a seedy, failing absinthe bar, the thickened knuckle pressing white. “Why me? If it’s so old, get a historian with a chisel.”

“Because historians lack finesse. And because they say Léo Moreau could open the door to Hell and persuade the devil to loan him the key, all without waking the dog.” For the first time, a ghost of something—not warmth, but perhaps professional appreciation—touched the man’s voice. He pushed the envelope an inch closer, its edge now almost touching Léo’s empty glass. “All the details are here. Location, security protocols, schedules. Read it. Or don’t. The offer, and the anonymity it currently provides, expires at dawn.” He glanced at a slim wristwatch. “That gives you approximately five hours.”

He stood as smoothly as he had arrived, adjusting the line of his coat. He cast one more look around the tomb of the Grey Parrot, his nostrils flaring slightly as if offended by the very atmosphere. “Good evening, Monsieur Moreau.”

Léo didn’t watch him go. He listened. The almost-silent tread on the sawdust, the groan of the door, the brief, cold sigh of the outside world, the final, metallic *clunk* of the latch engaging. The bar’s stale air rushed back in to fill the vacuum, but it felt different now. It was no longer a blanket of resignation; it was charged, pregnant with a terrible choice. The *drip-drip-drip* of the fountain sounded like a ticking clock.

His eyes, heavy and burning from the liquor, fell to the envelope. It was just paper. It was a grenade with the pin already pulled. It was a door, slightly ajar. For a long minute, he didn’t move. He just watched it, as if it might dissolve into the grime of Le Perroquet Gris (The Grey Parrot) - a seedy, failing absinthe bar top, saving him from the decision.

Gérard lumbered over, picking up the empty glass. “Trouble, Léo?” he asked, his voice low.

“Trouble’s the only thing that still knows my address, Gérard,” Léo murmured.

The bartender grunted. “The good kind or the bad kind?”

“Is there a difference anymore?”

Gérard wiped the space in front of Léo with his rag, a futile gesture. “The money’s always good. The rest…” He shrugged his massive shoulders and moved away, leaving Léo alone with the envelope.

*To forget.* To not see Bernard’s face in the swirl of every absinthe glass. To not feel the phantom vibration of the Mosler lock in his trembling hands. To sleep through the night without the *pop* echoing in the silence. It was a lie, of course. Some things didn’t wash out. But they could be drowned, muffled, pushed into a corner by distance and new walls. This envelope could buy those walls.

Slowly, as if moving through syrup, his hand—the one with the thickened, guilty knuckle—crept out from his lap. His fingers hovered above the crisp paper, trembling not just from the absinthe now, but from the seismic shift this simple act represented. He saw a drop of condensation from his glass had made a tiny, dark star on the envelope’s surface. A mark. A commitment.

*To forget.*

His fingertips touched the paper. It was cool, smooth. He picked it up. It was heavier than it looked, dense with fate. He didn’t open it. Not here, in the tomb. He slid it inside his own worn jacket, the coarse wool scratchy against its pristine surface. The weight of it against his chest felt like the first beat of a new, dangerous heart.

He stood, his legs unsteady, and tossed a few frayed notes onto Le Perroquet Gris (The Grey Parrot) - a seedy, failing absinthe bar. Gérard gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod from the other end, a salute to the condemned or the resurrected, Léo couldn’t tell which.

Pushing out into the Montmartre night was like plunging into a cold bath. The rain had stopped, leaving the cobblestones slick and gleaming under the lamplight, reflecting the bruised purple of the clearing sky. The air was clean, sharp with the smell of wet earth and stone. For the first time in years, Léo didn’t feel like a ghost. He felt seen, targeted, alive with a terrible, humming potential. The envelope burned against his ribs. He turned his collar up against the chill and began to walk, not knowing where he was going, only that he was moving away from the Grey Parrot and towards the precipice described in crisp, cream-coloured paper. The last call had been answered. The game, whatever it was, was on.
