Chapter 12: Finale in Velvet and Blood Chapter 12: Finale in Velvet and Blood The silence of the Palais Garnier was a physical thing. It was the held breath of a thousand plaster angels, the suffocating embrace of velvet drapes, the dense, dusty quiet of a tomb that had forgotten the sound of applause. Léo Moreau moved through it like a rat in the walls, which was, in a sense, exactly what he was. His ribs screamed where Saint-Clair’s men had worked him over on the rooftop. The taste of blood—his own—was a copper penny under his tongue. But the deeper ache was the phantom weight of his daughter’s small body, pressed against him in that fleeting moment of deliverance before he’d shoved her into the arms of a terrified stagehand, a man who owed Léo a forgotten favour from a past life. “The service entrance. Run. Don’t look back.” He hadn’t watched her go. To watch would have been to falter. Now, he was a ghost in the machine of his own demise. He emerged from a service corridor behind the grand tier, the world opening into a cavern of gilded misery. The opera house was a symphony in decay. Moonlight, filtered through the grime of the central dome, fell in sickly shafts, illuminating floating galaxies of dust. It caught the tear-streaked cheeks of cherubs, the tarnished gold leaf of the proscenium arch, the monstrous, crystal-laden chandelier hanging like a frozen explosion over the empty auditorium. The red plush of the seats was the colour of a deep, old wound. A scuff of a shoe, too deliberate, echoed from the vestibule. They were here. First, Roux’s ‘cleaners.’ They entered not with a bang, but with a whisper. Three men in dark, practical clothing, moving with the terrible, synchronized efficiency of surgeons. They fanned out, their eyes—flat and assessing—scanning the shadows. They didn’t speak. Their tools were not for conversation: compact submachine guns, suppressors already attached. They were here to excise a problem. To sterilize the scene. Léo, the ledger, any inconvenient witnesses. They were the final period at the end of a dirty sentence. Léo melted back into the passage hidden behind a statue of Melpomene, the muse of tragedy. His fingers traced the familiar, rough plaster of the secret wall. As a stagehand, a lifetime ago, he’d known every illicit shortcut, every passage built for lovers, spies, and fleeing prima donnas. The Palais was a lie built upon lies, and he was its current, scurrying truth. From his perch, he saw Saint-Clair arrive. The old wolf had shed his politician’s grace. He entered through the royal entrance, flanked by two hulking enforcers whose tailored suits couldn’t hide the animal tension in their shoulders. Saint-Clair himself looked ravaged. His silver hair was dishevelled, his face a mask of furious desperation. The elegant veneer had cracked, revealing the brutal pragmatism beneath. “Moreau!” His voice rang out, a discordant note in the sacred space. It bounced off marble, faded into velvet. “This is tiresome! You have what I want. I have nothing left to take from you. Give me the book, and you can disappear. I’ll even give you a head start.” Léo didn’t answer. He was already moving, crawling through a narrow duct above the foyer du public. The smell was of ancient sawdust and rat droppings. He could hear the cleaners below, their muted communications like the clicks of insects. His destination was the old sound booth, a forgotten cubbyhole at the rear of the balcon. Inside, it was a museum of obsolete technology: a giant, skeleton-key mixing board, spools of tape, a microphone with a fraying cord. And the master switch for the house’s internal radio system, which could, with a little forced rewiring, piggyback onto a public band. He worked in the dark, his hands trembling not from fear, but from a terrible, clarifying fury. He spliced wires, the tiny sparks illuminating his raw knuckles. He plugged in the microphone. It hissed like a waking serpent. Below, the dance of death began in earnest. A cleaner, gliding past the grand staircase, spotted one of Saint-Clair’s men. No challenge was issued. The cleaner’s weapon coughed twice—a sound like someone stamping on two empty cardboard boxes. The enforcer crumpled, a dark flower blooming on his white shirt. The report was shockingly intimate in the vastness. The second enforcer returned fire. The roar of his unsuppressed pistol was a shocking violation, shattering the fragile silence into a million echoing shards. A cleaner spun, hitting the marble floor with a wet thud. the opera house was alive with the staccato language of violence. Muffled thwips from the cleaners’ weapons, the barking retorts of pistols, the spang of bullets ricocheting off gilded columns, the puff of plaster dust as cherubs lost fingers and wings. Léo watched it all as if from a great height, his fingers on the ledger. He opened it, not to the coded entries, but to the plain-language key he’d compiled on the final pages—names, amounts, dates. The who, the what, the when of the city’s rot. He keyed the microphone. The hiss amplified, echoing through the silent auditorium and, he prayed, out onto the police band he’d hijacked. He read. His voice, when it came, was not the thunder of an accuser. It was flat, weary, final. It was the voice of a man reading a eulogy for a living corpse. “Commissioner Arnaud Roux. Two hundred and fifty thousand francs. Payment for the suppression of the Dufour inquiry. May twelfth.” Below, the shooting stopped. A frozen moment. “Deputy Minister Saint-Clair. Four hundred thousand. Recurring quarterly. For procurement overrides and zoning waivers in the fourth arrondissement.” A roar of pure rage from the stalls. Saint-Clair, firing blind toward the sound booth. Bullets punched through the wood below Léo’s feet. “Chief Prosecutor Valon. One hundred and eighty thousand. For the expedited ‘loss’ of evidence in the Lacroix trial.” A new sound entered the symphony: the distant, rising warble of police sirens. First one, then another, then a chorus. They were converging. The broadcast was out. Roux could not block the city itself. Léo kept reading, name after name, sin after sin. He was the town crier of damnation. He saw Roux then, emerging from behind a pillar. The Commissioner had shed his pretense. His face was a stone of lethal focus. He shot not at the booth, but at the source of the speaker wires leading into the walls. The speakers died with a pop and a screech of feedback. The silence that followed was heavier than before, now charged with the approaching sirens. “Enough theatre, Moreau,” Roux’s voice cut through the dark. “It ends on the stage. Where it began.” Léo knew he was right. This opera needed its final act. He clutched the ledger, its leather cover slick with his sweat, and descended. He stepped onto the stage from the wings. The vast, dusty expanse of it stretched before him, the heavy red curtain smelling of mildew and forgotten grandeur. The chandelier hung directly above, its thousand crystals trembling faintly with the vibrations of the sirens now pulsing outside the building. Saint-Clair staggered up the steps from the orchestra pit, his pistol held low. He looked like a deposed king. “You’ve killed us all, you fool,” he spat. “No,” Léo said, his voice hoarse. “You did that years ago. I’m just reading the obituary.” From the opposite wing, Roux appeared. He held his service pistol, steady and professional. The two cleaners flanking him were gone—likely holding the doors against the police. It was just the three of them now, under the grand chandelier. “The ledger, Moreau,” Roux said. His tone was that of a reasonable man discussing a traffic violation. “Give it to me. The police outside are mine. I can still spin this. A tragic incident. A blackmailer’s last stand. Your daughter remains safe. It’s the only deal left.” Saint-Clair swung his gun toward Roux. “You parasite! You think you can carve me out? I built you!” “You built a tool,” Roux corrected, his aim shifting smoothly to Saint-Clair. “Tools get replaced.” Léo stood between them, the worthless prize. He strange calm. This was the heart of it. The corruptor and his executioner, and the man who simply remembered. The velvet guillotine, finally descending. The sirens were at the doors now. Shouts. The pounding of fists on wood. “It’s over, Roux,” Léo replied. “They’ve heard the names. The city has heard.” “The city forgets,” Roux smiled, a thin, cold thing. “It’s what it does best.” In that suspended second, Léo made his choice. He would not let them have it. Not the truth, not the victory, not the narrative. He glanced at Saint-Clair, at the hollow, raging ruin of him. He looked at Roux, the perfect, empty vessel of power. He thought of his daughter, who would hopefully remember a father who tried, at the end, to be clean. With a movement that was almost casual, he tossed the ledger. It spun, a leather-bound bird, over the edge of the stage and down into the dark of the orchestra pit. It landed with a soft, final thud on the dusty floor, between a disused timpani and a cello case. “No!” The cry was torn from both men at once. Roux acted first. His professional clarity assessed the situation: Saint-Clair was the bigger liability, the loose cannon. The ledger was retrievable. The witness was not. He fired. The shot was deafening on the stage. Saint-Clair jerked backwards, a look of profound, almost comical surprise on his face. He clutched at the centre of his chest, where a dark stain rapidly expanded, deeper than the velvet curtains. He didn’t speak. He took one step, then crumpled to the boards, his eyes fixed on the glittering chandelier above. Roux’s gaze snapped back to Léo, but Léo was already moving. He kicked over a heavy prop column, sending it rolling toward Roux, and sprinted for the prompter’s box—a tiny, hidden trapdoor in the stage floor. A bullet whined past his ear. He dropped into the darkness below the stage simply as the main doors crashed in. Shouts, beams of flashlights cutting the gloom, the authoritative bark of commands that were not Roux’s. The under-stage was a labyrinth of ropes, sandbags, and forgotten scenery—a jungle of shadows and cobwebs. Léo moved by touch and memory. He heard the thunder of boots on the stage above, the confused yelling (“Commissioner! Stand down!”), a single, desperate shot from Roux that was answered by a volley from the honest cops who had heard their names on the radio. Léo didn’t wait for the outcome. He found the ancient, disused coal chute that led to the cellars. He slid into the absolute black, down into the cold, earth-smelling darkness. He emerged in a sub-cellar, waded through a subterranean stream that chilled him to the bone, and found the old workman’s exit that opened onto a narrow alley behind the Palais Garnier. He emerged into the pre-dawn. The air was cold and tasted of diesel and coming rain. The alley was empty. Behind him, the opera house was a lit hive of chaos, flashing blue lights painting its ornate walls in strokes of emergency. He was a spectre, soaked in river water and sweat, bleeding from a dozen minor wounds. He leaned against the damp brick, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He had done it. The ledger was in the light. Saint-Clair was dead. Roux was finished. The guillotine had fallen. And he was nothing. A name on a police report, a face in a mugshot, a ghost. He pulled up the collar of his ruined coat and limped into the mist gathering at the mouth of the alley. He did not look back. There was nothing for him there. The city swallowed him whole, just another shadow dissolving in the grey dawn. * In the orchestra pit, a young gendarme, his face pale under his kepi, shone his flashlight on the discarded ledger. He called his sergeant over. Together, theygazedd at the open page, the names etched in Léo’s tight, desperate script. The sergeant, a man with twenty years on the force and eyes that had seen every kind of compromise, swallowed hard. He looked up at the stage, where they were zipping a body into a bag, and where Commissioner Roux was being read his rights in a stunned, flat monotone. “Mother of The sergeant lifted the ledger, its cover still warm. By noon, the names within would scorch the powerful, a cleansing fire Léo had lit. He had vanished into the waking city, a ghost of his former self. The victory was hollow, his old life severed. Yet, as he walked, the weighto shift from the burden of vengeance to the lightness of purpose. He was free, not to return, but to begin.
In the safe house, the girl watched the dawn, the blanket snug around her shoulders. The hot chocolate was sweet, the silence peaceful. She held the photograph, not with desperate hope, but with a quiet certainty. He had told her to be brave. He had promised.
Léo reached the quiet station at the city’s edge. The first train of the day hissed, bound for nowhere anyone would think to look. He boarded, and as the city retreated, he didn't look back at the prison of its making. He peered ahead, to the small, specific future he had bought with his ruin. The truth was out, a giant now walking on its own. His task was smaller, and more profound: to be a man keeping a promise, to be a father again. The world would forget Léo Moreau, and that was the final, precious gift of his sacrifice. For her, he would simply be Papa, coming home at last. And that was the only truth, and the only freedom, he now needed.
