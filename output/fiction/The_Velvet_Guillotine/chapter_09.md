Chapter 9: The Daughter in the Crosshairs

Chapter 9: The Daughter in the Crosshairs

The rain was a greasy film on the window of the phone booth, smearing the neon Tabac sign across the street into a bleeding wound of light. Léo pressed the receiver to his ear, the plastic cold and slick against his skin. The line to Claire’s dormitory room rang for the seventeenth time. He’d been counting. Each tone was a nail hammered into the coffin of his hope.
A click. A voice, young, female, blurred with sleep. “Allô?”

“Claire?” His own voice was a stranger’s, gravel and rust.
“No, this is Sophie. Claire’s roommate. Who is this?”

“Her father. Put her on, please.”

A pause. The muffled sound of a hand over the receiver, then a distant, “Claire, your dad—” Another pause, longer. Sophie’s voice returned, thin and uncertain. “She’s… she’s not here, Monsieur Vernier. She went out last night. With friends, she said. She didn’t come back.”

The world didn’t tilt. It didn’t need to. It had already been upended. This was just the final, sickening slide into the abyss. The receiver like a lead weight. “Did she say anything? Leave a note?”

“No, nothing. Her bed is still made. Her bag is here.” Sophie’s voice dropped to a whisper. “There were men here earlier. Asking for her. They didn’t look like friends.”

Léo closed his eyes. The smell of the booth—stale urine, damp metal, the ghost of a thousand cheap cigarettes—coated his throat. “What did they look like?”

“One was big. Like a bull. He didn’t speak. The other… polite. Too polite. He wore a nice coat. He said they were from the university administration.”

Saint-Clair. And Rocher. They hadn’t come for him. They’d gone around him. They’d found the one load-bearing wall in the ruin of his life and taken a sledgehammer to it.
“Thank you, Sophie,” he replied, the words automatic. “If she contacts you—”

The line went dead with a soft, final click from another extension. They were listening, of course. They were always listening now. He hung up, his breath fogging the glass. His reflection stared back: a gaunt, middle-aged ghost with the eyes of a hunted animal. The ledger, wrapped in oilcloth, was a cancerous weight against his ribs. The wrong prize. The key to a door that opened only onto a deeper, darker labyrinth.
He walked. The rain was a fine, persistent mist that seeped through his coat, finding the seams. Paris at three in the morning was a necropolis of shifting shadows and echoing footsteps. The grand, wide boulevards like canyon traps. He kept to the narrower streets, where the dripping gargoyles and shuttered storefronts offered a perverse kind of companionship in their shared desolation.
He found another phone booth, farther south, near the silent abattoirs of Vaugirard. The coin clinked like a death knell. He dialed the number La Veuve had given him, a line she said was clean, a one-time pulse in the void.
She answered on the second ring. No greeting. “You’ve heard.”

“You knew.” It wasn’t a question.
“I have ears in Saint-Clair’s organization. A maid, a driver. They took her from the library. It was clean. No one saw a thing.” La Veuve’s voice was a dry, clinical scrape. “They will contact you. They want the ledger. It is a simple transaction.”

“Nothing is simple with them. They’ll take the ledger and drop her from a height to make a point.”

“Then you need a lever. You need me.”

Léo leaned his forehead against the cold glass. He could see her in his mind’s eye, sitting in her velvet-draped tomb, her grief a weapon she had honed to a razor’s edge. She wanted to burn the whole corrupt edifice down, and she would use his daughter as kindling if it served her purpose. “You want the ledger for yourself. You’d trade her life for your revenge in a heartbeat.”

A silence, then a sigh that appeared to travel down the wire from another century. “My husband believed in the law. They fed him to the gears of the machine for it. Your daughter is innocent. My war is not with the innocent. But my offer of help is not pure charity, Léo. You know that. Bring me the ledger after. Let me finish what he started.”

“And if there is no ‘after’?”

“Then we will all be ghosts together,” she answered, and the line headed dead.
He had two hours until dawn. The meeting place was a stroke of cruel genius. The Tour Montparnasse, a half-constructed monstrosity of black steel and naked concrete, a skeleton clawing at the Parisian sky. It was a place outside of the city’s laws, a no-man’s-land of wind and vertigo.
He couldn’t go empty-handed. And he couldn’t bring the real ledger. The solution, like everything in his life now, was a flawed, desperate gamble.
The forger, Simone, lived in a cluttered atelier near the Butte-aux-Cailles. The smell of turpentine, linseed oil, and strong coffee hit him like a wall. She was awake, working under a single, brutal lamp, her hands stained with ink and pigment. She didn’t look up as he entered.
“I’m closed, Léo. The world is closed.”

“I need a book.”

“Buy one from the stalls by the Seine.”

“This one needs to be convincing to men who will kill if they spot a single flaw. They will have minutes, in bad light, from a distance.”

Simone finally looked at him, her eyes magnified behind thick lenses. She saw the hollows in his cheeks, the tremor in his hands that wasn’t from the cold. “The child,” she stated.
He nodded, the motion costing him dearly.
She pushed away from her desk. “Describe it.”

He did. The size, the approximate thickness, the color of the aged leather (a deep, bruised burgundy), the style of the gilt-edged pages. The ledger he’d held for only minutes, but its image was seared into his memory—the physical proof of his damnation.
Simone moved with a furious, focused energy. She pulled a blank ledger from a shelf, its cover a dull brown. She mixed powders and liquids, daubing, rubbing, heating the leather with a careful flame until it deepened, cracked, and took on the patina of decades. She flicked ink in a precise spray to mimic foxing on the page edges. She worked in silence, her breath a soft hiss of concentration. It was alchemy under the lamplight, the creation of a sacred, fraudulent relic.
“It will pass a glance,” she said, holding it out as the first grey light touched the skyline. “It will not pass a careful inspection. The paper is wrong. The smell is wrong. It smells of my chemicals, not of old fear and greed.”

Léo took it. It was lighter than the real one. A hollow thing. “It only needs to pass long enough.”

“For what?”

“For me to get my daughter back.”

Simone wiped her hands on a rag, her expression unreadable. “You are a fool, Léo. But so are all fathers.” She didn’t ask for payment. He left, the fake ledger under his arm, a pathetic shield against the coming storm.
The construction site was a kingdom of silence and looming shadows. The fence was a trivial obstacle. Inside, the ground was a frozen mire of churned mud and discarded rebar. The tower itself rose like a black spinal column, its unfinished floors open to the elements, the elevator shafts dark, hungry mouths.
He climb the internal stairs, a spiraling ascent into nothingness. The wind, sharper and colder with every flight, whistled through the steel girders, a mournful dirge. The fake ledger was a dead weight in his hands. His breath came in ragged clouds. The city below slowly revealed itself—a vast, twinkling grid of indifference, its famous beauty rendered abstract and cold from this height.
On the fifty-fourth floor, the stairs ended. The final levels were accessed by a skeletal ladder bolted to the central core. He climbed, the rungs biting into his palms. He emerged onto the raw concrete of the topmost completed floor, a vast, empty plane under the vast, empty sky.
They were there, silhouetted against the pre-dawn bruise of the east.
Claire. His Claire. She was held from behind by the massive bulk of Rocher, one of his ham-like hands clamped over her mouth, the other pinning her arms to her sides. She was wearing the university sweater he’d bought her, a bright splash of crimson against the grey. Her eyes, wide with a terror so profound it had passed into a kind of blank shock, found his across the distance.
Saint-Clair stood a few feet away, elegant and unperturbed in a cashmere overcoat, his hands in his pockets. He looked like a man waiting for a slightly delayed train. And beside him, a figure that sent a different, deeper chill through Léo’s marrow.
Agent Ferrand of the DST, the internal security service. A man with a forgettable face and memorable eyes, like chips of flint. Léo had seen his photograph in the ledger, next to a neat entry detailing a monthly stipend and a code name: Le Gardien. The Guardian. He wasn’t here to negotiate. He was here to ensure state secrets remained state secrets.
“Léo,” Saint-Clair called out, his voice carrying easily on the thin air. “You look like you’ve had a difficult night. You have the item?”

Léo held up the fake ledger. The wind tried to pluck at its pages. “Let her go. Send her to the stairs.”

“First, the murmured,” said Ferrand. His voice was flat, bureaucratic.
“Simultaneous,” Léo said. His own voice sounded raw. “You walk it over. Rocher lets her walk to me.”

Saint-Clair smiled, a thin curve of the lips. “You are not in a position to set terms, my friend. But, as a gesture of goodwill…” He nodded to Rocher.
Rocher removed his hand from Claire’s mouth. She drew in a shuddering gasp. “Papa!”

“It’s alright, Claire. Just walk. Don’t look back. Go to the stairs.”

Rocher gave her a slight shove. She stumbled forward, her legs unsteady. Shto walk across the vast floor, her gaze locked on his. Every step was an agony of slowness.
“Nowwhisperederrand said. “The ledger.”

Léo took a step forward. Saint-Clair matched him. They converged toward the middle, a grotesque parody of a prisoner exchange. Claire passed Saint-Clair, flinching as if his mere presence emitted a cold radiation. Ten meters. Five.
Léo held out the ledger. Saint-Clair took it, his fingers brushing Léo’s. The man’s eyes never left his, a physician assessing a terminal case. He stepped back, opening the cover, his eyes scanning the first page.
Léo reached for Claire. His fingers brushed her sleeve.
“Papa,” she sobbed, collapsing into him. He held her, feeling the violent tremors wracking her frame. He began stay, toward the hatch to the ladder.
“Interesting,” Saint-Clair murmured, not looking up. He flicked a page. Then another. He lifted the book, sniffed the paper. His head tilted. He glanced at Simone’s handiwork, then at Léo, and a genuine, almost admiring smile touched his lips. “Oh, Léo. You tried. You really did.”

Ferrand’s hand went inside his jacket.
“Run!” Léo roared, shoving Claire toward the open hatch.
The first shot was Ferrand’s, a sharp, professional crack that spat chips of concrete from the floor by Léo’s foot. The second came from behind a stack of construction materials—a heavier, angrier boom. Ferrand jerked, a dark flower blooming on the shoulder of his trench coat. He spun, returning fire into the shadows.
La Veuve. She’d come anyway.
Chaosis a fragile, exploding object. Rocher bellowed, drawing a pistol from his shoulder holster. Saint-Clair, still calmly holding the fake ledger, stepped behind a thick concrete pillar.
“Get down!” Léo screamed at Claire, pulling her behind a pallet of cement bags. Gunfire echoed cacophonously in the open space, magnified by the wind. He saw La Veuve then, dressed in black, her face a pale mask of concentration as she fired a revolver from behind a steel girder. She wasn’t aiming at Rocher. She was aiming at Saint-Clair.
This wasn’t a rescue. It was an assassination attempt. He’d been the bait, Claire the incidental casualty.
Rocher’s fire pinned La Veuve down. Ferrand, wounded but functional, was moving with tactical precision, trying to flank her. Saint-Clair watched, a spectator at his own play.
Léo had no gun. He had a daughter clinging to him and a yawning drop on all sides. He saw a length of rusted rebar, thick as a crowbar, lying nearby. He met Claire’s eyes. “When I move, you crawl to that hatch. You go down. You don’t stop. Do you understand?”

She nodded, tears cutting tracks through the grime on her face.
He kissed her forehead, a fleeting touch. Then he moved.
He sprinted, not toward the shooters, but in a wide arc, low and fast. Rocher, focused on La Veuve, didn’t see him until the last second. He tbegan toassive body moving with surprising speed. Léo swung the rebar with all the desperate strength of a condemned man.
It connected with a sickening, wet thud against Rocher’s gun arm. He heard the bone snap. The pistol clattered to the floor. Rocher howled, not in pain, but in rage, and backhanded Léo with his good arm. The world exploded into white light and ringing silence. Léo tasted blood, felt himself falling.
He hit the ground, the wind knocked out of him. Through swimming vision, he saw Claire frozen at the hatch, staring back at him. Go! he tried to shout, but only a wet gasp emerged.
He saw Saint-Clair. The man had discarded the fake ledger. He had drawn a small, elegant pistol from his coat. He was not aiming at La Veuve, who was now trading shots with Ferrand. He was walking calmly toward Léo, his expression one of mild disappointment.
“A forger’s work,” Saint-Clair said, raising the pistol. “I expected more from you, Léo. Sentiment is such a fatal flaw.”

The gunshot that rang out was not Saint-Clair’s.
It arrived from the hatch. Claire stood there, Rocher’s fallen pistol held in both shaking hands, smoke curling from its barrel. Saint-Clair staggered, looking down at the sudden, startling red stain spreading across his pristine white shirt, simply below his sternum. His elegant pistol dropped from his fingers. He looked at Claire with an expression of profound, almost academic surprise, then crumpled to his knees, and onto his side.
The worlto hold its breath. The gunfire stopped. Ferrand, bleeding, stared at his fallen benefactor. La Veuve emerged from cover, her revolver trained on the agent.
Claire dropped the gun as if it were a live serpent, her hands flying to her mouth. Her eyes were huge, not with terror now, but with a horrifying, dawning comprehension of what she had just done.
Léo scrambled to his feet, lurching toward her. He wrapped her in his arms, turning her face away from Saint-Clair’s still form. Over her shoulder, he locked eyes with La Veuve.
Her gaztravelednt from Saint-Clair, to the terrified girl, to Léo. There was no triumph in her face. Only a weary, infinite sadness. She gave a faint, almost imperceptible nod. Then she turned and vanished back into the shadows of the skeletal tower, a ghost reclaiming the darkness.
Ferrand stood alone, clutching his wounded shoulder. Hegazedd at the dead fixer, at the fake ledger lying in the dirt, at the shattered family before him. The state’s secret was safe, in a way. The witness who could authenticate it was dead by an untraceable hand. His mission had collapsed into a morally nullified chaos.
Without a word, he turned and walked stiffly toward the other service stairwell, leaving them in the grim, grey dawn.
Léo held his daughter as she shook with silent, seismic sobs. He looked at the body of Armand Saint-Clair, the elegant architect of ruin, bleeding out on the dirty concrete. The wind moaned through the tower, carrying away the smell of cordite, leaving only the scent of rain, and iron, and cold, empty sky. They were alive. They were together.
And his child, his bright, brilliant Claire, ha merely st crossed a line from which there was no return, her innocence left behind on the floor with a spent shell casing. The ledger was still out there. La Veuve was still out there. The machine Saint-Clair served ground on, oblivious. And they were now, both of them, irrevocably damned.
