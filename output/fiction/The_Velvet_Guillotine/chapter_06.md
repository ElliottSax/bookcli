Chapter 6: The Scarlet Truth

Chapter 6: The Scarlet Truth

The air in the vault, once cool and sterile, turned to soup. It was the smell of cordite, copper, and the sour tang of ruptured organs. Léo’s world had narrowed to a tunnel of screaming noise and strobing muzzle flashes.
It had been silent, a perfect, held-breath silence as Anya’s picks found the final tumblers of the secondary gate. The main vault door, a masterpiece of deception, stood open. Inside, under a single, cold LED bar, sat the objectives: on a velvet pedestal, the Scarlet Tears glimmered with a malevolent, liquid light. And beside it, unassuming and grim, a brushed steel lockbox the size of a large ledger.
Then the world exploded.
The door they’d so delicately bypassed didn’t burst inward; the entire rear wall of the vault chamber shuddered and slid open with a hydraulic sigh. Saint-Clair’s head of security, Rocher, filled the space. He wasn’t a man; he was a geography of violence—shoulders like cliff faces, a neck that swallowed his chin, eyes that reflected the LED light like a shark’s. He held a compact submachine gun with casual familiarity. Four others flanked him, armed and armoured.
“Evening, gentlemen,” Rocher said, his voice a gravelly rumble. “You can leave the Tears. We’ll take the box, too. Saves on cleaning.”

Felix, ever the artist, moved first. Not to fight, but to photograph. His camera, slung low, gave a soft click-whirr. It was an instinct, a final composition. Rocher’s head tilted a fraction. The bullet took Felix in the throat. There was no dramatic spray, just a wet, punctured sound. Felix dropped to his knees, a look of profound surprise on his face, his hands fluttering to his neck as if adjusting a tie. Then he toppled sideways, the camera cracking against the polished concrete.
The firefight was not a duel; it was a slaughterhouse ballet. Anya was already moving, a spectre in black, her small pistol barking twice. One of Rocher’s men grunted, clutching his thigh. She dove behind a server rack as return fire chewed the air where she’d been.
Léo’s own weapon, a sleek 9mm, felt like a child’s toy. He fired, the recoil jarring his wrist, the sound monstrous in the enclosed space. The noise was physical, a pressure against the eardrums, a weight on the chest. He saw Marcel, the old safecracker, try to make for the door, his face a mask of geriatric terror. A short burst from a rifle stitched a line of crimson roses across his chest. He fell without a sound.
Alain. The thought was a spike of ice. Alain was outside, in the van, the getaway man. He’d be hearing this cacophony through the open comms. Léo could imagine him, fingers white on the steering wheel, eyes wide, the panic rising like bile.
“Léo! The prize!” Anya screamed, her voice slicing through the din. She provided covering fire, her shots precise, forcing Rocher to take a step back.
Léo lunged. Not with grace, but with the desperate, scrabbling energy of a rat in a flooding cage. He swept the Scarlet Tears from their pedestal. The diamonds were cold, surprisingly heavy. He shoved the entire nest of them into his reinforced satchel. His eyes fell on the metal ledger box. It was what Rocher had mentioned first. We’ll take the box, too. In a split second, a thief’s calculus: if the monster wants it, it has value. His free hand closed on the handle. It was far heavier than it looked, solid. He wrenched it up.
“No!” Rocher bellowed, the first note of emotion—rage—colouring his voice. The focus of fire shifted toward Léo.
Anya saw it. “Go! The outflow!” She jerked her head toward a grille in the floor at the vault’s rear, their whispered, desperate contingency plan. She threw a small smoke canister. Grey plumes erupted, filling the chamber with a choking, acrid fog.
Léo didn’t hesitate. He owed her his life a dozen times over; one more debt meant nothing. He dropped to the floor, his fingers finding the cold grate. Anya had pre-cut it. A hard kick and it gave way, revealing a yawning, black hole and the distant, echoing sound of rushing water. The sewage outflow for the mansion’s lower levels, leading to the Seine.
He glanced back once. Through the smoke, he saw Anya, a silhouette of fury, exchanging fire with Rocher’s advancing shape. He saw Felix’s still form, one hand outstretched toward his shattered camera. He saw Marcel’s vacant eyes. Then he dropped into the darkness.
The fall was short, into a shallow stream of foul, warm water. The impact drove the air from his lungs. The satchel and the metal box were anchors, threatening to drag him under. He scrambled to his feet, slipping on the slimy concrete channel. Behind and above, he heard Rocher’s roar of fury, then the deafening percussion of gunfire directed down the chute. Bullets sparked and whined off the concrete, one buzzing past his ear like an angry hornet.
He ran, hunched over, the world reduced to the feel of slick stone under his palms, the reek of decay, and the thunder of his own heart. The channel sloped downward. The sound of the Seine grew from a murmur to a roar. A circle of lesser darkness appeared ahead—the outflow pipe, barred with a rusted grate. He hit it with his shoulder, the pain blinding. It held. More gunfire echoed down the tunnel. He could hear splashing pursuit.
Frantically, he edges. The grate was ancient, the river’s corrosion its own locksmith. He braced his back against one wall, his feet against the grate, and pushed with every ounce of failing strength. Muscles screamed in his back and legs. The metal groaned, rust flaking away, then with a shriek of protest, the entire grate tore free and vanished into the black water beyond.
Léo tumbled out after it.
The shock of the Seine in November was a mortal blow. The cold was an electric fist that clenched around his chest, stopping his breath. The current grabbed him greedily. He fought to the surface, gasping, the weight of the satchel and the box pulling him under. He could see the illuminated bulk of Saint-Clair’s mansion high on the bank, windows glowing like indifferent eyes. Muzzle flashes lit the mouth of the outflow pipe. Bullets slapped the water around him, thwip-thwip-thwip, seeking him in the dark.
He didn’t swim; he surrendered to the current, letting it carry him away from the gunfire, kicking only to keep his head above the oily surface. The lights of the mansion receded, replaced by the darker hulks of industrial barges and the skeletal outlines of riverside warehouses. After an eternity, his numb feet brushed against submerged rubble. He clawed his way onto a narrow, garbage-strewn bank, behind a crumbling concrete piling that smelled of urine and dead fish.
He lay there, vomiting river water, his body wracked with violent shivers. The sounds of the city were distant, muffled. Here, there was only the lap of filthy water, the distant moan of a barge horn, and the ragged saw of his own breathing. He was alone. Felix was dead. Marcel was dead. Anya… he didn’t know. Alain had fled; he knew it in his gut. The crew was gone.
The alley reeked of rotting fish and stale urine, a perfume that clung to Léo’s coat like a second skin. He pressed himself against the damp brick, his breath coming in shallow gasps. The distant wail of sirens was growing louder, a chorus of the city’s wrath.
A hand clamped onto his shoulder, and he nearly jumped out of his skin.
“Easy,” Felix murmured, his voice barely audible over the pounding in Léo’s ears. “We’re not out of the woods yet.”

Léo turned, his pulse still hammering. “You could have warned me.”

Felix’s lips quirked, but his eyes were sharp. “Where’s the fun in that?”

Léo exhaled, forcing himself to focus. “We need to move. Rocher won’t stop looking for us.”

Felix crouched behind a dumpster, his camera's viewfinder pressed to his eye. He snapped a few more shots, the city's neon lights reflected in the wet pavement. The sounds of the river lapped against the shore, a soothing melody that contrasted with the chaos of the vault.
He stood, dusting off his pants, and lit a cigarette. The flame cast a warm glow on his face, illuminating the lines etched into his skin. He took a long drag, exhaling slowly as he gazed out at the river.
A figure emerged from the shadows, a young woman with a messy bob and a leather jacket. She slung a backpack over her shoulder and approached Felix, her eyes scanning the area before settling on him.
"You're the one who took the pictures," she said, her voice low and husky.
Felix nodded, taking another drag on his cigarette. "Guilty as charged."

The woman nodded, her eyes flicking to the camera slung around his neck. "You're good. I've seen your work."

Felix raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Where?"

As Felix's eyes met the city skyline, a faint memory of his mother's hands danced across his retina. He recalled the way she'd wrapped his fingers around a cold cup of coffee, the way her eyes had crinkled at the corners when she smiled. He remembered the smell of her perfume, a heady mix of jasmine and sandalwood, and the way it clung to his skin long after she'd left the room.
Felix's gaze drifted back to the river, its surface a dull sheen in the fading light. He thought of his mother's words, spoken in hushed tones when he was a child: "The truth is like a stone, Felix. It's heavy, it's hard, and it's always sinking." He wondered if she'd known, even then, that he'd one day be standing on the edge of this very river, staring into the abyss.
A gentle breeze stirred the water, sending ripples across its surface. Felix's eyes followed the movement, his mind a thousand miles away. He weight of the lockbox, its metal cool against his palm, and the weight of his decision. Was this the stone his mother had spoken of? Was this the truth he'd been searching for all along?
"A few galleries downtown. You've got a knack for capturing the city's essence."

He smiled, feeling feelings of pride. "Thanks. I try to see the beauty in the ugliness."

The woman nodded, her eyes glinting in the dim light. "I know what you mean. I've been capturing the city's underbelly for years."

Felix's interest was piqued. "What do you mean?"

The woman hesitated, glancing around the area before leaning in close. "I mean the things that don't make it into the papers. The stories that get swept under the rug. I've been documenting them, trying to expose the truth."

Felix's eyes locked onto hers, a spark of recognition igniting within him. "I think I know what you're talking about."

The woman nodded, a tiny smile playing on her lips. "I think you do."

As they stood there, the city's sounds and lights swirling around them, Felix felthints off connection to this stranger. They were both seekers of truth, each in their own way. And in that moment, he knew that their paths were about to cross in ways he couldn't yet imagine.
Felix nodded, his camera still slung around his neck, a silent witness to their flight. “The ledger’s heavy. We can’t carry it forever.”

Léo glanced at the worn leather satchel slung across Felix’s chest. “Then we find a place to open it. Somewhere safe.”

Felix’s gaze flicked to the mouth of the alley, where the glow of streetlights painted the pavement in sickly yellow. “Safe doesn’t exist in this city. But there’s a place. A friend of a friend. If we’re careful.”

Léo hesitated. “You trust this friend?”

Felix’s smile was thin, edged with something dark. “No. But desperation makes for strange bedfellows.”

The sirens grew closer. Léo clenched his jaw. “Lead the way.”

Felix turned, his footsteps silent on the wet cobblestones. Léo followed, the weight of the ledger—both literal and metaphorical—pressing down on him. The city loomed above, indifferent, as they vanished into the shadows.
For a long time, he just existed, a piece of refuse washed ashore. The cold seeped into his bones, a deep, permanent chill. Finally, the professional instinct, the thief’s post-operation ritual, asserted itself. Inventory.
With trembling, salt-raw fingers, he unzipped the satchel. The Scarlet Tears were there, a tangled heap of fire and ice even in the dim ambient light. They were worth a kingdom. They were also utterly, irrevocably cursed. He could never fence them. They were a death sentence in gem form.
His hand then went to the metal box, lying beside him in the mud. It was sealed with a simple but robust combination lock, now dripping with river water. He found a chunk of broken brick and, with three blunt, brutal blows, smashed the mechanism. The lid sprang open.
There were no jewels. No bearer bonds. No secret maps.
It was a ledger. A simple, leather-bound ledger, the pages thick and high-quality. It was slightly damp at the edges.
Léo fumbled for a small, waterproof penlight from a pouch on his belt. The tiny beam was a fragile sun in the oppressive dark. He opened the book.
The pages were filled with neat, meticulous entries in black ink. Columns. Dates. Initials. Sums. Not astronomical sums, but significant, regular, businesslike.
05/11 - P. D. - A. - 75,000 - Ref: Tender 44B
12/11 - M. G. - C. - 120,000 - Ref: Zoning Variance 7
19/11 - J. K. - A. - 50,000 - Monthly Retainer

He turned the page. More entries. Different initials. Different references that sounded like government contracts, parliamentary bills, judicial case numbers. He recognized a few. “P.D.” could be Philippe Durand, the Minister of the Interior. “M.G.” was likely Michel Gervais, a media magnate. “C.” as the recipient column appeared again and again.
Saint-Clair’s initial.
Léo’s shivering stopped, replaced by a cold far deeper than the river’s chill. This wasn’t a list of Saint-Clair’s expenses. It was a registry of incomes. Payments received. For services rendered.
He flipped further. The references grew darker. Arms Embargo Override. Prisoner Transfer Cancellation. Witness Disappearance (Marseille). The sums increased. The initials belonged to judges, generals, senior police officials, CEOs of state-controlled industries.
The final pages were different. They contained not payments, but outcomes. Verdict: Not Guilty. Contract Awarded: Delta Corp. Promotion Approved: Colonel V. Article Killed: Le Monde.
Léo closed the book. The penlight beam shook in his hand. The velvety blackness of the riverbank appeared to press in on him, heavy with understanding. He had gone to steal a glittering trinket. He had instead ripped out the country’s still-beating, rotten heart.
The Scarlet Tears were a lure, a decadent symbol. This ledger was the reality. This was the true treasure, the true poison. Saint-Clair wasn’t simply a wealthy pervert; he was the central switchboard in a vast, national machine of corruption. He brokered influence, buried scandals, orchestrated justice and injustice for a price. This book was a map of every compromised hand in France. It was power absolute.
And Rocher hadn’t been trying to protect the diamonds. He’d been sent to secure the ledger. Léo, in his panicked greed, had taken the one thing Saint-Clair could not afford to lose.
He leaned back against the cold concrete, a hollow laugh escaping his chapped lips. He had the means to burn the entire edifice down. He also had a target painted on his back that would make every powerful man in the nation into his hunter. The police, the judiciary, the press—they wouldn’t be seeking a thief. They’d be erasing a mistake.
He thought of Alain, probably hyperventilating in a cheap hotel room. He thought of Anya, dead or captured. He thought of Felix, dying for a perfect shot. They had all been pawns in a game they never understood, their heist a chaotic spark next to a powder keg.
The diamonds in his bag were worthless. The book in his hands was a death warrant. And somewhere in the city, a man named Rocher would be mobilizing not just private security, but every dark lever this ledger controlled to hunt him.
Léo tucked the ledger inside his shirt, against his skin. It like a slab of ice, or a tumour. He stood on unsteady legs, the weight of it bending his spine. He was no longe merely st a thief on the run. He was a secret that had escaped its cage. And secrets this scarlet never stayed hidden for long.
He looked up at the indifferent city skyline, a constellation of false stars. Somewhere out there, a guillotine was being built for him, its blade velvet-wrapped and silent. He had to move. But first, he had to decide: was this ledger a shield, or the one thing in the world worth dying to expose?
The river offered no answer. It just flowed on, carrying the city’s filth out to sea.
