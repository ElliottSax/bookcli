Chapter 11: Setting the Guillotine

Chapter 11: Setting the Guillotine

The air in the attic was a solid thing. It was dust and old wood, the ghost of turpentine, and the sweet, decaying scent of dried lavender sachets stuffed into forgotten corners by Simone long ago. Léo breathed it in, each inhalation a gritty reminder that this pocket of stillness was stolen, temporary. The only light came from a single, dust-caked dormer window, through which the Parisian afternoon bled a tired, grey-gold pallor. It illuminated motes dancing like static, and the sharp, fearful planes of his daughter’s face.

Claire sat on a moth-eaten chaise longue, her knees drawn to her chest. She was too old for the posture, too young for the shadows under her eyes. She watched him, this stranger who was her father, as he knelt on the bare floorboards, the ledger splayed open before him like a dissected heart.

“It’s not just names and numbers, Claire,” he said, his voice a low rasp that seemed to be swallowed by the woolly silence. He traced a column with a grimy finger. “This… this entry here. ‘Project Cerberus. Site Gamma. Disposal via Channel 7.’ Channel 7 was a meat-packing plant in Clichy. They found three workers in one of the industrial mincers. The official report said a tragic accident, a safety failure. It wasn’t. It was a clean-up. Saint-Clair’s people needed the site sterile.”

Claire flinched. Her world had been lectures, student protests, the theoretical corruption of distant men. Not this. Never this.

“And this,” Léo continued, relentless, turning a page that crackled with menace. “‘Roux. Contingency payment. Rue des Rosiers incident.’ That was a bookstore run by a journalist who was asking about defense contract overruns. A gas main ‘explosion’. The journalist, his wife, their two-year-old daughter. Gone. Paid for by the man who sends you birthday cheques, Claire. Your Uncle Armand.”

“Stop,” she whispered, but the word had no force.

“I have to make you understand why I can’t stop,” Léo said, looking up. His eyes were hollows in the dim light. “This book isn’t a scandal. It’s a autopsy of a corpse that’s still walking around, wearing the face of the state. It’s the reason your mother is dead. Not a random break-in. She found a carbon copy of a memo I’d foolishly brought home. She was going to the press. They knew. They made it look like thieves.”

A choked sound escaped Claire’s throat. It was the sound of her past fracturing, the narrative of her life rewritten in blood and ink. The comforting, melancholic mystery of her mother’s death crystallized into a cold, deliberate fact. The grief turned viscous, poisoned.

“Why did you… work for them?” The question was an accusation.

Léo closed the ledger. The soft thud was final. “At first? For you. The schools, the apartment, the future. Then it was because I was good at it. I told myself I was keeping worse men in check, managing the chaos. I was a craftsman. And then… then it was because I was in too deep to see the surface anymore. By the time I saw the ledger for what it was, I was already drowning in it.”

He pushed himself up, his joints protesting. He walked to Simone’s cluttered workbench, a landscape of half-restored porcelain dolls. Their glassy eyes watched, indifferent. He picked up a cheap, disposable phone, the kind you bought with cash from a tabac.

“What are you doing?” Claire asked, her voice gaining a thread of strength, of dread.

“Making sure my death isn’t a full stop,” he said. He dialed a number from memory, each digit a deliberate act of defiance.

The journalist, Moreau, answered on the second ring, his voice tense. “You’re still alive.”

“For now. Listen carefully. I’ve made copies. Digital, physical. They are with… associates. If I do not call this number every twelve hours, starting at 6 PM tomorrow, they will be mailed. Le Monde, Libération, the BBC, the Guardian. The first wave. There are secondaries, tertiaries. You cannot stop the signal, Moreau. Do you understand?”

A long pause. Léo could hear the man’s breath, could almost smell the stale coffee and cigarette smoke through the line. “I understand. It’s a dead man’s switch.”

“Precisely. You’ll get your story. But only if I’m dead. Keep your phone on.” Léo ended the call without a goodbye. The action was clean, surgical. He felt a bizarre, fatalistic lightness. The machinery was now in motion. He had, in essence, already pulled the lever on himself.

He turned to Claire. The hardest part.

“Simone will take you,” he said, his voice softening into a cracked ruin of its former paternal warmth. “Tonight. Somewhere not even I will know. You will not contact me. You will not try to find me. You will become a ghost, until you see the story break. Then you run, and you keep running, and you build a life on the other side of this.”

“No.” She stood up, sudden, tall and furious in the low space. “I’m not leaving you to die in some… some grand gesture!”

“It is not a gesture!” he snapped, the control breaking. The sound was sharp, a gunshot in the claustrophobic attic. The dolls seemed to lean in. “It is logistics! It is the only move left on the board! They have armies, Claire. I have this book and the certainty of my own extinction. Your presence is the only weapon they have left to use against me. By removing you, I remove their leverage. I free myself to act.”

“To die.”

“To finish it!” He grabbed her shoulders, his grip desperate. He could feel the delicate bones, the warmth of her life beneath his stained hands. “Don’t you see? My death has been a foregone conclusion since I took this ledger. The only variable left is what it means. With you safe, it can mean something. It can be a spark. With you in their hands, it is just another quiet, meaningless deletion. Which do you choose for me?”

Tears cut clean tracks through the dust on her cheeks. She didn’t answer. She didn’t have to. The acceptance in her eyes was a colder, deeper hurt than her anger.

Simone appeared at the top of the narrow stairs, a silent wraith. She held a small, worn suitcase. “The car is ready. The safe-house is prepared. No links.”

Léo released Claire. The space between them instantly became a chasm. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, velvet pouch. He pressed it into her hand. “Your mother’s. The earrings she wore on our wedding day. Not for pawning. For remembering. The woman she was, before all this.”

Claire’s fingers closed around the pouch. She looked at him, memorizing the lines of his face, the exhaustion, the strange, grim peace that had settled there. She did not hug him. The moment was too brittle for that. A touch might shatter the resolve they both needed.

“Va-t’en,” he said softly. Go.

She went, following Simone down the stairs into the swallowing dark. He did not watch her go. He listened to the faint creak of steps, the distant click of a door, the muffled sound of an engine fading into the Parisian night. The silence that rushed back in was absolute, and heavier than before. He was alone with the ledger, the dolls, and the ticking clock in his head.

He needed a stage. Not a skyscraper roof, not a anonymous safe-house. A place where the end would have a terrible, fitting poetry. It came to him fully formed, an image from a past life: the Palais Garnier, the old opera house. A decaying monument to grandeur and illusion, a stone labyrinth of gilt and shadow. Roux’s world of old money and older sins. Saint-Clair’s world of hidden power, of things moving in the dark behind the velvet curtain. It was perfect.

The journey there was a phantom’s pilgrimage. He took the Metro, a grey man in a grey coat, the ledger a lead weight against his ribs. He emerged at the Opéra station, the cavernous space echoing with the footsteps of ghosts and late commuters. He used a key he hadn’t touched in fifteen years—a souvenir from a long-ago security consultation for a gala—on a service entrance off the Rue Gluck. The lock turned with a well-oiled sigh, welcoming a ghost home.

Inside, the darkness was profound, a physical substance. The air was cold and smelled of stone dust, old velvet, and the faint, metallic hint of the underground lake that lurked somewhere in the foundations. He moved by memory and the faint, ambient glow of emergency exit signs, their green hue sickly in the void. His footsteps on the marble were swallowed by the immense silence. He passed through the grand foyer, where moonlight filtered through the high windows, illuminating the pale, giant faces of statues. They stared down, frozen in eternal, indifferent song.

He found his way to the auditorium. Pushing through a heavy, soundproofed door, he was met by the breathtaking, empty vastness of it. Thousands of red velvet seats fanned out in silent rows, a plush, waiting audience for nothing. The great chandelier hung like a frozen constellation above, dark and dead. The stage was a black maw, the gilded proscenium arch a giant, gaping mouth.

This was it. The very heart of the illusion.

He chose a seat in the center of the front row, the fauteuil d’orchestre. The plush velvet sighed as he sat. He placed the ledger on his lap. In this colossal space, he felt simultaneously microscopic and gargantuan—the only living soul in a dead world, about to speak the words that would bring the wolves running.

He took out the phone. Two calls.

Armand Roux answered with a banker’s impatience. “This is a secured line. Identify.”

“It’s Léo. I’m at the Palais Garnier. I have the ledger. The original. Come and get it.”

A stunned silence. Then, a low, furious whisper. “You idiot. Do you have any idea the exposure—”

“Midnight, Armand. The curtain goes up at midnight. Bring your cleaners. Or come yourself and we’ll settle our account like the gentlemen we pretended to be.”

He hung up before Roux could reply.

Next, Saint-Clair. The number rang only once.

“Léo. I was beginning to think the rats had gotten you in the sewers.” The Colonel’s voice was calm, amused, the voice of a man who has already written the final report.

“I’m in the main auditorium of the Palais Garnier. The ledger is with me. Your man Roux is on his way. It seems we’re having a final performance.”

The amusement vanished. “A public place? You’re theatrical to the end.”

“It’s not public. It’s a tomb. And I’m the prize in the center. Winner takes all. Or perhaps you’ll just kill each other and save me the trouble. Midnight, Colonel. Don’t be late for your curtain call.”

He ended the call. The silence rushed back, but it was different now. It was a waiting silence. A coiled silence. He leaned back in the velvet seat, the ledger heavy on his thighs. He looked up at the dark, cavernous ceiling, at the murals depicting muses and gods who had long ago stopped listening. He thought of Claire, a ghost in the night, moving towards an uncertain dawn. He thought of Elodie, her laughter lost to the years and the lies. He thought of the names in the book, the ones crossed out in red.

He had set the guillotine. He had placed his own neck beneath the blade. Now, all that remained was for the executioners to arrive and fight over who would pull the rope.

In the profound dark, a single, dry sound echoed: the soft, deliberate turn of a page, as Léo began to read the ledger aloud to the empty, waiting house.

Hook: High above, in the loge du fantôme, a shadow detached itself from the deeper shadows. It had been there, listening, long before Léo arrived. A pair of night-vision goggles was pushed onto a forehead. A soft, radio whisper crackled into the void: "Target is in position. Both parties are confirmed en route. The stage is set." The shadow smiled, a white slit in the dark. "Let the tragedy begin."
