Chapter 2: The Devil’s Bargain

Rain in Paris that night wasn’t romantic. A greasy, persistent drizzle smeared the neon signs of Pigalle into weeping sores of light. It found the back of Léo’s neck, sliding under his collar with the insistence of a cold finger. Durand walked half a step behind him, a silent, broad-shouldered shadow. The man hadn’t spoken since collecting Léo from his apartment, just a curt nod at the door that brooked no argument. Before leaving, Léo had kissed Elodie’s forehead as she slept, the scent of her shampoo—strawberries, cheap and sweet—clinging to him like a ghost. The manila envelope in his inner pocket was a cold brand against his chest.

Turning off the bustling boulevard, they dove into the gullet of a service alley. High, soot-stained walls pressed in, strung with dripping cables and choked with the ghosts of a thousand overflowing dumpsters. Rain slicked the cobbles, turning them into a treacherous black mirror that reflected the fractured glow of a single, buzzing neon sign at the alley’s dead end: ‘L’Ange Perdu’ — The Lost Angel. Its ‘L’ flickered arrhythmically, casting the scene in a stuttering, sickly pink light.

Two figures waited under its glow. Durand melted into the shadows by the alley’s entrance, becoming just another piece of the gloom. Léo walked the final twenty meters alone, the echo of his own footsteps the only sound apart from the rain’s hiss and the electric sputter of the sign.

Beside her stood a man of bulk, a contrast to Durand’s sharp angles—barrel-chested, with a face carved from granite and utterly impassive. But Léo’s eyes slid past him and locked onto her.

La Veuve.

She stood taller than he’d imagined, willowy but with a posture that spoke of steel rebar running down her spine. A tailored black coat, severe and elegant, had its collar turned up against the damp. Hair the colour of polished ash was swept back into a severe chignon. Her face was a study in elegant, ageless austerity—high cheekbones, a blade of a nose, lips a pale slash. But her eyes stopped him cold. The colour of a winter sea under a leaden sky, they held no reflection of the neon’s pink glare, simply absorbing the light, and him, into a depthless chill.

“Monsieur Moreau,” she said. Her voice, lower than expected and smooth as poured slate, carried perfectly in the damp air. “You have reviewed the material?”

Léo’s throat tightened. He gave a short, tight nod. “I have.”

“And?”

“Impossible.” The word burst from him, fueled by a week of sleepless terror. “Saint-Clair? His place is a fortress. It’s not a house, it’s a bank with delusions of grandeur. The security… the personnel. Asking me to crack the safe at the Banque de France during a police gala would be simpler.”

Not a flicker changed La Veuve’s expression. “We are not asking for the Banque de France. We are asking you to open one box. The one you are uniquely qualified to open. The Mosler-Nordstrom ‘Whisper’ Vault, 1974. Serial number prefix MN-W-774-09A.”

Such specificity punched him in the gut. He hadn’t seen the serial number in the blueprints. She knew. She knew exactly why she’d chosen him.

A memory, sharp as broken glass: his father’s workshop, the smell of oil and ozone. The old man, a master locksmith for a discreet firm that served the wealthy and paranoid, had acquired a decommissioned ‘Whisper’ for study. “A mechanical sonnet, Léo,” he’d said, fingers tracing the intricate, silent gear train. “No electronic heart to still. It listens only to pressure, to touch, to the memory in the fingertips.” For six months, sixteen-year-old Léo had taken it apart and reassembled it blindfolded, until its secrets were a map etched into his nerves. Perhaps three people in France knew that. His father was dead. He’d never spoken of it. Yet she knew.

“How?” he whispered.

“A craftsman’s pride leaves traces, Monsieur Moreau. A repaired lock in a museum here, a consultation for a paranoid collector there. The world is smaller than you think for men with such singular talents.” She took a single step forward. Rain beaded on the shoulders of her coat like tiny crystals. “Your assessment of the security is correct, if superficial. Durand has provided the shift patterns, the camera blind spots, the frequency of the patrol barges on the river. The human element is… managed.”

“Managed.” Léo barked a laugh devoid of humour. “You mean bribed or dead. And when the one guard you didn’t ‘manage’ puts a bullet in my head? My daughter becomes an orphan with a pornographic legacy.”

For the first time, something shifted in La Veuve’s eyes. Not warmth, but a spark of cold comprehension. “The threat to your daughter is not from us, Monsieur Moreau. It is the world you have left her in, penniless and vulnerable. We are merely the catalyst of that truth. Succeed, and that threat vanishes. You will have the means to erase her shame and secure her future. A clean slate.”

“And if I refuse? Right now?” He squared his shoulders, the damp wool of his jacket clinging to him.

The granite-faced man shifted his weight almost imperceptibly. La Veuve’s gaze drifted past Léo, back towards the alley entrance where Durand lurked. “Then you walk away. And tomorrow, a curated selection of your daughter’s most private moments begins its journey to the inboxes of her classmates, her teachers, the editorial desk of Le Monde, and the servers of every lucrative, sordid website that trades in such things. The velocity of digital shame is breathtaking, Monsieur Moreau. By this time tomorrow night, ‘Elodie Moreau’ will not be a name; it will be a commodity. A meme. A tragedy.”

Claustrophobia in the alley became absolute. The walls leaned in, the pink neon throbbed in time with his temple. He saw it with horrific clarity.ity: Elodie’s face, not sleepy and sweet with strawberry shampoo, but frozen in a screenshot, pixels of betrayal he had enabled. His failure as a father, quantified, packaged, and broadcast to the world.

“Why?” he choked out. “Why this? Why me? You could hire a team. Blow the damn thing.”

“The vault is in a sub-level, adjacent to Saint-Clair’s private art gallery. Explosives would trigger pressure and seismic sensors. The collection is insured for tens of millions, but the necklace is… unique. It must be retrieved intact, and the vault must appear undisturbed until Saint-Clair next opens it. A ghost must pass through.” She paused, and a smile touched her lips. It was a foreign movement, devoid of any human gladness. “As for the ‘why’… the ‘Scarlet Tears’ is a piece of history. A rather bloody one. Seventeen pigeon-blood rubies, each over ten carats, torn from a Mughal emperor’s crown in the 18th century. They leave a trail of misfortune. Fatal jealousy, bankruptcies, gruesome ends. Saint-Clair acquired it three years ago. Since then, his empire has stagnated. His wife left him. His health is failing. He is a man clinging to a cursed stone, believing it signifies power. We are merely… relocating it to a new chapter of its unfortunate story.”

Léo stared at her. “You want me to steal a curse.”

“I want you to open a box. The curse is incidental.” Her winter-sea eyes pinned him. “The window is four days from now. Saint-Clair will be in Marseille for a shipping consortium meeting. It is the only extended absence he has scheduled in the next six months. The weather forecast predicts a storm. It will mask sound and keep polite society indoors.”

From within her coat, she produced a slim tablet, its screen glowing with a cool, blue light. She handed it to him. It showed a new set of schematics, even more detailed than the blueprints. Thermal overlays, real-time electrical conduit maps, the precise pressure weight of the Persian rug in front of the vault door.

“You will enter via the river,” she stated, her finger tracing a path on the screen. “The water treatment outflow pipe here, large enough for a man. It is disused and bypasses the underwater sonar net. Durand will get you to the grate and handle exterior distractions. You will have seventy-two minutes from the time you cross the property’s seismic perimeter to the time the secondary security system auto-resets. Inside, you will face only the physical safeguards and the ‘Whisper.’ You have, in your youth, opened one in under eleven minutes.”

“Blindfolded. In a quiet workshop. Not with a guard possibly doing rounds upstairs.”

“The guards’ patrol is a predictable loop. You will have a twenty-three-minute cushion of empty space. It is sufficient.” Her tone left no room for debate. It was arithmetic, not opinion.

Léo scrolled through the plans, his safecracker’s mind reluctantly engaging with the puzzle, even as his soul recoiled. It was a masterpiece of illegal architecture. Every weakness was documented, every variable accounted for. The plan was brutal, elegant, and terrifyingly plausible. It was also a gilded cage. He saw now that his role was that of a single, precise component. He didn’t need to know the greater machine. He just needed to turn.

“And after?” he asked, his voice hollow.

“You exit the way you came. You give the necklace to Durand at the extraction point. You go home. Twenty-four hours later, a safety deposit box key and the documentation for a numbered account in Geneva will be delivered to you. Enough to vanish, to give your daughter a new name, a new life far from here. The incriminating material will be destroyed in front of you, every copy.”

“And if you double-cross me? If you keep the footage?”

La Veuve looked almost disappointed. “Betrayal is a tool, Monsieur Moreau, not a habit. It erodes trust, and trust, however vile, is the currency of our world. You are of no further use to us after this. A happy, silent retiree is preferable to a vengeful, loose-ended father. We are not monsters. We are pragmatists.”

The rain fell harder, drumming a funeral march on the dumpster lids. Léo looked from the glowing plans to La Veuve’s impassive face, to the granite sentinel beside her, and back into the swallowing darkness of the alley where Durand waited. He was in a tunnel with no light at either end, only different shades of black. One black meant Elodie’s life torn to pieces. The other meant risking his own, and his soul, for a chance to stitch it back together.

He thought of the feel of the ‘Whisper’s’ dial, the almost imperceptible shudder of the tumblers aligning, a language spoken only through vibration. It was the one thing in his life he had ever been truly good at. The one thing his father had ever praised without reservation. Now that sacred skill was the lever prying him into hell.

He handed the tablet back. His hand was steady. A fatalistic calm had settled over him, the melancholy of a man reading his own verdict.

“Seventy-two minutes,” he said, the words tasting of ash and river water.

La Veuve inclined her head, a minute gesture of acknowledgment. The transaction was complete. She turned to leave, her coat sweeping the wet cobbles. Then she paused, glancing back over her shoulder. The flickering neon painted her profile in strokes of pink and shadow.

“A final piece of advice, from one professional to another,” she said, her voice barely rising above the rain. “The necklace is cursed, Monsieur Moreau. Let us hope the curse favours you.”

She and her silent companion disappeared into the gloom at the far end of the alley, swallowed as if they had never been. A moment later, Durand materialized at Léo’s side.

“Come,” Durand grunted. “We have work to do.”

As Léo followed him back out into the garish, weeping streets of Pigalle, the claustrophobia didn’t lift. It simply changed shape. It was no longer the alley’s walls, but the four-day countdown now ticking in his skull, and the immense, silent weight of a riverfront fortress waiting in the dark. He had made his bargain. He was going to steal a curse from a monster, and the only thing more terrifying than failure, he realized, might just be success. For what kind of man walks away from a deal with the devil unscathed? He touched the manila envelope over his heart, no longer just containing blueprints, but now holding the fragile, terrifying architecture of his only way out.

He had four days to become a ghost. Or to become one forever.
