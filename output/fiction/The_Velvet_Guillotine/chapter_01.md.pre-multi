Chapter 1: The Last Call

The absinthe was doing its job, making the world soft and the memories softer. Green-gold liquid swirled in Léo Moreau’s glass, a tiny, toxic galaxy. His third, or maybe his fourth. He’d lost count after the second, when the sharp edges of the bar—the chipped mahogany, the sticky rings of a thousand forgotten drinks—had blurred into a single, brown impression of failure.

Le Perroquet Gris was a tomb of aspirations. Nestled in a Montmartre side-street that smelled perpetually of wet stone and regret, its patrons were ghosts in training. Artists who’d never sold a canvas, musicians with broken reeds, and men like Léo: specialists whose specialties had rusted shut. Cheap tobacco and yesterday’s wine hung in the air, a claustrophobic blanket pressing down on the shoulders. Only a few fly-specked sconces and the dull, greenish glow of the absinthe fountain behind the bar provided light, casting everyone in the pallor of the drowned.

Léo’s hands rested on the sticky wood, a map of his career. Long, clever fingers, now marred by a slight, permanent tremor and a knuckle on his left hand a shade thicker than the others—a souvenir from a startled guard in Biarritz. Empty hands. They hadn’t felt the subtle, whispering vibration of a dial finding its true gate, or the satisfying, oiled thunk of a lever-tumbler surrendering, in over two years. Not since the De Chambord job. Not since the blood.

Closing his eyes brought no image of the vault, only the man’s face. Not as he was in life—Léo hadn’t known him—but in that fractional second of impact: the surprise, the terrible, mundane shock of interrupted existence. It hadn’t been Léo’s bullet. Pascal’s, wild and panicked. But the vault had been Léo’s to open, the timing his to command. The failure, therefore, was his. Guilt, a tenant that paid no rent, settled deeper into the hollows of his chest with each passing, purposeless day.

“Another, Monsieur Moreau?” The bartender, Gérard, asked without enthusiasm, a slab of a man with a tombstone face.

Léo nodded, pushing the empty glass forward. The last of his savings, a pathetic wad of francs grown thin and anxious, sighed in his pocket. He was drinking his way to zero, a final, logical destination. Retirement. A laugh almost escaped him. Thieves didn’t retire. They decomposed, or they got caught. He was opting for the slower, more merciful option.

The door to the street groaned open, slicing in a blade of cold, damp night air that cut through the bar’s fug. Silhouetted against the sodium glow of the streetlamp stood a figure: tall, impeccably postured. He didn’t belong. The regulars, a collection of slumped shadows, felt it too. A slight stiffening, a collective inward drawing, like worms exposed to light.

The man closed the door, sealing the warmth—and the tension—back inside. He brushed non-existent rain from the shoulders of a charcoal overcoat too fine for the arrondissement. Pale, assessing eyes scanned the room before landing on Léo with the indifference of a scientist locating a specimen. He approached. Good leather shoes made no sound on the sawdust-strewn floor.

“Léo Moreau,” the man said. It wasn’t a question. His voice was smooth, a low tenor that carried without effort. He didn’t sit, but his presence dominated the space between stools.

Léo took a slow sip of his fresh absinthe, the wormwood bitterness blooming on his tongue. “I’m retired.”

“So I hear.” A faint, humorless smile touched the man’s lips. “My name is Durand. I have a message for you.”

“I don’t want it.”

“You’ll want this one.” Durand’s smile didn’t waver. Reaching inside his coat, for a heart-clenching second, Léo’s old instincts screamed *gun*. But it was a slim, cream-colored envelope he produced. He placed it on the bar between them. Pristine, heavy stock, sealed with a blank disc of black wax. It screamed of money and menace.

Léo didn’t touch it. “Who from?”

“An interested party. Open it.”

The claustrophobia of the bar intensified, the walls leaning in, the air thickening, growing harder to pull into his lungs. Gérard and the other ghosts were watching. This was how it happened. A message. A summons. The past, reaching out a cold hand to drag you back under.

With a sigh that tasted of anise and defeat, Léo picked up the envelope. The paper was cool and stiff. A thumbnail broke the seal, the wax snapping with a final, crisp sound. Inside lay a single, folded sheet of the same expensive paper, and behind it, the glossy corner of a photograph.

He slid the photo out first.

The world dissolved, then re-formed with a vicious, crystalline clarity. All sound from the bar—the murmur of conversation, the clink of glass—vanished, replaced by a high-pitched whine in his ears.

A photograph of his daughter, Élise. She was sitting at a café table under a green awning, sunlight dappling her dark hair. Laughing, head thrown back, a picture of twenty-two-year-old joy. He hadn’t seen her laugh like that in years. Not since he’d left, not since her mother had rightly barred the door to a man who brought only trouble and police whispers. A single, school photo of her, a decade out of date, was kept in his rented room. This was current. She was beautiful.

And she was not alone.

Across from her, leaning in with an intimate smile, was a man. Late twenties, handsome in a sharp, predatory way. On the table between them, beside two coffee cups, sat a small, velvet drawstring pouch. Its mouth was open. Spilling onto the white marble tabletop, catching the sun with a malicious, unmistakable glitter, were diamonds. Raw, uncut, illegal conflict diamonds.

Breath left Léo’s body in a silent rush. His fingers, the tremor now a violent earthquake, fumbled for the note. The elegant script swam before his eyes. “Moreau, A charming scene. The gentleman is Alain Vasseur, currently wanted by three jurisdictions for trafficking. The gems are from the recent, and rather violent, Antwerp transfer. The Sûreté would find the narrative of a young woman seduced by a criminal quite compelling. Her fingerprints, as you might guess, are all over the pouch. Your unique skills are required. One last job. A simple retrieval. Midnight tonight. The old clockmaker’s shop, Rue des Moulins. Come alone, and come sober. If you refuse, or contact the authorities, these photographs and a detailed dossier on Mademoiselle Moreau’s ‘involvement’ will be delivered to Commissaire Verlain by morning. He is, as you know, notoriously unforgiving. We trust your retirement is now concluded.” There was no signature. Léo’s head swam. The absinthe, once a comfort, now churned in his gut like acid. He could see it with terrifying clarity: Élise, her laughter dying, replaced by confusion, then horror as uniformed men closed in. Her protests swallowed by procedure and the damning, photographic evidence. Verlain was a bulldog with a politician’s ambition; he’d crucify her for the headlines. She’d spend her youth in a concrete cell, her spirit broken, her future erased. And it would be his fault. His blood, his legacy of ruin, finally claiming the only good thing he’d ever had a part in creating. “She’s innocent,” Léo whispered, the words scraping his throat raw. “Of course she is,” Durand said, his tone conversational. He had produced a cigarette case, was tapping one out. “That is the point, Monsieur Moreau. Innocence is such a fragile thing. Easily… misplaced.” The rage came then, hot and blinding. Léo’s fist clenched around the photo, crumpling the image of his daughter’s joy. He lunged off the stool, a guttural sound tearing from his chest. He was not a fighter, but in that moment, he wanted to feel Durand’s fine bones break under his hands. He didn’t make it six inches. Durand moved with an economical, brutal grace. He didn’t step back. He simply caught Léo’s wrist in a vise-like grip, twisted it down and behind the small of his back, and shoved him face-first into the bar’s edge. The impact drove the air from Léo’s lungs with a painful whoosh. Durand leaned in close, his lips near Léo’s ear. He smelled of expensive cologne and cold stone. “None of that,” Durand murmured, the words sweet with threat. “You are not in a position for grand gestures. You have a choice. A simple one. Do the job, and these photographs, the negatives, all of it… disappears. Your daughter remains the bright young linguistics student she is, with no stain on her record. You can go back to drowning yourself in peace. Or,” he increased the pressure on Léo’s wrist, a sharp, warning pain, “you can be a stubborn old fool and bury her. Which is it to be?” Léo’s cheek was pressed against the cold, sticky wood. He could see his overturned absinthe glass, the green liquid spreading like poison. He saw the faces of the other patrons, averted, carefully studying their drinks. No help would come. No ever did. The fight drained out of him, leaving a cold, heavy sludge of fatalism in its place. This was the price. Not for anything he would do, but for what he had already done. The universe, or the syndicate, or just plain bad luck, had finally presented the bill. And it was payable in the only currency he had left: his skill, and what remained of his soul. “Midnight,” Léo gasped. Durand released him, stepping back smoothly. He adjusted his cuff, as if brushing off lint. “The clockmaker’s shop. Rue des Moulins. Come ready to work.” He dropped a few francs on the bar, enough to cover Léo’s tab and the broken glass. A tidy man. “And, Moreau? Sober up. The combination you’ll be listening for will be… delicate.” He turned and walked out, the door swallowing his silhouette. The bar exhaled, the normal sounds rushing back in, now horribly loud and trivial. Léo slowly righted himself. His wrist throbbed. He carefully smoothed out the crumpled photograph on the bar. Élise’s laughing face was now creased with a deep scar. He traced the line with a trembling finger. Gérard wordlessly placed a glass of water in front of him, his expression unreadable. For an hour, Léo sat perfectly still, the water untouched. He watched the patrons come and go, their lives small and contained. He envied them their simple despairs. His mind, fogged for so long, was now terrifyingly clear. It calculated, it assessed. This was a trap, of course. A ‘simple retrieval’ for people who blackmailed you with your child’s freedom was never simple. They knew about De Chambord. They knew about his hands. They knew about Élise. They knew everything. He was a tool, being taken from its moldering box for one final use, likely to be discarded, or broken, in the process. But what choice did he have? As the clock above the bar ticked towards eleven, Léo stood. His legs held. He placed a few coins from his own meager stash next to Durand’s, a pointless assertion of dignity. He folded the photograph and the note, placing them in his inner pocket, against his heart. The church bell began to toll, heavy and final in the wet air. Midnight. Léo Moreau stared into the implacable dark of the river, the photograph of Élise a pale ghost in his hand. He had failed her as a father. Now, he was her only chance.

A dead man walking. A dead man with a job to do.

His fingers, tracing the ghost-dial in his pocket, suddenly stilled. A new, visceral memory surfaced, sharp as a blade: Durand’s final, whispered words in the bar, not a threat, but a piece of information offered like a poisoned key. *“The safe in the study is a decoy, Moreau. The real one is in the nursery. Behind the mobile of stars.”*

The nursery.

The cold off the Seine pierced his coat, deeper than any chill he had ever known. This wasn’t just a theft. It was a violation engineered for him alone. They hadn’t just taken his daughter. They had studied him, known the precise contours of his soul, and built her prison from the architecture of his own most tender regrets. To get her back, he wouldn’t just open a vault.

He would have to walk into a child’s room, and dismantle his own heart.
