Chapter 5: Neon and Nerve

Chapter 5: Neon and Nerve

The rain had stopped, leaving the city steaming. From the service alley behind the mansion on Rue de l’Observance, Léo watched the guests arrive. They emerged from black cars like exotic, fragile insects, their laughter sharp and brittle against the damp night. The air smelled of wet asphalt, expensive perfume, and the faint, greasy odor of the canapés being ferried inside.

He adjusted the starched collar of his waiter’s uniform. It was a hair too tight, a constant, gentle pressure on his throat. Beside him, Felix lit a cigarette, the flare of the match illuminating the hard planes of his face. He wore the same uniform, but on him it looked like a prisoner’s garb.

“Nervous?” Felix asked, smoke curling from his nostrils.

“I’m always nervous,” Léo replied, his voice low. “It’s the only thing that keeps me alive.”

The rest of the crew were already inside. Anya, her blonde hair pinned into a severe bun, was circulating with a tray of champagne flutes, her eyes missing nothing. Marcel, posing as a sommelier, was in the wine cellar, memorizing the patrol patterns of the two private security teams Saint-Clair had layered over the house staff. They were professionals, moving with a bored, predatory grace. The real staff, harried and underpaid, were the perfect camouflage.

Léo’s earpiece, a flesh-colored nub, crackled. Anya’s voice, a whisper woven into the distant throb of a techno-opera hybrid. “Main hall is a zoo. Synthetic euphorics in the air vents. People are already taking off their clothes in the east gallery. Security is distracted, leering.”

“Understood,” Léo murmured. He looked at Felix. “Let’s go.”

They slipped in through the servant’s door, immediately swallowed by the roaring, humid bowels of the mansion. The kitchen was a battlefield of stainless steel and shouted French. A sous-chef shoved a tray of blini topped with caviar and gold leaf into Léo’s hands. “Circulate! Allez!”

For fifteen agonizing minutes, they played their part. Léo moved through the swirling chaos of the party, a ghost in plain sight. The grand hall was a cathedral of decadence. A thousand crystal pendants in the chandelier refracted the pulsing neon lights, casting fractured, lurid colors over the crowd. The air was thick with the scent of sweat, oud, and the sweet, chemical tang of the drugs filtering through the ventilation. A woman in a dress made of what appeared to be shattered mirrors wept with laughter while a man in a silk robe fed her a strawberry. In a corner, two men fenced with icicles snapped from a glacial sculpture, their tips dripping onto the Persian rug.

It was a perfect, beautiful nightmare. And it was their cover.

Marcel’s voice came through the earpiece, calm and measured. “Alpha security team just changed shift. Beta team is hanging around near the kitchen, complaining about the caterers. You’ve got a window. Sub-basement access is clear from the Butler’s pantry. Go now.”

Léo caught Felix’s eye and gave a slight nod.
