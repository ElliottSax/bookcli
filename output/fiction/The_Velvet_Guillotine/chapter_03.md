Chapter 3: Casing the Ivory Tower

Rain over the Île Saint-Louis was not the romantic mist of postcards, but a fine, persistent grit—a wet ash that seeped through the wool of Léo’s coat and into the marrow of his bones. For three days, he had haunted the quays opposite the Hôtel Saint-Clair, a man-shaped patch of damp shadow. Like a ship moored in the Seine, the island floated adrift from the concerns of Paris, and at its stern, the mansion rose as a cliff of pale limestone, its windows blind eyes reflecting only the grey river sky.

From a recessed doorway on the Quai de la Tournelle, the smell of old urine and wet stone kept constant company. His tools were simple: a small pair of brass-rimmed binoculars, a notebook already swollen with damp, and a patience dredged from a deep, weary well. The fortress told a story of quiet, impregnable power.

Routines ran with clockwork precision. At 7:15 AM, the heavy, iron-studded service door on the rue des Deux-Ponts groaned open to admit a baker’s boy, his basket checked by a guard whose breath plumed in the cold air. By 8:00, a different guard—always a different one—walked the perimeter with the measured, predatory pace of a wolf on a known circuit, eyes never still. At 10:00, the curtains on the second-floor grand salon drew back by an unseen hand. Through the binoculars, only a sliver of gilded ceiling appeared, along with a monstrous crystal chandelier like a frozen explosion.

But the river side presented the true masterpiece of paranoia. The mansion’s back plunged directly into the Seine, its foundations lapped by oily water. A private mooring housed a sleek, black motor launch, its canvas cover taut. Subtler details gave it away: the glint of sensor-lights along the waterline, visible only when the light struck just so; the complete absence of river rats or pigeons on the stretch of stonework descending into the water. At dusk, a piece of driftwood floated too close. A silent guard appeared on the lower balcony, tracking it with what could only be a rifle until the current carried it away. This wasn’t just security. It was a territory, marked and defended.

On the fourth morning, his body a symphony of aches, Léo needed eyes inside. Not the physical interior—that was a dream for later—but the paper interior, the world that allowed one to move through such spaces. He needed Simone.

He found her in the 13th arrondissement, within a labyrinthine apartment block smelling of boiled cabbage and linseed oil. Her workshop was a cave of paper dust and fading glory. Filing cabinets stood like tombstones, a massive, obsolete lithography press occupied one corner, and everywhere, in precise piles, lay the artifacts of identity: passports, birth certificates, letterhead, stamps. The air tasted of ink and forgery.

Simone, in her sixties, was built of angles and cigarette smoke, her hair a fierce grey helmet. Peering over half-moon spectacles, her hands—stained with permanent blue—did not pause as she expertly aged a Belgian passport with a tea wash and careful abrasion.

“Léo Moreau. I heard you’d finally sunk. The word was you’d opened a locksmith’s shop in Clichy. An honest trade.” Her voice shifted like gravel.

“The shop sank first.” Léo’s own voice rasped from days of silence. He accepted no coffee. The clutter pressed in, a physical weight. “I need to be someone else, Simone. Someone with a reason to be near the Île Saint-Louis. A municipal inspector. Water board.”

Setting down her brush, she lit a Gauloise and inhaled as if it were the only oxygen in the room. “The Île Saint-Louis? Don’t be cheap. The rich have their own water. They have their own everything. Who is it?”

“It doesn’t matter.”

“It always matters. The paper has to fit the man. You look like a man waiting for a prison sentence, not a gas inspector.” Her eyes, sharp as pinpricks, scanned him. “This is a bad one. I can smell it on you. The desperation is different. It’s cold.”

Léo said nothing. He placed a roll of francs on the table, next to a pot of dried glue—most of what the blackmailer had advanced him.

Simone looked at the money, then back at him. She didn’t touch it. “There’s a legend, you know. Among certain collectors. A piece that travels in shadow. A necklace. They say it’s cursed. Not with ghosts or whispers, but with a pure, logical ruin. It brings a collapse—financial, social, mortal—to anyone who claims to own it. A banker in Vienna drowned in his bath. A Hollywood starlet’s face melted in a fire. A sheikh’s kingdom turned to sand. They say it’s because the thing was never meant to be possessed. It’s a verb, not a noun. An act of theft made solid.”

A chill, unrelated to the damp, crawled up Léo’s spine. “Superstition. The rich love a story that makes their trinkets seem important.”

“Do they?” A smoke ring hung in the still air. “The man on the island, in the white stone house. He has it. Has had it for five years. And his empire doesn’t collapse. It grows. He doesn’t hide it in a vault; he wears it, they say, at private dinners. As if daring the curse. What does that tell you, Léo?”

“That he’s immune to fairy tales.”

“Or,” Simone leaned forward, her voice dropping, “that he is the curse. That the ruin isn’t an external force. It’s him. He is the agent of the collapse. For others. Perhaps for anyone who tries to take it from him.”

The claustrophobia of the room intensified. Stacks of paper seemed to lean in, listening. Léo thought of the blackmailer’s calm threat, the photographic evidence of his own private ruin. He was already collapsing. What was one more curse?

“Just the papers, Simone. A credentials wallet for the Archives Nationales. Something to justify loitering, asking questions of the locals.”
She stared at him for a long moment, then stubbed out her cigarette with finality. She took the money. “Three days. You’ll be a historical researcher, surveying pre-Revolutionary riverfront property lines. Dull enough that no one will ask follow-up questions,” official enough to flash a badge. But Léo…” She paused, her hand on a blank identity card. “Some houses are not just guarded. They are hungry. This one feels hungry.”

He left her to her alchemy, the smell of smoke and failure clinging to him. He returned to his vigil, now with the nascent identity of one “Alain Mercier” folded in his inner pocket. It felt like a shroud.

The next evening, as the twilight bleached the sky a sickly violet, the hook was set.

A black Citroën Traction Avant, sleek and official, slid over the bridge onto the island and stopped at the service entrance of the Saint-Clair mansion. No fanfare. The door opened before the car had fully settled. A man got out. He was tall, broad in the way of a former athlete now running to fat, encased in a beautifully tailored overcoat. He turned briefly to speak to the driver, and the light from the doorway fell on his face.

Léo’s breath caught in his throat, a sharp, physical pain.

Commander Serge Vallot. Head of the Police Judiciaire for the 1st arrondissement. A man whose picture was often in the papers, shaking hands with politicians, receiving medals for service. A man who, a decade ago, had taken a thick envelope from a young, terrified safecracker named Léo Moreau, in the back room of a bar near the Gare du Nord. The envelope had contained every franc Léo had from his first big score, and in return, Vallot had made a burglary charge disappear. It was the first time Léo had understood that the law was not a wall, but a marketplace. Vallot had been the grinning salesman.

And here he was, ducking his head deferentially as he was admitted into Saint-Clair’s fortress. Not with the swagger of an official on a call, but with the haste of a subordinate reporting to his master.

The world seemed to tilt. The mansion was no longer just a physical stronghold. It was a nexus. It had threads that reached into the very fabric of the city’s power, threads that could strangle a man like Léo without a sound. The blackmailer’s job was impossible. Vallot’s presence made it suicidal. A high-ranking police commander was visiting. He wasn’t providing security; he was client, or accomplice.

Léo’s hands were trembling. He shoved them deep into his pockets, pressing his nails into his palms until the pain grounded him. He needed to see the eye of the hurricane. He needed to see Saint-Clair.

His opportunity came two days later. A crisp, cold morning with a brittle sun. The market on the rue Jean du Bellay was bustling, the air thick with the smell of cheese and flowers. Léo, as Alain Mercier, was making pointless sketches of sewer gratings, his back to the river. A change in the rhythm of the guards’ patrols—a subtle convergence near the main gate—made him turn.

The grand front doors of the Hôtel Saint-Clair opened.

Not the service door, but the monumental, carved double doors that led to the main courtyard. Two guards emerged first, taking positions. Then, he appeared.

Édouard Saint-Clair was a man of perhaps fifty, but he carried his years like a well-fitted suit. He was tall, lean, dressed in a charcoal grey overcoat that seemed to absorb the weak light. His hair was steel-grey, swept back from a high, intelligent forehead. He paused on the threshold, pulling on leather gloves, and surveyed his domain.

It was the calm that struck Léo, a cold fist around his heart. This was not the flamboyant arrogance of the nouveau riche, nor the brittle hauteur of old aristocracy. This was the terrifying, absolute calm of deep water. Saint-Clair’s eyes, even from this distance, seemed to miss nothing—the pattern of the pigeons on the cobbles, the angle of the guard’s shoulder, the unknown man pretending to sketch a sewer grate across the street. His gaze passed over Léo without a flicker, but Léo felt it like a physical touch, a clinical assessment and immediate dismissal. This was a man who calculated the world as a system of pressures and levers, of threats and assets. Human beings were merely components.

Saint-Clair descended the steps to a waiting, silent electric car—a luxurious, anachronistic voiturette for moving through the island. He did not speak. He did not need to. A slight nod, and the vehicle whispered into motion, turning towards the Pont Saint-Louis. As it passed, Léo saw the profile: the sharp, patrician nose, the unsmiling mouth, the utter absence of doubt.

A deep, visceral dread settled in Léo’s gut, heavy as a stone. This was not a target. This was a force of nature. Simone’s words echoed in his mind: He is the curse.

The job was a death sentence. The blackmailer had not forced him into a crime, but into a vortex. To steal from Saint-Clair was to reach into the mechanism of a perfect, silent clock and try to snatch a cog. You wouldn’t just fail; you would be obliterated by the ongoing, indifferent motion of the thing.

Léo packed his sketchbook with numb fingers. The brief sun was gone, swallowed by rolling, leaden clouds. The claustrophobia was total now. The island was a trap. Paris itself felt like the jaws of it. He had to move, to think, to find some use in a world that had just proven itself utterly flat, utterly owned.

He fled the Île Saint-Louis, feeling the blind, pale eyes of the mansion on his back all the way across the bridge. He went not to his own dingy room, but to the one place he knew he could be invisible—the catacombs. The official entrance was closed, but he knew an old smuggler’s drop near Denfert-Rochereau, a rusted grate he could force.

The descent into the cool, absolute dark was a perverse relief. The smell of wet earth and ancient stone was cleaner than the river air. He used a small electric torch, its beam a frail cone in the immense blackness. He walked for twenty minutes, through tunnels lined with neat, macabre stacks of femurs and skulls, a city of the dead beneath the city of the living. Here, the pressure lifted. Here, Saint-Clair’s authority did not reach.

He found his usual spot, a small ossuary nook where he’d sometimes hidden loot in the past. He sat on the cold ground, back against a wall of silent, watching skulls, and tried to still the panic in his chest. He turned off his torch. The darkness was complete, a velvet smothering. He focused on the distant, eternal drip of water.

And then he heard it.

Not water. A breath. A soft, shuffling scrape of a shoe on stone, maybe thirty feet away, back the way he had come.

He froze, his own breath held. No one came down here alone, not this deep, not at this hour. The cataphiles, the urban explorers, traveled in groups, laughing and shining bright lights. This was stealthy.

The sound did not come again. Had he imagined it? The silence of the catacombs was a living thing, full of tricks.

Then, a whisper, so faint it might have been the air moving through a skull’s eye socket: “Moreau.”

It wasn’t a question. It was a statement. A identification.

Léo’s blood turned to ice. He didn’t move. He didn’t breathe. The voice was unfamiliar, genderless, muffled by the labyrinth.

“You look for a way into a house of stone,” the whisper came again, closer now. Maybe twenty feet. “There is only one way. Through the river of the dead.”

A click. Not a gun. The strike of a match. For a single, horrifying second, a face was illuminated in the sudden flare—pale, gaunt, features hollowed by the upward light, eyes like black pits. It was there, and then it was gone, plunged back into blackness as the match died.

But in that instant, Léo saw what the figure held in its other hand. Not a weapon.

A small, familiar, velvet-lined case. The kind that holds a single piece of exquisite jewelry.

The case was open.

And it was empty.
