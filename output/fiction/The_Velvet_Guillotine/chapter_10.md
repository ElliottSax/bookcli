Chapter 10: Betrayal at 210 Meters

Chapter 10: Betrayal at 210 Meters

The wind at two hundred and ten meters was a different animal. It didn’t howl; it hissed, a thin, spiteful sound that slithered between the skeletal steel beams of the unfinished Tour Cygne. It carried the damp, metallic breath of the Seine far below and the distant, indifferent glow of a city that had long since stopped looking up. The floor was a grid of darkness and pale concrete, dotted with pools of rainwater that reflected a sliver of moon like spilled mercury. Léo stood in one such pool, the cold seeping through the soles of his shoes, feeling the void yawn beneath the perforated decking.

Across from him, twenty paces away, Claire held his daughter. Sophie was bundled in a too-large coat, her face pale and smudged with tears and dirt, but her eyes were wide, locked on his. She wasn’t crying now. She was in the quiet, terrified stillness that comes after all the screams are used up. Claire’s arm was around her, not tenderly, but with the firm, pragmatic grip of a piece of human cargo. Her own face was a mask of grim endurance, the scar on her jaw taut.

To Léo’s left, framed by the raw opening where a panoramic window would one day be, stood Armand Saint-Clair. He wore a cashmere overcoat, the grey almost silver in the gloom, and looked as out of place as a diamond in a coal seam. Two of his men flanked him—hulking, silent shapes with the specific density of professional violence. To Léo’s right, emerging from the shadow of the construction elevator housing, was the man from the state: Inspector Roux. He was alone, which was more unnerving than a squadron. He was a lean man in a nondescript trench coat, his face all planes and angles, like something carved from old wood. His eyes held no light.

“The merchandise, Léo,” Saint-Clair said, his voice calm, almost conversational, as if discussing a wine list. The wind stole his words and tossed them into the abyss.

Léo’s hand went to the satchel slung across his chest. The weight of the ledger inside was negligible. The weight of what it represented was crushing. He had spent seventy-two sleepless hours in a stinking safehouse, under Claire’s watchful, resentful eye, crafting the forgery. He’d used the right paper, stolen from a municipal archive. Mimicked the ink bleeds, the bureaucratic stamps, the idiosyncratic shorthand of the late, compromised accountant. It was a work of art, a ghost of corruption past. It had to be.

“The girl first,” Léo said. His voice was rough, shredded by fear and coffee.

Saint-Clair smiled, a thin curve of condescension. “You are not in a position to negotiate. The book. Then you can take your… family.” He flicked a glance at Claire, the insult implicit.

Léo’s gaze darted to Roux. The Inspector gave a minute, almost imperceptible nod. It was the signal. The state would handle Saint-Clair. The ledger was the priority. Justice, or its facsimile, would be served.

With a final look at Sophie—I’m sorry, I’m so sorry—Léo unclasped the satchel. He walked forward, the wind plucking at his jacket, until he was halfway. He placed the satchel on the cold concrete. He backed away, ten steps, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs.

Saint-Clair nodded to one of his thugs. The man lumbered forward, retrieved the bag, and brought it to his boss. Saint-Clair opened it, withdrew the ledger. He produced a small, elegant penlight. He began to flip pages. The silence stretched, punctuated only by the eternal hiss of the wind. Léo watched his face, searching for a flicker of triumph, of satisfaction.

Instead, he saw a frown. Then a smirk. Saint-Clair looked up, not at Léo, but at Inspector Roux.

“Inspector. You disappoint me. You think I would not have my own experts examine the original? Before my unfortunate accountant… departed?” He held up a page, the paper fluttering. “The watermark is correct. The signatures are passable. But the entry for the Cypriot transfer… the date format is American. Month, then day. A forgery. A good one. But a forgery.”

The world tilted. Léo’s stomach turned to ice. He had copied the dates exactly as they were. He was sure of it. Unless… unless the original he’d been given by La Veuve had already been altered. A test within a trap.

Roux’s expression did not change. He simply sighed, a sound of profound weariness. “It doesn’t matter, Saint-Clair.”

“It matters a great deal,” the magnate said, his voice hardening. “It means he does not have the real one. Or he is keeping it. Which means your little arrangement is void.” He snapped his fingers. His second thug raised a pistol, not at Léo, but at Sophie and Claire.

“Wait,” Roux said, the word cutting through the wind. He took a single step forward. “The authenticity of the ledger is irrelevant. My purpose here was never to prosecute you.”

Saint-Clair paused, the penlight freezing on Roux’s face. “No?”

“No. The Republic cannot withstand the scandal of the real ledger’s contents. The ministers, the prefects, the judges… your ‘associates’. The system would fracture. My orders are not to retrieve it. They are to ensure it ceases to exist.” Roux’s hand moved slowly to inside his trench coat. “You have a forgery. Burn it, for all I care. The man who made it will tell me where the real one is. Or he will die. And you, Saint-Clair, will walk away from this tower tonight. The state prefers its monsters in the shadows, where it knows where to feed them.”

The revelation landed like a physical blow. Léo felt the air leave his lungs. He had been a fool. He’d believed in a binary: criminal versus law. But this was the true Paris, the city beneath the velvet: a continuum of rot, where the only difference was the uniform worn by the corrupt. La Veuve had wanted to burn it all down. Roux just wanted to turn out the lights so no one could see the cracks.

Saint-Clair laughed, a dry, rustling sound. “How pragmatic. And how utterly French.” He closed the fake ledger. “But you see, Inspector, I cannot have loose ends. The forger knows my business. And the woman… she has caused me considerable expense.” He nodded to his gunman. “Kill them all. Except the child. She may have uses.”

The standoff crystallized, sharp and lethal. Roux’s hand emerged from his coat holding a sleek service pistol. Saint-Clair’s thug swung his weapon from Claire to Roux. The second thug drew his own gun, aiming at Léo. Léo was unarmed, standing in his pool of moonlight, a spectator to his own execution.

A shot rang out.

But it was not from the tower.


The van's headlights cast an eerie glow on the rain-soaked streets as they careened through the deserted boulevards. Léo's knuckles were white around the steering wheel, his eyes darting between the rearview mirror and the road ahead. Claire sat beside him, her gaze fixed on the backseat, where Sophie's small form was huddled, her eyes fixed on the floor.

Armand Saint-Clair's voice cut through the silence, his words dripping with condescension. "You're not even sure where you're going, Léo. You're just winging it, hoping to stumble upon something."

Léo's jaw clenched, the muscles in his face twitching with anger. "I know exactly where I'm going," he said, his voice low and even. "And I know exactly what I'm looking for."


The van's interior was a steel box, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and motor oil. Léo's eyes adjusted slowly, the dim light from the dashboard casting eerie shadows on the walls. Claire's profile was a sharp line, her jaw clenched as she navigated the narrow streets. Sophie's small body was a fragile weight in his arms, her eyes fixed on his face with a mixture of fear and trust.

As they turned a corner, the van's tires screeched, and Léo's grip on Sophie tightened. The streetlights blurred together, a kaleidoscope of color and light that seemed to spin around them. Claire's hands were white-knuckled on the wheel, her face a mask of concentration.

The van slowed, and Léo felt a jolt as they hit a pothole. Sophie's eyes flickered closed, and she let out a small whimper. Léo's heart ached, and he pulled her closer, trying to comfort her without making things worse. "Shh, ma chérie," he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the engine.

Claire's voice cut through the tension, her words low and even. "We're here." The van's headlights illuminated a nondescript building, its facade a blank slate of concrete and steel. Léo's eyes narrowed, his mind racing with possibilities. What lay ahead?

The van swerved, narrowly avoiding a puddle that reflected the faint glow of the dashboard lights. The sound of rain pattering on the roof was the only sound, a relentless drumbeat that seemed to match the pounding of Léo's heart.

Claire's hand brushed against his, a fleeting touch that sent a spark of electricity through his body. He didn't look at her, didn't acknowledge the gesture. Instead, he focused on the road ahead, his eyes fixed on the dark, rain-slicked pavement.

The city seemed to stretch on forever, a labyrinth of shadows and secrets. Léo's grip on the wheel tightened, his knuckles white with tension. He was driving into the unknown, with no map, no compass, and no clear destination. All he had was his determination, and the burning need to uncover the truth.

It came from across the canyon of space, from the rooftop of the adjacent, lower office building. The report was a flat, distant crack, swallowed instantly by the wind. Saint-Clair’s gunman, the one aiming at Roux, jerked as if punched in the chest. A dark flower bloomed on his sternum. He took a stumbling step backward, over the edge of the open floor. He did not scream. He simply vanished into the humming darkness.

Chaos, silent and frantic, erupted.

Saint-Clair dove behind a stack of rebar. His remaining enforcer opened fire in the general direction of the sniper, the muzzle flashes strobing the darkness. Roux, cool and precise, dropped to a knee and fired twice. The thug spun and fell.

Léo was already moving, a raw scream tearing from his throat. “SOPHIE!”

Claire had shoved the girl to the wet concrete and thrown herself over her. Léo scrambled towards them, his vision tunnelled. He saw Roux shift his aim, not at Saint-Clair, but at him. The state had its new priority: the forger who knew where the real poison was buried.

From his cover, Saint-Clair saw it too. He saw Roux’s focus shift to Léo. He saw his chance. The fake ledger was still in his hand. It was something. A token. A story he could control. He rose and sprinted, a grey ghost, towards the interior stairwell.

Roux’s shot missed Léo by inches, chipping concrete near his head. The sniper fired again. This time the bullet sparked off the steel beam just above Roux, forcing him to flinch and seek cover.

Léo reached Claire and Sophie. He hauled his daughter up. She was a dead weight, shocked into muteness. “The elevator!” Claire yelled, pointing to the construction cage at the far side of the floor. It was their only way down.

They ran, hunched over, feet slipping on wet metal. The wind now felt like a wall. Léo clutched Sophie to his chest. Claire led, her pistol—where had she gotten it?—swinging behind them, providing what cover she could.

Another shot from the sniper. This one struck flesh.

Henri Rocher, who had been lurking in the deep shadows near the elevator housing as Léo’s desperate, last-chance backup, let out a wet, surprised grunt. He stumbled out into the open, clutching his throat where a red torrent pulsed between his fingers. He looked at Léo, his eyes wide with a profound sense of betrayal—not by Léo, but by the city itself, by the fatalistic calculus that had just deemed him expendable. He collapsed to his knees, then onto his side, his blood mixing with the rainwater, a dark, spreading stain on the pale concrete.

“NO!” Léo cried out, but Claire was already yanking him forward. She slammed the rusted gate of the construction elevator shut and hit the descent button.

The cage jerked, then began a groaning, shuddering descent along the outside of the tower. The world outside the mesh walls blurred into streaks of light and darkness. Sophie buried her face in Léo’s neck, her small body shaking violently. Claire kept her gun trained upward, her breath coming in sharp gasps.

Above, on the 70th floor, the shooting had stopped. Roux stood at the edge, looking down at the descending elevator. He made no move to fire. He simply watched, his face a monument to grim resolve. He raised a hand to his ear, speaking into a comms unit. The message was clear: the hunt was now official. Léo Verdant was a target of the French state.

The elevator passed the 50th floor, the 40th. The normal sounds of the city began to filter up: the faint wail of sirens now converging on the Tour Cygne, the rumble of a late-night metro train.

“La Veuve’s sniper,” Claire panted, finally lowering her gun. “Durand. He saved your life. And mine.”

“He killed Rocher,” Léo said, the words hollow. The old cop’s dying eyes haunted the darkness behind his own.

“He was aiming for Roux. The wind… it’s a fickle bitch at this height.” She leaned back against the cage, exhaustion etching deep lines into her face. “She kept her word. She provided distraction. She didn’t promise a clean exit.”

The elevator hit the ground level with a bone-jarring thud. They spilled out into the basement parking garage, a cavern of raw concrete and shadows. A small, unmarked van was waiting, engine running. La Veuve’s network.

As they bundled Sophie into the back, Léo looked up one last time. The top of the Tour Cygne was a dark spike against the bruised purple sky. Up there, in the whispering wind, lay a fake ledger, a dead policeman, and the shattered illusion of order. Saint-Clair was in the wind, armed with a fiction he could weaponize. Roux was in the wind, a hunter with the limitless resources of a terrified state.

And he, Léo Verdant, forger, father, fool, was in the wind too. But he had the only thing that mattered, trembling and silent in his arms. And he had the real ledger’s location—a secret now more dangerous than any bomb—burned into his memory.

Claire slid the van door shut, plunging them into near darkness. “Where now?” she asked, her voice flat.

Léo looked at his daughter’s tear-streaked face, then at the scarred woman who was now his only ally in a world of enemies. The van pulled out, leaving the tower of betrayal behind.

“Deeper,” he whispered, as the city swallowed them whole.
