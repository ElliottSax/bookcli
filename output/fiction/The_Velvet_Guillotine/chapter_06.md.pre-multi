Chapter 6: The Scarlet Truth

Chapter 6: The Scarlet Truth

The air in the vault, once cool and sterile, turned to soup. It was the smell of cordite, copper, and the sour tang of ruptured organs. Léo’s world had narrowed to a tunnel of screaming noise and strobing muzzle flashes.

It had been silent, a perfect, held-breath silence as Anya’s picks found the final tumblers of the secondary gate. The main vault door, a masterpiece of deception, stood open. Inside, under a single, cold LED bar, sat the objectives: on a velvet pedestal, the Scarlet Tears glimmered with a malevolent, liquid light. And beside it, unassuming and grim, a brushed steel lockbox the size of a large ledger.

Then the world exploded.

The door they’d so delicately bypassed didn’t burst inward; the entire rear wall of the vault chamber shuddered and slid open with a hydraulic sigh. Saint-Clair’s head of security, Rocher, filled the space. He wasn’t a man; he was a geography of violence—shoulders like cliff faces, a neck that swallowed his chin, eyes that reflected the LED light like a shark’s. He held a compact submachine gun with casual familiarity. Four others flanked him, armed and armoured.

“Evening, gentlemen,” Rocher said, his voice a gravelly rumble. “You can leave the Tears. We’ll take the box, too. Saves on cleaning.”

Felix, ever the artist, moved first. Not to fight, but to photograph. His camera, slung low, gave a soft click-whirr. It was an instinct, a final composition. Rocher’s head tilted a fraction. The bullet took Felix in the throat. There was no dramatic spray, just a wet, punctured sound. Felix dropped to his knees, a look of profound surprise on his face, his hands fluttering to his neck as if adjusting a tie. Then he toppled sideways, the camera cracking against the polished concrete.

The firefight was not a duel; it was a slaughterhouse ballet. Anya was already moving, a spectre in black, her small pistol barking twice. One of Rocher’s men grunted, clutching his thigh. She dove behind a server rack as return fire chewed the air where she’d been.

Léo’s own weapon, a sleek 9mm, felt like a child’s toy. He fired, the recoil jarring his wrist, the sound monstrous in the enclosed space. The noise was physical, a pressure against the eardrums, a weight on the chest. He saw Marcel, the old safecracker, try to make for the door, his face a mask of geriatric terror. A short burst from a rifle stitched a line of crimson roses across his chest. He fell without a sound.

Alain. The thought was a spike of ice. Alain was outside, in the van, the getaway man. He’d be hearing this cacophony through the open comms. Léo could imagine him, fingers white on the steering wheel, eyes wide, the panic rising like bile.

“Léo! The prize!” Anya screamed, her voice slicing through the din. She provided covering fire, her shots precise, forcing Rocher to take a step back.

Léo lunged. Not with grace, but with the desperate, scrabbling energy of a rat in a flooding cage. He swept the Scarlet Tears from their pedestal. The diamonds were cold, surprisingly heavy. He shoved the entire nest of them into his reinforced satchel. His eyes fell on the metal ledger box. It was what Rocher had mentioned first. We’ll take the box, too. In a split second, a thief’s calculus: if the monster wants it, it has value. His free hand closed on the handle. It was far heavier than it looked, solid. He wrenched it up.

“No!” Rocher bellowed, the first note of emotion—rage—colouring his voice. The focus of fire shifted towards Léo.

Anya saw it. “Go! The outflow!” She jerked her head towards a grille in the floor at the vault’s rear, their whispered, desperate contingency plan. She threw a small smoke canister. Grey plumes erupted, filling the chamber with a choking, acrid fog.

Léo didn’t hesitate. He owed her his life a dozen times over; one more debt meant nothing. He dropped to the floor, his fingers finding the cold grate. Anya had pre-cut it. A hard kick and it gave way, revealing a yawning, black hole and the distant, echoing sound of rushing water. The sewage outflow for the mansion’s lower levels, leading to the Seine.

He glanced back once. Through the smoke, he saw Anya, a silhouette of fury, exchanging fire with Rocher’s advancing shape. He saw Felix’s still form, one hand outstretched towards his shattered camera. He saw Marcel’s vacant eyes. Then he dropped into the darkness.

The fall was short, into a shallow stream of foul, warm water. The impact drove the air from his lungs. The satchel and the metal box were anchors, threatening to drag him under. He scrambled to his feet, slipping on the slimy concrete channel. Behind and above, he heard Rocher’s roar of fury, then the deafening percussion of gunfire directed down the chute. Bullets sparked and whined off the concrete, one buzzing past his ear like an angry hornet.

He ran, hunched over, the world reduced to the feel of slick stone under his palms, the reek of decay, and the thunder of his own heart. The channel sloped downward. The sound of the Seine grew from a murmur to a roar. A circle of lesser darkness appeared ahead—the outflow pipe, barred with a rusted grate. He hit it with his shoulder, the pain blinding. It held. More gunfire echoed down the tunnel. He could hear splashing pursuit.

Frantically, he felt the edges. The grate was ancient, the river’s corrosion its own locksmith. He braced his back against one wall, his feet against the grate, and pushed with every ounce of failing strength. Muscles screamed in his back and legs. The metal groaned, rust flaking away, then with a shriek of protest, the entire grate tore free and vanished into the black water beyond.

Léo tumbled out after it.

The shock of the Seine in November was a mortal blow. The cold was an electric fist that clenched around his chest, stopping his breath. The current grabbed him greedily. He fought to the surface, gasping, the weight of the satchel and the box pulling him under. He could see the illuminated bulk of Saint-Clair’s mansion high on the bank, windows glowing like indifferent eyes. Muzzle flashes lit the mouth of the outflow pipe. Bullets slapped the water around him, thwip-thwip-thwip, seeking him in the dark.

He didn’t swim; he surrendered to the current, letting it carry him away from the gunfire, kicking only to keep his head above the oily surface. The lights of the mansion receded, replaced by the darker hulks of industrial barges and the skeletal outlines of riverside warehouses. After an eternity, his numb feet brushed against submerged rubble. He clawed his way onto a narrow, garbage-strewn bank, behind a crumbling concrete piling that smelled of urine and dead fish.

He lay there, vomiting river water, his body wracked with violent shivers. The sounds of the city were distant, muffled. Here, there was only the lap of filthy water, the distant moan of a barge horn, and the ragged saw of his own breathing. He was alone. Felix was dead. Marcel was dead. Anya… he didn’t know. Alain had fled; he knew it in his gut. The crew was gone.

For a long time, he just existed, a piece of refuse washed ashore. The cold seeped into his bones, a deep, permanent chill. Finally, the professional instinct, the thief’s post-operation ritual, asserted itself. Inventory.

With trembling, salt-raw fingers, he unzipped the satchel. The Scarlet Tears were there, a tangled heap of fire and ice even in the dim ambient light. They were worth a kingdom. They were also utterly, irrevocably cursed. He could never fence them. They were a death sentence in gem form.

His hand then went to the metal box, lying beside him in the mud. It was sealed with a simple but robust combination lock, now dripping with river water. He found a chunk of broken brick and, with three blunt, brutal blows, smashed the mechanism. The lid sprang open.

There were no jewels. No bearer bonds. No secret maps.

It was a ledger. A simple, leather-bound ledger, the pages thick and high-quality. It was slightly damp at the edges.

Léo fumbled for a small, waterproof penlight from a pouch on his belt. The tiny beam was a fragile sun in the oppressive dark. He opened the book.

The pages were filled with neat, meticulous entries in black ink. Columns. Dates. Initials. Sums. Not astronomical sums, but significant, regular, businesslike.

05/11 - P. D. - A. - 75,000 - Ref: Tender 44B
12/11 - M. G. - C. - 120,000 - Ref: Zoning Variance 7
19/11 - J. K. - A. - 50,000 - Monthly Retainer

He turned the page. More entries. Different initials. Different references that sounded like government contracts, parliamentary bills, judicial case numbers. He recognized a few. “P.D.” could be Philippe Durand, the Minister of the Interior. “M.G.” was likely Michel Gervais, a media magnate. “C.” as the recipient column appeared again and again.

Saint-Clair’s initial.

Léo’s shivering stopped, replaced by a cold far deeper than the river’s chill. This wasn’t a list of Saint-Clair’s expenses. It was a registry of incomes. Payments received. For services rendered.

He flipped further. The references grew darker. Arms Embargo Override. Prisoner Transfer Cancellation. Witness Disappearance (Marseille). The sums increased. The initials belonged to judges, generals, senior police officials, CEOs of state-controlled industries.

The final pages were different. They contained not payments, but outcomes. Verdict: Not Guilty. Contract Awarded: Delta Corp. Promotion Approved: Colonel V. Article Killed: Le Monde.

Léo closed the book. The penlight beam shook in his hand. The velvety blackness of the riverbank seemed to press in on him, heavy with understanding. He had gone to steal a glittering trinket. He had instead ripped out the country’s still-beating, rotten heart.

The Scarlet Tears were a lure, a decadent symbol. This ledger was the reality. This was the true treasure, the true poison. Saint-Clair wasn’t just a wealthy pervert; he was the central switchboard in a vast, national machine of corruption. He brokered influence, buried scandals, orchestrated justice and injustice for a price. This book was a map of every compromised hand in France. It was power absolute.

And Rocher hadn’t been trying to protect the diamonds. He’d been sent to secure the ledger. Léo, in his panicked greed, had taken the one thing Saint-Clair could not afford to lose.

He leaned back against the cold concrete, a hollow laugh escaping his chapped lips. He had the means to burn the entire edifice down. He also had a target painted on his back that would make every powerful man in the nation into his hunter. The police, the judiciary, the press—they wouldn’t be seeking a thief. They’d be erasing a mistake.

He thought of Alain, probably hyperventilating in a cheap hotel room. He thought of Anya, dead or captured. He thought of Felix, dying for a perfect shot. They had all been pawns in a game they never understood, their heist a chaotic spark next to a powder keg.

The diamonds in his bag were worthless. The book in his hands was a death warrant. And somewhere in the city, a man named Rocher would be mobilizing not just private security, but every dark lever this ledger controlled to hunt him.

Léo tucked the ledger inside his shirt, against his skin. It felt like a slab of ice, or a tumour. He stood on unsteady legs, the weight of it bending his spine. He was no longer just a thief on the run. He was a secret that had escaped its cage. And secrets this scarlet never stayed hidden for long.

He looked up at the indifferent city skyline, a constellation of false stars. Somewhere out there, a guillotine was being built for him, its blade velvet-wrapped and silent. He had to move. But first, he had to decide: was this ledger a shield, or the one thing in the world worth dying to expose?

The river offered no answer. It just flowed on, carrying the city’s filth out to sea.
