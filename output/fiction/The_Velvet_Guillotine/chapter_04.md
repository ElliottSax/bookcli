Chapter 4: Ghosts and Gear

Chapter 4: Ghosts and Gear

The safehouse was a cavity in the city’s gut. A disused printshop in the 13th arrondissement, its air was still thick with the ghost of ink and damp paper. Léo stood in the center of the main room, the high windows painted black, and felt the silence press in like a physical weight. It was the silence of a tomb, and he was the fool arranging the flowers.

He’d chosen it for the concrete floor, the single heavy door, and the fact that the rent was paid in cash from a dead man’s pocket. La Veuve’s advance, a thick envelope of non-sequential euros, was already bleeding away, turning into the ghosts of tools not yet acquired. The money felt hot, diseased. Every bill he spent was a stitch in the shroud they were all sewing for themselves.

The door groaned open, a sliver of sickly yellow hallway light cutting the gloom. Alain slipped in, a man made of nerves and angles. He moved like a startled bird, his head twitching on a thin neck, eyes darting. He carried the smell of cheap gasoline and cheaper anxiety.

“Léo,” he said, the word a puff of vapor in the chilled air. He didn’t offer a hand.

“Alain.”

“You look like hell.”

“You look like a man about to jump out of his skin. Try to land in one piece. We need a driver, not a puddle of nerves.”

Alain’s laugh was a dry, brittle thing. “Saint-Clair. You’re serious. You’ve finally gone and picked a coffin, haven’t you?” He paced, his shoes scraping on grit. “The things I hear… he doesn’t call the police. He has a private number for the meat wagon. They say he leaves the bodies in the street as a message. A public service announcement.”

“Then we don’t get caught,” Léo said, his voice flat. He walked to a stained workbench where a canvas tool roll lay. He unrolled it with deliberate slowness. Inside, nestled in loops of leather, were his personal picks, probes, and tension wrenches. They were old friends, extensions of his fingers. They felt innocent compared to what he had to buy next. “You’re in deep with the Corsicans, Alain. Deeper than your driving can dig you out of. This is your ladder. One job. A clean exit.”

“Clean?” Alain spat. “Nothing about Saint-Clair is clean. It’s all blood and rust.”

“The alternative is the Corsicans taking your knees as interest. I’m offering you a chance to keep them.”

Alain stopped pacing, his shoulders slumping in defeat. The fight left him like air from a punctured tire. He just nodded, a small, miserable gesture. Another ghost recruited.

The second arrival was announced by a single, solid thud against the metal door. Léo opened it to find Felix Duchene, a block of a man in a worn-out boiler suit, holding a heavy canvas duffel. His face was a landscape of old resentments, his eyes two chips of flint. He didn’t wait for an invitation, just brushed past Léo, his gaze sweeping the room with professional disdain.

“This is it?” Felix’s voice was a gravelly rumble. “A damp hole. Fitting.”

“It’s quiet,” Léo said, locking the door again.

“Quiet as a grave.” Felix dropped his duffel. It landed with a metallic clank. “Twenty years I kept the lights on for the city. Twenty years. Then one bad transformer, one fried executive’s sauna, and I’m out. A pension that wouldn’t feed a cat.” He turned to Léo, the bitterness radiating off him like heat. “And now you. The great Léo Moreau. Fallen so far you need a bitter old wire-monkey for your suicide mission.”

“I need someone who knows how to blind a building,” Léo said, refusing to rise to the bait. “Who can kill a security grid without tripping the silent alarms. Who can make a fortress think it’s just having a bad dream.”

Felix grunted, unzipping his bag. He pulled out schematics, not of the Saint-Clair mansion, but of municipal power grids, substation layouts. “I know how the city eats electricity. I know its veins. Saint-Clair… he’s got his own feed. A dedicated line. But everything connects, somewhere. Everything has a weakness.” He looked up, a cruel smile touching his lips. “Even you.”

The crew was assembled. A trio of broken men, huddled in a blacked-out room, plotting to rob a devil. The claustrophobia was immediate, a tightening band around Léo’s chest. Every word echoed. Every sigh was a judgment. Alain’s jittery energy bounced off Felix’s stolid, simmering rage, and Léo stood in the middle, the conductor of a doomed orchestra.

He spread the surveillance photos on the workbench, weighting the corners with spare bolts. The stark, zoomed-in images of the mansion’s rear service door, the ventilation grates, the windowless wall of the study. Alain paled further. Felix leaned in, his calloused finger tracing lines.

“This isn’t a lock,” Felix muttered, tapping the study wall. “This is a bank vault door welded shut. What’s the plan? Wishful thinking?”

“Thermal lance,” Léo said, the words feeling alien in his mouth.

The room went still. Even Alain’s twitching ceased.

“A lance?” Felix breathed. “In a private home? You’ll set off every heat sensor in the arrondissement. You’ll turn the room into an oven. And the noise… it’s like screaming metal.”

“Not the industrial kind,” Léo said. He pulled a smaller, crisper blueprint from his inner jacket. It was a specialist order, placed through three intermediaries, paid for with half of La Veuve’s blood money. “A custom job. Low-amp, focused burn. Magnesium-thermite composite. It cuts quieter, cooler. Relatively. And we pair it with this.”

From a cardboard box, he lifted a bundle of dense, grey matting. It looked like industrial felt. “Acoustic damping sheets. Barium-loaded. We build a tent around the point of entry. Contains the heat signature, muffles the sound to a dull roar. It’ll still sound like hell, but a quieter, contained hell.”

Felix took a sheet, feeling its weight. “A tent. So we cook inside it while we work. Delightful.” But there was a flicker in his eyes, the grudging admiration of a technician for a clever, if insane, solution.

The door to the safehouse creaked open, letting in a sliver of Parisian twilight. The air outside was thick with the scent of rain-wet pavement and the distant tang of exhaust fumes, a sharp contrast to the stale, ink-laden atmosphere inside. Claire stepped through, her boots leaving faint prints on the concrete floor. She carried a canvas bag slung over one shoulder, the weight of it pulling at her jacket.

Léo didn’t look up from the workbench where he was dismantling a lockpick set. The dim glow of a single bulb cast long shadows across his face, deepening the hollows under his eyes. “You’re late,” he said, his voice flat.

Claire dropped the bag onto the table with a thud. “Traffic. Metro was a nightmare.” She unzipped the bag, revealing a jumble of tools and wires. “Got everything you asked for. And a few things you didn’t.”

Léo finally glanced up, his gaze sharp. “You shouldn’t have taken risks.”

Claire shrugged, pulling out a sleek, black device. “I know what I’m doing. Besides, you’re the one who wanted this job done fast.”

A muscle in Léo’s jaw twitched. “Fast doesn’t mean reckless.”

“Says the man who’s already got half the city’s cops looking for him.” Claire plugged the device into a battered laptop, the screen flickering to life. “We’re running out of time, Léo. Saint-Clair’s not going to wait forever.”

Léo exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. “I know that. But we can’t afford mistakes.”

Claire leaned against the table, her fingers drumming against the metal. “Then stop treating me like a liability. I’m not some amateur you can babysit.”

Léo’s eyes flicked to hers, something unreadable passing between them. “I never said you were.”

The silence stretched, heavy with unspoken words. Outside, the distant wail of a siren cut through the night, a reminder of the world beyond these walls.

Claire broke the silence first. “We need to talk about the layout. Alain said there’s a guard rotation every two hours. We’ll have a window, but it’s tight.”

Léo nodded, his fingers tracing the edge of the workbench. “I know. We’ll have to move fast.”

Claire hesitated, then reached into her bag again. She pulled out a small, silver key. “I got this from the contact. It’s a spare for the back entrance. Less obvious than the front.”

Léo took the key, turning it over in his hands. “Good work.”

Claire smirked. “See? Not a liability.”

Léo’s lips twitched, almost a smile. “No. Not a liability.”

The tension in the room eased, just slightly. Outside, the rain began to fall, a soft patter against the blacked-out windows. The safehouse felt a little less like a tomb, a little more like a place where plans could be made.

For now, at least.

“Procurement is tomorrow,” Léo said. “The rest of the advance covers the lance, the mats, the frequencies for the perimeter jammers. There’s nothing left. No room for error.”

“There never is with you, is there?” Alain whispered, not looking at anyone.

The meeting dissolved into a tense, silent division of tasks. Felix buried himself in his grids. Alain left to “case the approach routes,” a flimsy excuse to escape the suffocating room. Léo was left alone with the ghost of ink and the specter of the job.

He waited until full dark, the kind of deep, city-night that swallows sound. He took a circuitous route, doubling back on the Metro, watching reflections in black shop windows. The guilt was a leaden companion, heavier than any tool roll.

He stopped at an all-night pâtisserie and bought a tarte aux fraises, the kind with the glazed, perfect berries. It sat in its white box on his lap during the final taxi ride to the quiet, tree-lined street in the 16th. Not his street. Never his street.

The building was handsome, old money. He had a key he shouldn’t have, for the service entrance. He moved through the hushed, carpeted hallway like a thief, which he was, and took the back stairs to the second floor.

He knelt before the door of apartment 2B, placing the white box carefully on the mat. From his pocket, he pulled a small, worn plush rabbit, one ear nearly chewed off. He tucked it beside the box. Then he took out a folded piece of paper and a pen. The words wouldn’t come. I’m sorry was an ocean too shallow. I love you felt like a lie coated in sugar.

He wrote, in his tight, controlled script: Ma petite chou – A taste of summer for you. Be good for Maman. I have to go away for work. A big job. I’ll write when I can. – Papa.

Every word was acid on his tongue. Go away. Big job. Write when I can. The vocabulary of a lifetime of small abandonments, culminating in this grand, final betrayal. He saw her face, not as the serious eight-year-old she was now, but as the toddler who would shriek with laughter when he lifted her to the sky. He’d promised her the sky. Now he was leaving her with a pastry and a lie.

He slipped the note under the ribbon of the box, touched the door once, a faint brush of his fingertips against the painted wood, and then he was gone, retreating back into the city’s gullet, the taste of his own deceit bitter and metallic in his mouth.
The procurement was a nightmare of shadows and strained whispers. The contact for the thermal lance was a cadaverous man named Kovač who operated out of a garage that smelled of ozone and fear. The lance itself, when assembled, was a sinister-looking thing: a long, graphite barrel with a pistol grip and a coiled umbilical leading to a compact oxygen-mix canister and a heavy battery pack.

“It will cut through twelve inches of chromoly steel in ninety seconds,” Kovač said, his voice devoid of pride. It was a statement of fact, like announcing the weather. “The flame is blue. Very hot. Very… hungry. Do not point it at anything you do not wish to cease existing.”

He demonstrated on a scrap of armored plate. When he triggered it, the sound was not the deafening roar Léo feared, but a vicious, focused hiss, like a giant serpent. The blue jet that erupted from the nozzle was blinding, a tiny, contained star. It cast stark, frantic shadows that leaped and died on the garage walls. The light was unholy, the color of a gas flame in the heart of a glacier. In seconds, the metal glowed cherry-red, then white, then a molten orange pool slagged onto the concrete floor, smoking and spitting.

Léo felt the heat on his face from six feet away. He saw his own shadow, giant and distorted, thrown against the wall, a monstrous puppet. Felix, standing beside him, muttered something lost in the hiss. Alain took two steps back, bumping into a shelf of rusted tools.

Kovač released the trigger. The sudden silence was a shock. The only sound was the ping of cooling metal and the frantic thrum of Léo’s own heart. The air tasted of scorched iron and vaporized dreams.

They loaded the equipment into Felix’s unmarked van in silence. The damping mats were shockingly heavy. The jammers were cold, anonymous black boxes. The lance, broken down into its components, lay in a custom foam-lined case. It felt less like a tool and more like a dismembered corpse.

Back in the printshop, under the single bare bulb, they laid it all out. Their arsenal. Léo’s elegant picks looked like toys next to the brutal, technological heresy of the lance.

“Test it,” Felix said, his arms crossed. “Here. On something.”

Léo didn’t want to. The memory of that blue flame was seared into his vision. But Felix was right. They had to know. He chose a section of thick, old pipe he’d found in a corner. He and Felix assembled the damping mats into a crude, three-sided booth. Alain watched from the doorway, as if ready to flee.

Léo geared up: heavy leather gloves, a darkened face shield. He hefted the lance. It was heavier than it looked, humming with latent violence. He nodded to Felix, who powered up the battery. A low, electrical whine filled the room.

He positioned the nozzle an inch from the pipe wall, took a breath that did nothing to calm him, and squeezed the trigger.

The hiss was louder in the confined space, a sound of pure, furious consumption. The blue jet stabbed out, and the world contracted to that point of impossible light. The pipe screamed as it was violated, a high-pitched shriek even through the mats. The molten metal bloomed, a dripping, orange flower of ruin. The heat flooded the tiny booth instantly, baking through his clothes. The shadows it cast were not just shadows; they were frantic, jagged things, demons dancing on the walls of their tiny, self-made hell.

It was over in forty-five seconds. A neat, glowing circle slagged away, leaving a hole big enough to put a fist through. Léo released the trigger. The silence that followed was thick, stunned. The air was oven-hot and stank of a chemistry that had no place outside of a forge.

He lifted his face shield. His skin was slick with sweat that felt instantly cold. Alain was staring, mouth agape. Felix was looking not at the hole, but at the lance, his bitter face illuminated by the still-glowing edges of the cut.

He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, his eyes meeting Léo’s in the sickly light. His voice, when it came, was low, stripped of all its earlier sarcasm, filled with a dread that was utterly, chillingly sincere.

“We’re not just cracking a safe, Léo,” Felix said, the words hanging in the toxic air. “We’re opening a coffin.”

Léo looked at the perfect, brutal hole. He saw not an entry point, but an exit wound. And he knew, with a certainty that settled in his bones like frost, that Felix wasn’t talking about Saint-Clair’s vault.

He was talking about theirs.
