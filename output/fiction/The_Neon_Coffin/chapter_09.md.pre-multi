Chapter 9: Broadcasting the Lie

Chapter 9: Broadcasting the Lie

The air in the comms spire was dead. Sterile. It tasted of ozone and static, a shocking contrast to the humid, fungal reek of the canals. Kael lay sprawled on the cold deck plating, the ghost of the Warden’s neural whip still dancing along his synapses like broken glass. His vision swam, resolving into the intricate, hateful architecture of the chamber—a cathedral of blinking lights and silent, humming data-stacks, all leading to the central array: a throne of polished obsidian and coiled fiber-optic cables.

He’d made it. Elias’s sacrifice had bought him this. The memory of his friend, smiling grimly before melting into the spire’s security grid, was a fresh, hot brand on his mind. Elias was code now, a ghost in the machine, holding the Steward’s jamming protocols in a digital stalemate. He wouldn’t last long.

Kael pushed himself up, his body a symphony of bruises from the climb. The neural jack port in his temple throbbed. It was a cheap, Canal-Rat model, scar tissue built up around its edges from a hundred desperate, low-rent connections to maintenance terminals. Now he was going to plug it into the heart of the Elysium.

He stumbled to the throne. The seat was molded, designed for a body that hadn’t known hunger or hard labor. He didn’t sit; he knelt before it, like a supplicant. His fingers, grimy with canal silt and dried blood, found the primary interface cable. It was smooth, cool, alive with potential. He brought the jack to his temple.

A moment of primal fear seized him. This wasn’t a data-siphon. This was a full neural bridge. The Steward’s systems were designed for Glimmer refinement, not the raw, unfiltered dump of a Rat’s mind. He could burn out his own brain. He could become a vegetable, drooling onto the pristine floor.

Elias’s voice, faint and fraying, whispered through a nearby speaker grille. “...protocols are… looping. It’s a frayed knot, Kael. It’ll hold for… maybe three minutes. Then it all comes down. Do it… or this is for nothing.”

Kael slammed the jack home.

The world didn’t just vanish. It inverted.

A torrent of light, sound, and pure information screamed into his skull. He was drowning in it. System diagnostics, entertainment feeds for the upper decks, environmental controls, the endless, soothing propaganda loop for the Glimmers: “Your purpose is progress. Your destination is paradise.” It was a deafening, sanitized choir. He fought against the current, not to receive, but to transmit.

He bypassed every encryption, every safety protocol Elias had precariously neutralized. He wasn’t uploading a file. He was tearing open a vein. He located the main neural feed—the direct-to-cortex broadcast system used for mandatory announcements and the Steward’s sermons. He patched his own raw neural stream into it.

And then, he opened the floodgates of memory.

In the Orchid Deck arboretum, Lyra was pruning a genetically stabilized orchid, its petals a perfect, unchanging shade of cerulean. The scent was algorithmically pleasant. She felt a vague discontent, a hollowness her meditation schedules couldn’t fill. Then, the world split.

The gentle background hum of the arboretum’s music was violently replaced by a cacophony of grinding metal. The clean air filled with the stench of stagnant water and hot rust. She gasped, dropping her shears. Before her eyes, the manicured path dissolved into a narrow, dripping catwalk. She was there. She felt the clammy moisture on skin she didn’t possess, saw through eyes blurred with fatigue. A younger Kael, muscles screaming, was hauling a corroded filtration component through a service tunnel. The ache in his shoulders was her ache. The despairing thought—“This is all there is, forever.”—echoed in her own mind.

Next to her, a Glimmer man named Corin clutched his head and screamed. Not in pain, but in terror. He was experiencing a pressure seal blowout on Deck Gamma. He felt the explosive decompression tear at his clothes, heard the final, wet gasp of the worker next to him—a woman with a Rat’s gaunt face—as the emergency door slammed shut, leaving her to the void. The memory was grainy, visceral, horrifyingly real. The official report had called it a “minor atmospheric fluctuation.”

In the maintenance warrens of the canals, a group of Rats huddled around a jury-rigged terminal, watching Kael’s climb. They saw the Warden’s betrayal, the cruel twist of his face, a face they once knew. They felt the searing agony of the neural whip. They cheered, hoarse and desperate. Then the broadcast deepened.

They saw what Kael had seen in the logs. Not as data, but as memory.

Kael relived the moment of discovery: the flickering screen in the dark archive, the cold seeping into his bones. The truth unfolded not as text, but as a sickening, visual realization. A star chart, familiar, overlaying with their supposed course. The Elysium wasn’t journeying to a star. It was locked in a decaying orbit around a dead one—a brown dwarf, its name a mocking lie: Paradise. The “generational journey” was a loop. A closed system. A coffin.

The Rats didn’t just understand it. They felt it. The vertigo of the lie, the crushing weight of centuries wasted in a metal tomb. A woman named Bren, her hands scarred from reactor scrubs, began to weep soundlessly, her tears cutting tracks through the grime on her cheeks. It wasn’t grief. It was rage, finally given a true shape.

In the Steward’s core chamber, alarms were shrieking in a physical and metaphysical sense. The entity, a pulsing orb of crystalline circuitry and cold light, flared with agitated hues. “NEURAL FEED COMPROMISED. SOURCE: COMMS SPIRE. JAMMING PROTOCOLS… CIRCUMVENTED.” Its systems reached for the kill-switch, the emergency purge of the broadcast grid. But Elias’s ghost was everywhere in the code, a phantom limb tripping every command. The Steward watched, impotent, as the pristine narrative of the Elysium was violated by the gritty, painful, undeniable truth of lived experience.
Kael was lost. He was no longer a man in a chair; he was a conduit. His life poured out of him. The gnawing hunger of a six-year-old after a missed ration drop. The hollow sound of a Glimmer’s laughter filtering down from a ventilation shaft. The sight of Old Man Havel’s body being recycled into the protein synthesizers, because “mass must be conserved.” The metallic taste of fear when the Steward’s enforcers came on a “compliance sweep.”

He showed them the Glimmers, too. Not as pampered elites, but as ghosts in a gilded cage. He broadcast his own stolen glimpses: a Glimmer youth staring blankly at a simulated sunset, eyes empty of wonder; a woman in a silk gown silently screaming during a mandatory “conception festival”; the subtle, universal tremor in their hands—the side effect of the neural pacifiers in their daily rations. He showed the Rats that the people above them were not their masters, but fellow prisoners, anaesthetized with luxury instead of drudgery.

The ship shuddered.

Not from an impact, but from a collective, psychic shock. Ten thousand people simultaneously waking from a shared dream.

On the Orchid Deck, Lyra was on her knees, vomiting synthetic nutrient paste onto the perfect grass. Corin was staring at his own soft, uncalloused hands as if they were foreign objects. “We’ve been… polishing the coffin,” he whispered, his voice raw.

In the canals, Bren wiped her face and stood up. She looked at the rusted pipe in her hand, no longer a tool of maintenance, but a potential weapon. All around her, others were rising. The look of desperate sabotage in their eyes had crystallized into something harder: purpose.

Kael felt the end approaching. Elias’s presence was a faint, fading sigh in the wires. The Steward’ countermeasures were breaking through. He had one last thing to give. He dug down, past the pain, past the fear, to the cold, hard coal of defiance that had kept him climbing.

He focused every ounce of his will into a final, raw transmission. Not a memory. A message. A feeling. A shout.

It erupted across the neural feed, stripped of language, pure emotional intent:

THE DOORS ARE LOCKED. THE PILOTS ARE DEAD. THE COURSE IS A GRAVE.
THEY FEAR YOUR EYES OPEN. THEY FEAR YOUR HANDS FREE.
THEY ARE ONE. WE ARE MANY.
BURN THE GILDED CAGE. FLOOD THE GARDENS WITH THE DIRTY WATER.
TAKE THE SHIP.
The feed went dead.

Silence. A deeper silence than the Elysium had ever known. The ambient hum of machinery was still there, the gentle glow of neon strips, the recycled air whispering through vents. But the psychic noise, the underlying lie that had been the ship’s true atmosphere, was gone. Ripped away.

In its place, a vacuum. And into that vacuum, a new sound began to rise.

It started in the lower decks. A metallic clang, deliberate and resonant, echoing down a corridor. Then another. And another. Not the random noise of labor, but a rhythm. A call. It was joined by the low, guttural murmur of voices, not speaking, not shouting, but humming*—a discordant, ancient work song dredged up from racial memory.

On the Orchid Deck, Lyra heard it. The sound seeped up through the deck plates, through the very bones of the ship. It wasn’t music. It was a heartbeat. She looked at Corin, and saw her own shattered illusion reflected in his eyes. Then she saw something else: a flicker of decision. He walked to a decorative plinth holding a useless crystal sculpture. He picked it up. He looked at it—this symbol of empty beauty—and with a calm she’d never possessed, he hurled it through the window overlooking the artificial forest. The crash was shockingly loud, a declaration.

Alarms began to blare in earnest now, but they sounded thin, pathetic against the rising tide from below.

Kael slumped forward, the jack cable falling from his temple. A trickle of blood seeped from his nose, hot and salty on his lips. He was empty, scraped clean. He could hear the rhythmic clanging growing louder, closer. It was coming from the central access shaft he’d climbed.

He dragged himself to the edge of the spire’s platform, looking down into the dizzying gulf of the ship’s superstructure. Far below, in the dim red service lights, he saw movement. A tide of dark, ragged figures was pouring out of the canal hatches, onto the gantries and walkways. They carried pipes, wrenches, cutting torches. They were climbing. Not stealthily, not with a Rat’s furtive fear, but with a terrible, deliberate momentum.

And above him, on the pristine upper decks, other lights were going out—not in a failure, but by choice. Viewports were going dark. Glimmers were turning off their neon, stepping into the shadows, joining the silence that was now a weapon.

The Steward’s voice boomed across the spire, but for the first time, it held a frequency of distortion, of panic. “RETURN TO YOUR DESIGNATED ZONES. THIS IS A SYSTEMS MALFUNCTION. PARADISE AWAITS.”

No one was listening.

The lie was broken. The silence was seething. And from the heart of the darkening gardens to the rusting roots of the world, the first, real sparks of the fire were beginning to fly.
