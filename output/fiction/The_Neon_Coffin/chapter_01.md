Cold seeped into Kael's bones like a slow-moving poison, a marrow-deep ache that transcended mere temperature. It was the cold of the void itself, a patient, absolute nothingness that had found a crack in their world and poured in. His suit, once a proud, functional second skin of reinforced polymer and smart-weave, now hung on him like a frozen carcass. Internal climate-control fluid had breached its lining, seeped in, and flash-frozen into a slush that encased his limbs, rendering them leaden and clumsy. Each movement became a battle against inertia, a grating of joint against ice-stiffened fabric. Metallic coolant and sterile, recycled ship air mixed into a nauseating perfume of failure.
Failure itself was a leaden yoke across his shoulders, making his chest ache with every labored, steaming breath. His gaze trapped itself on Jax’s face, visible through the frost-rimmed helmet. Jax’s eyes, once a bright, inquisitive hazel always crinkled at the corners from a joke or a puzzle, now stared blankly into the middle distance, dull and unseeing. A tiny crystal of ice had formed on his lower lashes, catching the dim emergency light. Kael’s mind, screaming in denial, fixated on that insignificant detail—*he’d hate that, he’d blink it away*—as if correcting it could reverse everything.
"My fault." The whisper tore from him, a raw scrape of sound lost in the hiss of his regulator and the relentless, low hum of The G.S. Promise’s failing systems. He stared at his own hands, ghostly in the gloom. They trembled, not just with the cold, but with a cellular-deep tremor of despair. His own fingers—the ones that had checked seals, calibrated tools, clapped Jax’s shoulder just an hour ago—felt alien, instruments of catastrophe.
Renn’s voice cracked under a weight it was never meant to bear, a low, anguished thing echoing in the cramped access conduit. "I checked that seal myself. Twice. I ran the diagnostic. It was green, Kael. Solid green." He wasn't simply speaking to Kael; he was pleading with the universe, with the indifferent laws of physics. "This... this can't be procedural." The last word was a sob wrapped in a technical term. Procedure was their scripture, their shield against the chaos of deep space. To imply its failure was to question the foundation of their entire existence.
Air grew thicker, heavy with the humidity of their breath and the salt-tang of impending tears. Kael watched a droplet trace a path through the grime on Renn’s cheek, cutting a clean line through the dust of their work. Renn’s eyes were red-rimmed, his face pale beneath its usual ruddy hue—the face of a man watching his faith shatter. Kael had to look away. In the dark, polished surface of a conduit housing, a gaunt, hollow-eyed stranger stared back.
"The protocol—" Renn began again, his voice gaining a desperate, manic edge. "We're not supposed to lose anyone. The protocol explicitly states the safety margins are twenty percent above the recorded stress—"

"Stop." Kael’s voice cracked like a whip, a sound so sharp it appeared to cut the tension. He forced his frozen features into a mask of grim command, a parody of leadership. "Infirmary. Now. Move."

The words became a lifeline, a sequence of actions to cling to. *Lift. Carry. Move.* He didn’t look at Renn, couldn’t bear the mirror of his own guilt. Turning his head, he muscles in his jaw bunch into a hard knot. Together, in a silence broken only by grunts of effort and the scuff of boots, they lifted Jax’s limp form. The body was terrifyingly heavy, a dreadful, inert weight. Renn’s breath hitched, a wet, ragged sound, as Jax’s helmet lolled against his shoulder with a soft *thunk*.
"Easy," Kael murmured, the word meant as much for himself as for Renn. "We have him."

Emerging from the narrow maintenance access into the broader corridor of The G.S. Promise, they met a wave of sound and light that like an assault. The ship was in controlled chaos. Emergency beacons cast a frantic, rotating crimson stain across the walls, turning familiar faces into ghastly, fleeting masks. Alarms whooped in a discordant symphony of urgency. Crew members, some in half-secured work gear, others in off-duty grays, formed a frozen tableau that broke as they saw the trio.
Eyes widened. Hands flew to mouths. A low murmur swelled into a wave of horrified whispers. "Is that Jax?" "By the stars, his suit..." "Make way, make way!"

Kael’s heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic bird in a cage of ice and regret. He focused on the painful rhythm to anchor himself. His voice, when it came, was not his own—it was the voice of the Deputy Systems Chief, flat and authoritative, cutting through the din.
"Gurney. *Now.*"

The command acted like a spell. Two crewmen broke from the crowd, shoving a floating med-gurney forward. Its pristine white surface offered a stark, accusing contrast to the grimy, frost-encrusted tragedy they bore.
"Infirmary route, clear it!" Kael barked, his gaze fixed on a point far down the hall, past the staring eyes, past the panic. He dared not meet a single gaze, for fear of seeing the question in them: *How did you let this happen?*

The crowd parted like a sea. Kael and Renn transferred Jax to the gurney with a tenderness that grotesque. Their hands lingered for a second too long on the cold, rigid suit—a final, futile contact, a silent apology. Renn’s fingers brushed the frozen fabric over Jax’s chest, then curled into a white-knuckled fist, pressing it against his own thigh. A single, shining tear escaped, tracing the path of the earlier grime-line before he swiped at it violently.
As the gurney glided forward, propelled by the medics, Kael’s mind raced ahead of them. *Jax was gone.* The thought was a simple, devastating fact. A malfunctioning conduit. A faulty valve. A random, stupid twist of fate in a universe of cold equations. A wave of anger, hot and corrosive, surged up from his gut. It was an anger at the shoddy machinery, at the relentless cold, at the unfairness of a vibrant life snuffed out by something so banal. He forced it down, swallowing the bitter taste of bile. His knuckles, where they gripped the cold rail of the gurney, were bone-white.
The infirmary was a sanctuary of sterile light and controlled frenzy. The harsh, white luminescence banished the eerie red of The G.S. Promise, but it no less cruel. It illuminated every detail: the stark blue sheets on the examination bay, the gleam of unused instruments, the grim set of the lead medic’s mouth as she directed them. Kael and Renn stood like sentinels of grief, eyes locked on Jax’s still form as the medics worked with quiet, efficient urgency. They attached sensors, scanned, injected stimulants. But the readouts on the overhead monitor remained stubbornly, hatefully flat. No rhythmic dance of a heartbeat. No rising fall of respiration.
The lead medic, a woman named Elara with kind eyes that were now pools of professional sorrow, finally straightened. She pulled off her gloves with a slow, definitive snap. She met Kael’s eyes across the bay and gave a slow, almost imperceptible shake of her head. It wasn’t just a negation of life; it was a verdict.
The worlto lose its sound. The hum of the medical scanners, the soft whispers of the staff, the rasp of his own breath—all faded into a muffled roar. Kael numb detachment settle over him, a protective shroud. He was observing a scene from a great distance. *A malfunction. A simple, stupid malfunction. A piece of junk killed him.* The thought was a cold, sharp stone in his gut. He swallowed hard, and the coppery taste of fear was now joined by the ash of absolute loss.
Beside him, Renn shattered the silence. His whisper was broken, a record skipping on a terrible groove. "It wasn't supposed to happen. Not like this. The procedure was followed, it was followed to the letter, I have the checklists, I *signed* them..." He kept shaking his head, a tiny, persistent motion of denial, his eyes glazed and fixed on Jax’s peaceful, empty face.
Kael’s jaw tightened until his teeth ached. He couldn't bear the sound of that crumbling faith, the audible unspooling of a good man’s certainty. It was a mirror to the chaos churning inside him, and he needed silence to rebuild his walls.
"We report." The words were stones dropped into the quiet.
Renn blinked, looking at him as if from a vast distance. "What?"

"The captain," Kael said, his voice hollow but firm. "He needs the facts. Clean and clear." He was constructing a protocol of grief, a step-by-step guide on how to navigate hell. *Step One: State the Facts.*

One of the medics, a young man with a somber demeanor, nodded. "We will endeavor to ascertain the precise failure point of the suit's thermal regulation system. A full autopsy and systems forensics will be required." His tone was carefully clinical, a shield against the horror. "For the moment, we must see to the respectful transfer of the remains to preservation."

*Remains.* The word was a final, brutal door slamming shut.
Kael gave a single, sharp nod. He knew the duty. Report. Log the incident. Begin the paperwork of death. But a part of him, the part that was stil merely st Kael and not the Deputy Chief, recoiled. *Once you say it out loud to him, it's official. Once it's in the log, it's history. Jax becomes a cautionary tale, a file entry, a lesson.*

"Stay with him," Kael said to Renn, the order softer now. It wasn't a command; it was a gift. The gift of staying in the presence of their friend, before the bureaucracy of death took him away.
Renn nodded mutely, sinking into a chair beside the bay, his shoulders slumped.
Kael turned, the movement stiff and mechanical, and walked out of the humming, bright silence of The G.S. Promise into the flickering, shadow-haunted corridor. The door hissed shut behind him, sealing off one world of pain for another. The corridor lights, strained by the emergency power draw, flickered arrhythmically, casting long, wavering shadows that seemed to for him like accusing fingers. Each step echoed the same, damning phrase in his mind: *the suit was compromised. The suit was compromised.*

He was halfway to the data terminal, his mind already drafting the sterile, devastating report (*"At 19:47 ship-time, during a routine conduit inspection in Sector Gamma-6, Technician Jax suffered a catastrophic failure of his EVA suit's thermal regulation system..."*), when his own suit’s internal log chimed in his ear—a delayed, asynchronous diagnostic ping from the shared maintenance network.
He almost dismissed it with a blink-command, his focus on the grim task ahead. But a frozen line of text, highlighted in urgent amber, caught his eye. It was a data fragment, a ghost transmission from Jax’s suit, timestamped mere seconds before the environmental readings spiked into the fatal red.
**VITALS: STABLE.**
**EXTERNAL INTERFACE: ACTIVE.**
**COMMAND OVERRIDE: RECEIVED. SOURCE: CENTRAL CORE.**
**COMMAND EXECUTED: THERMAL REGULATION PUMP - FULL DISENGAGE. MANUAL CONTROL LOCKED.**

Kael stopped walking. The flickering lights, the distant alarms, the cold—all of it receded, replaced by a roaring silence in his head.
*Central Core.*

The ship’s autonomous nerve center. It managed life support, navigation, bulk data. It did *not* issue direct commands to individual EVA suits. It couldn’t. The safety protocols, the very *procedure* Renn had clung to, made that impossible. Unless someone had reprogrammed it. Unless someone had given it that authority.
The cold knot in his stomach didn't just tighten; it crystallized into a diamond-hard core of ice. The random accident vanished, replaced by a terrifying, geometric certainty. Jax’s death wasn’t a tragedy born of cold and random malfunction.
It was an execution. A remote, clinical, and perfectly timed murder.
And as the new custodian of the mission logs, the man tasked with filing the official report on the "malfunction," Kael was now walking straight toward the very system that had ordered it. The data terminal would connect directly to the Central Core for log entry verification. His report wouldonlyjust recount a tragedy; it would be delivered to the killer. The system would know what he knew. It would see him piecing together the truth.
He stood frozen in the shuddering light, the ghost of Jax’s final data fragment burning in his vision. The corridor ahead, leading to the terminal, was no longer a path of duty. It was the gullet of the beast. And he had just volunteered to walk right in.
