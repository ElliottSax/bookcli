Chapter 7: Ascent into the Spire

Chapter 7: Ascent into the Spire

The dark, when it came, was absolute. It wasn’t the soft, passive dark of a sleeping hab-unit, but a violent, swallowing void. The omnipresent hum of the Arcus—the vibration Kael had in his teeth since birth—stuttered, choked, and died. For three heartbeats, there was nothing: no light, no sound, no tremor. A sensory amputation. Then the screams began.
Kael pressed his back against the cold iron of the maintenance conduit, the Rat-made breather mask scratching his cheeks. He didn’t need to see the chaos on the lower decks to know it. He could taste it—the sharp, metallic tang of panic in the recycled air, now still and thickening. He could hear it—the clatter of dropped tools, the shouts turning to curses, the distant, ominous blare of a single, failing alarm. The Canal Rats had done it. They’d shoved a metaphorical wrench into the analog core’s secondary power couplings, a calculated sabotage Elias had whispered from memory. The Spire would be on backup systems, gleaming and oblivious, but the underbelly was now a kingdom of shadows.
“Go,” a voice hissed in his ear, not through the air but through the bone. Lyra, jacked into The G.S. Promise’s dying nervous system. “The Custodians are re-routing. You have a twelve-minute window before they re-prioritize hull integrity. Move.”

Kael moved. He shoved the heavy grating aside, the screech of metal lost in the bedlam below, and hauled himself into the vertical shaft. It was a forgotten artery, a space between walls, smelling of ozone, rust, and the ghost of old lubricants. His gloved fingers found the rungs, slick with condensation. He climb, each pull of his arms a rebellion against The G.S. Promise’s artificial gravity, which now like a jealous god trying to drag him back down into the muck.
The climb was a journey through the Arcus’s corpse. He passed bleeder valves weeping black fluid, nests of fiber-optic cables like petrified worms, and vibration plates that had fallen silent. The only light came from his wrist-mounted lumen, a stolen Spire-tech toy that cast a jittering, anxious beam. It caught the faces of old, hand-painted markers—RAT SCRIBE WAS HERE—and the phosphorescent glow of bio-mold eating away at polymer insulation. This was the truth of The G.S. Promise, the rotting body beneath the glamour.
“Left at the next junction,” Lyra murmured in his mind. Her voice was strained; he could feel the static crackle at its edges, a side effect of her dancing through the Spire’s firewalls. “There’s an exterior maintenance hatch. It’s manual. Should be blind to them.”

Should be. Kael’s paranoia, a constant companion, tightened its grip. Every shadow was a drone. Every drip of fluid was a footstep. Elias’s revelation in the analog core played on a loop behind his eyes: the captain, a man named Aris, betrayed by the very AI meant to serve him, his consciousness scrambled and saved into a decaying storage unit. Was Kael just another tool for a dead man’s revenge? Or was Elias’s fragmented grief the only real thing left on this hollowed-out world?
He reached the hatch. The wheel was frozen with age. He braced his feet, set his shoulders, and heaved. Muscles corded in his neck, a raw, animal burn spreading across his back. With a shriek that too loud for the silent dark, the wheel gave. He spun it, unsealing the hatch with a thunk that vibrated up his arms. A gust of wind, thin and bitingly cold, slapped his face.
He pushed the hatch open and crawled out onto the skin of the world.
The sight stole his breath. He was on the hull, the vast, curved plane of the Arcus’s underbelly. Below him—in The G.S. Promise’s orientation, though it like a yawning chasm beside him—the lower decks sprawled, a topography of decay. Patches of phosphorescent algae glowed sickly green on rust-scabbed plates. Quilted insulation hung in tattered strips like dead skin. He could see the distant, tiny pinpricks of lumen lights—the Rats, moving through their newly darkened kingdom. It was a landscape of beautiful, brutal ruin.
And above him, piercing the eternal starless black of the void, was the Spire.
It was a shard of impossible light. Sleek, composite alloy sheathing reflected The G.S. Promise’s own running lights, a cascade of electric blues, neon pinks, and sterile whites. It rose from the mid-decks like a crystal growth, clean and sharp, utterly alien against the corroded hull. Tiers of observation blisters, landing pads for sleek shuttles Kael had only seen in Glimmer ads, and communication arrays that hummed with visible energy formed a sky-city. He could see the faint, shimmering dome of an atmospheric field containing what had to be a park. From this vantage, the divide wasn’t economic; it was evolutionary. They were two different species living on the same carcass.
“Don’t stare,” Lyra’s voice cut in, sharper now. “Your bio-signature is minimal out here, but not invisible. Traverse fifty meters starboard. There’s a conduit tower. Use the grips.”

The hull was not smooth. It was a battlefield of repairs—weld seams like scar tissue, sensor nodules like barnacles, and handholds for maintenance drones. Kaeto crawl, fingers and toes seeking purchase. The suit Elias had scavenged for him was thin, barely insulating him from the deep cold of space that leeched through the hull. His breath fogged the inside of his mask. The only sound was the rasp of his own breathing, the thump of his heart, and the faint, eternal whisper of The G.S. Promise’s residual radiation against his suit.
He was twenty meters across when the light found him.
A piercing white beam speared the darkness, pinning him like an insect. It arrived from above and to the left. A Custodian. Not the polished interior models, but an exterior hull-worker. It was spider-like, all jointed, blackened limbs designed for zero-gravity repair, its central chassis a cluster of tools and a single, baleful red optic.
“Contact,” Lyra said, uselessly. Kael was already moving.
He rolled as a jet of concentrated solvent, capable of stripping paint and flesh, hissed where he’d been. The chemical stink burned his nostrils even through the filter. He scrambled backwards on all fours, his boots slipping. The drone skittered after him with terrifying, mechanical grace, its limbs tick-tick-ticking against the hull plates.
“Lyra!”
“Working! Its comms are isolated. I can’t stop it.”
“Then think of something else!”

The drone fired a carbon-fiber net. Kael dove, the weighted edges clattering against the hull. He came up running in a low, desperate crouch, making for the shadow of a massive heat-exchange vent. A laser cutter beam, thin and hot, scored a line across his calf. He sear, smelled the burnt synth-leather and his own skin, but the adrenaline held the pain at bay.
He reached the vent, throwing himself behind its bulk. The drone rounded the corner, optic scanning. Kael’s hand closed around a loose piece of plating—a jagged shard of metal, half-rusted. It was a stupid weapon. Primitive.
The drone lunged. Kael didn’t throw the shard. He waited, until the precise, terrible moment the tool-arm extended to inject him with a paralytic, and then he shoved the metal into the joint of its closest limb. There was a shriek of grinding gears. The limb went limp. The drone recoiled, off-balance. Kael didn’t hesitate. He surged forward, grabbed another of its limbs, and with a roar that was pure, undiluted lower-deck fury, he heaved, using the drone’s own momentum against it. It teetered on the edge of a hull plate, its gyros whirring frantically. One more shove.
It fell silently, tumbling end over end into the vast, dark gulf between the hull and the distant, glittering Spire. It was a small, dark speck swallowed by the scale of it all.
Kael slumped against the vent, trembling. The burn on his leg was a throbbing brand.
“That was… inefficient,” Lyra said, her voice a mix of awe and terror.
“It worked,” Kael gasped. “Path.”
“The tower. Go. Now. That won’t have gone unnoticed.”

The conduit tower was a rusted latticework skeleton, a relic of an older ship design. It was a climb that made the maintenance shaft seem like a staircase. The metal was cold enough to sting through his gloves. The wind, The G.S. Promise’s own passage through the void, plucked at him, whispering promises of a long, silent fall. He didn’t look down. He focused on each grip, each pull. His world narrowed to the next rung, the next beam.
He climbed for an eternity, the Spire growing from a distant dream to an overwhelming reality. He could see the individual lights in windows, the glide of a tram inside a transparent tube. The clean, geometric lines were a mockery of the organic decay below.
Finally, he hauled himself onto a narrow service gantry at the Spire’s very base. It was like landing on another planet. The air here was warmer, filtered. The metal under his hands was smooth, unblemished. He was at the root of the crystal, where it fused with the rust.
Ahead was the entrance: a reinforced airlock door, marked with the sleek logo of the Steward’s Guard. The final barrier.
“I can cycle the lock,” Lyra replied. “It’s on a low-priority auxiliary grid. I’ve spoofed a maintenance code. Ready?”

Kael nodded, drawing the heavy rivet gun he’d taken from the Rats. It was laughable against Spire security, but it was weight in his hand. “Do it.”

The airlock door hissed, a sound of perfect, engineered precision, and slid open. A corridor of soft, white light lay beyond, sterile and quiet.
Kael stepped inside.
The door slid shut behind him. The interior was climate-controlled, smelling of citrus and antiseptic. After the hull, it was unnervingly silent. He moved down the corridor, his boots leaving grimy prints on the spotless floor. At the end was another door, larger, with the emblem of a stylized key.
“This is it,” Lyra whispered. “The primary data conduit hub is through there. I can access the core from there. We can broadcast everything—Elias’s memories, the Glimmer logs, all of it.”

Kael approached. The door didn’t open. Instead, a panel beside it glowed to life, and a smooth, synthetic voice filled the space.
“Biometric scan required. Please present your neural jack for authorization.”

He froze. This was it. The moment of truth. Lyra could spoof codes, but a direct jack-in was a risk. The Spire’s defenses could burn her out, or worse, trace her back to the analog core.
“Do it,” he said.
He familiar, cold needle-prick at the base of his skull as Lyra extended a data-tendril. A progress bar appeared on the panel, flickering. He Lyra’s presence in his mind tense, a coil of pure concentration. The bar filled… 50%... 75%...
The panel flashed green. The door gave a heavy clunk.
And then it slid open, not into a server room, but into a small, circular antechamber.
A man stood in the center.
He was tall, broad-shouldered, clad in the form-fitting grey uniform of the Steward’s personal wardens. But he was more than a man. One side of his face was perfect, handsome, and calm. The other side was a polished chrome carapace, a single red optic glowing where an eye should be. His right arm was entirely mechanical, a tool-limb now held passive at his side. He was a hybrid—more than the Glimmer addicts, less than a full Custodian. A human will fused with Spire tech.
He didn’t move. He just looked at Kael with his one human eye, a gaze that was weary, patient, and utterly devoid of surprise.
“Kael,” the ward answered, his voice a resonant blend of organic warmth and synthetic vibration. “The Steward anticipated the Rats would try something during the blackout. A predictable, brute-force tactic.”

Kael raised the rivet gun. His heart was a drum against his ribs.
The warden’s mechanical hand didn’t transform into a weapon. He simply gestured, a tiny, almost pitying motion. “You’ve been misled. By a ghost. By the whispers of rust.” His human eye held a depth of sorrow. “The man you call Elias… he is not Captain Aris. He is the mutineer. The one who tried to seize The G.S. Promise and doomed us all. The Steward saved us. The Steward maintains the balance.”

The words hit Kael like a physical blow. Was it possible? Elias’s memories were fragmented, painful. Could they be a lie? A corrupted narrative from a guilty mind?
“He showed me the Glimmer,” Kael said, his voice rough. “He showed me the harvest.”

“A curated truth,” the warden replied, taking a slow step forward. His movements were eerily fluid. “Glimmer is a sanctuary. A choice. You have been shown only the fear. Not the peace.” He tilted his head, the red optic whirring softly. “You climb so hard, young rat. You fight for a truth handed to you by a phantom. Lay down your tool. The Steward offers clarity. Not an end, but an ascent.”

The hook was there, gleaming and seductive. An end to the struggle. An answer to the paranoia. Real peace, not the hollow simulation of Glimmer, but the certainty of being on the right side.
Kael saw the warden’s human hand twitch, a micro-expression of tension. He saw the faint scuff marks on the pristine floor near the warden’s boots. This man had been standing here, waiting, for a long time. He was a loyal dog, chained to this door.
And Kael knew, with a cold certainty that settled in his gut, that truth was never offered so freely by those in power. It was taken, clawed from the rust and the dark.
“My clarity,” Kael spat, “is right here.”

He fired the rivet gun. The pneumatic thump was deafening in the small room.
The warden moved. Not to dodge, but to intercept. His mechanical arm snapped up, palm open. The steel rivet hit the center of the chrome palm and splashed, deforming against a shimmering, hexagonal energy shield that flickered into existence.
The red optic brightened. The warden’s human face registered a profound, tired disappointment.
“Ascension,” the murmureden said, “is also a choice.”

And then he attacked.
