    <h1>The Shadow Protocol</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Discovery</h2>

    <p>Sarah Chen stared at her computer screen. The data was impossible, yet undeniable. Someone was manipulating the markets using quantum computing.</p>
    <p>She reached for her phone, but it rang first. Unknown number.</p>
    <p>"Dr. Chen," a voice said. "We need to talk about your research."</p>
    <p>Her blood went cold. "Who is this?"</p>
    <p>"Someone who knows you've been asking dangerous questions."</p>
    The lights went out.
<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>
Sarah grabbed her laptop and ran for the stairs. Behind her, footsteps echoed in the darkness. They'd found her.
    <p>The hard drive in her pocket contained everything&mdash;proof of the algorithm, the Shadow Protocol, the impossible predictions. She couldn't let them take it.</p>
    <p>Glass shattered above her. They were closing in.</p>


    <h2>Chapter 2: The Choice</h2>

    <p>Director Walsh sat across from Sarah in the speeding SUV. Outside, Boston blurred past in streaks of light.</p>
    <p>"You have two choices," Walsh said, her voice calm despite the chaos. "Help us, or disappear."</p>
    <p>Sarah clutched the hard drive. "What is the Shadow Protocol?"</p>
    <p>"That's what we need you to figure out." Walsh pulled out a tablet, showing a map covered in red dots. "These are the people hunting you. They're three blocks away."</p>
    <p>The SUV swerved around a corner. Gunfire shattered the rear window.</p>
    <p>"Down!" Walsh shouted.</p>
    <p>Sarah ducked as bullets ripped through the interior. This was insane. Twenty-four hours ago, she'd been a professor. Now she was in a high-speed chase through Boston, hunted by killers.</p>
    <p>"Make your choice, Doctor," Walsh said, returning fire through the broken window. "In or out?"</p>
    <p>Sarah looked at the approaching red dots on the screen, at Walsh's unwavering determination, at the shattered glass glittering in the streetlights.</p>
    "In," she said.
<div class="scene-break">* * *</div>
The SUV crashed through a warehouse door. A helicopter waited inside, rotors spinning.
    <p>Hands pulled Sarah aboard as bullets pinged off metal. The helicopter lifted off, and through the open door, Sarah watched her old life shrink beneath her.</p>
    <p>There was no going back now.</p>


    <h2>Chapter 3: Task Force</h2>

    <p>The safe house was deep underground, accessible only by a high-security elevator. Sarah stepped out into a command center that rivaled anything she'd seen at MIT.</p>
    <p>Dozens of workstations, massive screens displaying financial data, satellite imagery, encrypted communications. This was no ordinary government operation.</p>
    <p>"Welcome to Task Force Quantum," Walsh said. "Population: twelve. You make thirteen."</p>
    <p>A woman approached&mdash;mid-thirties, sharp eyes behind wire-rim glasses. "Dr. Sarah Chen. I've read your papers on quantum computing applications. Brilliant work, though completely theoretical."</p>
    <p>"Maya Rodriguez," Walsh introduced. "Our lead analyst. She'll bring you up to speed."</p>
    <p>Maya handed Sarah a tablet. "The Shadow Protocol has been active for five years. In that time, it's siphoned 2.1 trillion dollars from global markets. We've been tracking it, but we can't crack the algorithm."</p>
    <p>Sarah scrolled through the data. The pattern was there&mdash;subtle, elegant, impossible to predict without quantum computing. Whoever built this was a genius.</p>
    <p>"Who's behind it?" Sarah asked.</p>
    <p>"We don't know," Maya admitted. "The organization is ghost. No names, no faces, no paper trail. Just results."</p>
    <p>Walsh joined them. "That's where you come in. You found a pattern we missed. You might be able to find more."</p>
    <p>Sarah looked at the data again. The algorithm was beautiful in its complexity&mdash;layers upon layers of quantum entanglement, predictive modeling, market manipulation. It would take months to fully understand it.</p>
    <p>"I'll need time," she said. "And resources."</p>
    <p>"You have unlimited resources," Walsh replied. "But time... that we don't have." She pulled up a new screen. "The Shadow Protocol is accelerating. Whatever they're planning, it's happening soon. Maybe weeks. Maybe days."</p>
    <p>Sarah felt the weight settle on her shoulders. The fate of the global economy, potentially millions of lives, resting on her ability to crack an algorithm she barely understood.</p>
    <p>"Where do I start?" she asked.</p>
    <p>Maya smiled. "With coffee. Lots of coffee. Then we'll show you what we've got."</p>
    <p>As Sarah followed Maya deeper into the command center, she realized Walsh was right. Her normal life was over. But maybe, just maybe, she could make this one count.</p>
    <p>The hunt for the Shadow Protocol had begun.</p>
