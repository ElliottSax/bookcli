# How to Find API Keys in Oracle Cloud Console

## Step-by-Step Navigation:

### 1. Click Your Profile Icon
- Top right corner of Oracle Cloud Console
- It's a circle with your initial or icon

### 2. Click "User Settings" (or your username)
- This opens your user details page

### 3. Look for "Resources" Section on Left Sidebar
- You should now be on a page with your user information
- On the LEFT side, there's a section labeled **"Resources"**
- This section might be collapsed - if so, click to expand it

### 4. Scroll Down in Resources
- Under "Resources" you should see:
  - Capabilities
  - Groups
  - **API Keys** ← This is what you want!
  - Auth Tokens
  - Customer Secret Keys
  - OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials
  - SMTP Credentials

### 5. Click "API Keys"
- This shows your existing API keys (probably empty)

### 6. Click "Add API Key" Button
- It's a blue button on the right side

## Alternative Method (If You Still Can't Find It):

Use the search bar at the top of Oracle Console:

1. Click the **Search** bar (top of page)
2. Type: **"API Keys"**
3. Select the result for API Keys
4. This should take you directly there

## Or Use Direct Navigation:

The direct path in Oracle Console is:

**Identity & Security** → **Users** → **[Your User]** → **API Keys**

To get there:
1. Click the hamburger menu (☰) top left
2. Go to: **Identity & Security**
3. Click: **Users**
4. Click on **your username** in the list
5. You'll see **API Keys** in the left sidebar under Resources

## Still Can't Find It?

Try this URL pattern (replace with your console URL):
```
https://cloud.oracle.com/identity/domains/my-user/users/<your-user-ocid>/api-keys
```

Or just tell me what you see on the screen and I'll help you navigate!
